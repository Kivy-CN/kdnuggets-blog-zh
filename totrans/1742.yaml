- en: Many organizations are associating data monetization with selling their data.
    But selling data is not a trivial task, especially for organizations whose primary
    business relies on its data. Organizations new to selling data need to be concerned
    with privacy and Personally Identifiable Information (PII), data quality and accuracy,
    data transmission reliability, pricing, packaging, marketing, sales, support,
    etc. Companies such as Nielsen, Experian and Acxiom are experts at selling data
    because that’s their business; they have built a business around gathering, aggregating,
    cleansing, aligning, packaging, selling and supporting data.

    the customer, product and operational insights that are gleaned from the data;
    insights that can be used to optimize key business and operational processes,
    reduce security and compliance risks, uncover new revenue opportunities, and create
    a more compelling customer and partner engagement.

    insights, the Analytic Profile is indispensible. While I have talked frequently
    about the concept of Analytic Profiles, I’ve never written a blog that details
    how Analytic Profiles work.  So let’s create a “Day in the Life” of an Analytic
    Profile to explain how an Analytic Profile works to capture and “monetize” your
    analytic assets.

- en: Analytic Profiles provide a storage model (think key-value store) for capturing
    the organization’s analytic assets in a way that facilities the refinement and
    sharing of those analytic assets across multiple business use cases. An Analytic
    Profile consists of metrics, predictive indicators, segments, scores, and business
    rules that codify the behaviors, preferences, propensities, inclinations, tendencies,
    interests, associations and affiliations for the organization’s key business entities
    such as customers, patients, students, athletes, jet engines, cars, locomotives,
    CAT scanners, and wind turbines (see **Figure 1**).

    tracks individual purchase transactions via a registered on-line account and/or
    a loyalty program (e.g., retail, hospitality, entertainment, travel, restaurant,
    financial services, insurance). You’ve been asked to apply data and analytics
    to help the organization “increase same location sales” by 5%.

- en: To support the “Improve Campaign Effectiveness” use case, the data science team
    worked with the business stakeholders to brainstorm, test and confirm that they
    needed to build Demographic and Behavioral Segments for each individual customer.
    The Demographic segments are based upon customer variables such as age, gender,
    marital status, employment status, employer, income level, education level, college
    degrees, number of dependents, ages of dependents, home location, home value,
    work location and job title.  The Behavioral segments are based upon purchase
    and engagement transactions such as frequency of purchase, recency of purchase,
    items purchased, amount of money spent, coupons or rebates used, discounts applied,
    returns and consumer comments.
