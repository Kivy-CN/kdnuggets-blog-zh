- en: '[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source platform allowing developers
    to build, package, and distribute portable applications. It has become an essential
    data science tool to assist in the building of reproducible and scalable environments.
    Docker allows code and dependencies to be packaged in containers, which lets data
    scientists distribute their models across different platforms. This assists in
    both development and production, and works to prevent errors and inconsistencies
    that can arise from different versions of software or hardware configurations.
    Docker can also help teams collaborate effectively, by assuring a consistent environment
    across all developers and team members.'
