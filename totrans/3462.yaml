    that is to say, an awful lot of businesses. Here I choose a few areas where it’s
    possible that big corporations haven’t already eaten everybody’s lunch. It’s not
    uncharted territory — if I could think of the next killer application, I’d be
    trying to do it!

- en: So-called after the California Gold Rush where the purveyors of picks and shovels
    made a killing (whereas the outcome for prospectors was mixed), the picks and
    shovels of machine intelligence are hardware, data feeds,and (arguably) the algorithms themselves.

- en: It’s striking that algorithm developments for machine intelligence have been
    overwhelmingly open source. Of course there are exceptions — last year, Oxford
    University filed a patent on an efficient alternative to backprop called the [Feedback
    Alignment Algorithm](http://isis-innovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/insights75.pdf) (page
    14) — I wonder how they intend to commercialise it? High quality SaaS offerings
    that make it easy for people to utilise learning algorithms will find eager customers,
    and [MetaMind](https://www.metamind.io/), bringing cutting-edge deep learning
    to your dataset, is one such with all the right credentials. Another initiative
    I like is [The Automatic Statistician](http://www.automaticstatistician.com/) project,
    which searches models to discover the best explanation for your data using Bayesian
    inference. [The Curious AI Company](http://www.thecuriousaicompany.com/), a General
    AI company whose first venture is waste sorting (the very definition of unsexy
    but lucrative), [reportedly](http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/02/do-androids-dream-of-curious/) aims
    to sell its AI software as a toolkit.

    recent acquisition of The Weather Channel data assets for $1.5bn](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2999630/big-data/ibm-acquires-the-weather-channel-when-technology-vendors-become-data-vendors.html)).
    But focus to date has been on the low-hanging fruit such as social or ecommerce
    data, so there’s still opportunity where data is harder to acquire and/or to label. [Affectiva](http://www.affectiva.com/)’s
    database of facial emotional responses is in this category, as are [Pallas Ludens](http://pallas-ludens.com/) (end
    to end data annotation service), and [opensensors.io](http://www.opensensors.io/) (adding
    value to public sources of sensor data). Genome and medical image data — subject
    to some knotty privacy issues — will enable personalised treatment and care, and
    better diagnostics. On that note, it will be interesting to see how[Genomics England

    with humans. [Jibo](https://www.jibo.com/), the ‘friendly’ robot, is a fascinating
    example using only an ‘eye’ to express itself. There will surely be inexpensive
    toys that are adaptive and responsive (like [Paro](http://www.parorobots.com/) the
    therapeutic seal robot, but for play), although I haven’t managed to find any
    yet. These would have the advantage of avoiding the privacy concerns of conversational
    toys like Toy Talk and Mattel’s ‘[Hello BarbieTM’](https://www.toytalk.com/product/hello-barbie/),
    at least until voice can be processed locally rather than in the cloud.
