- en: It's no secret that machine learning - more specifically, **deep learning**
    - has been playing an increasingly noticeable role in the world of art, as of
    late. From [Deep Dream](https://github.com/google/deepdream/blob/master/dream.ipynb),
    to [Deep Forger](/2015/12/deep-learning-art-forgery.html), to [Beyond the Fence](/2016/01/beyond-fence-advent-creative-machines.html),
    and further, all varieties of art have been touched by the *creativity* of neural
    networks, and it seems that this has not gone unnoticed by those outside of the
    direct sphere of machine learning.

    at NYU, has recently started up his inaugural offering of Machine Learning for
    Artists, an elective course in the school''s [Interactive Telecommunications Program
    (ITP)](https://www.kickstarter.com/pages/itp). The ITP has the mission of exploring
    "the imaginative use of communications technologies," and how they may be leveraged
    for bringing art and delight into the lives of individuals. They self-identify
    as "a Center for the Recently Possible," a term I think is fantastic.'

    deep learning understanding which would be both transferable and reusable. Directly

- en: This course will not cover, nor assumes knowledge of, the technical or mathematical
    details of machine learning, instead focusing on how to integrate available tools
    into existing interactive applications, although resources for learning the technical
    aspects will be provided. The tools we use will be platform-agnostic, making it
    easier to add machine learning into existing applications. Programming ability
    will be helpful in customizing the provided tools, but is not required.

- en: The class really seems to focus on what can be done with machine learning, vis-a-vis
    creating, and bettering, art. The most recent addition of a recurrent neural networks
    lecture suggests that this course will not be solely focused on the visual arts,
    as it makes a foray into text-generation and character-level models.

    of **Machine Learning for Artists** [here](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a.github.io/tree/master/_posts),
    and view the figures and interactive demos as they become available [here](http://ml4a.github.io/dev/demos/).

- en: We congratulate fine institutions such as NYU for their recognition of the importance
    of making their quality course material freely and openly available to the public;
    we likewise tip our hats to Gene Kogan for his recognition and interest in doing
    the same.
