    intelligence (AI) and machine learning, but very few talk about how to *fail*
    with such technologies. While the technology is incredibly powerful — and heavily
    hyped — there is a plethora of ways to fail with AI.
  prefs: []

- en: This post summarizes nine *creative* ways to condemn almost any AI startup to
    bankruptcy. I focus on data science and machine learning startups, but the lessons
    on what to avoid can easily be applied to other industries.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Artificial intelligence requires heavy investment in cutting-edge research,
    experimentation, advanced algorithms, and computing infrastructure. Any AI startup
    hoping to develop useful AI technologies will have to spend a great deal of money
    on research and development (R&D) in these areas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As tempting as it may be to downsize spending in this area, cutting R&D costs
    will quickly pave the way to failure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Technology is very much bound to the social circumstances in which it is created.
    Technology is never *self-sustaining*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Artificial intelligence has failed several times throughout the history of computer
    science, not only due to technological issues — that could be and were solved — but
    also because of a lack of social need and interest at the time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The lesson to be learned is that artificial intelligence technologies cannot
    be built in isolation from the social circumstances that make them necessary (like
    health care, disease research, and finance).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A new technology is only successful when its proponents generate interest in
    it and obtain resources from the same people who will become their end users or
    customers. Before engineering the technology itself, visionaries and entrepreneurs
    should first engineer people, persuading them to suspend their doubts and embrace
    the novelty and utility of disruptive ideas.
  prefs: []

    to failure.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Technology alone is *not* enough to achieve success, no matter how powerful
    or transformative it may be. At the end of the day, a tech startup is still a
    business and needs a solid business strategy to succeed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any startup that lacks a strategy for identifying target markets, generating
    sales, and effectively allocating and spending resources, but gives priority exclusively
    to their technological assets, is doomed to fail (and quickly).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For any tech company to succeed, it’s crucial to quickly establish a clear vision.
    This is especially important for AI companies since the technology has applications
    for many diverse industries (from finance to health care).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This vision should be communicated early and often to employees so that everyone
    is on the same page about the company mission and roadmap. In addition to this
    long-term vision, having clear short-term goals and objectives is also essential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI companies are also software companies. And software that gets written for
    its own sake, without satisfying any business need, won’t sell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Useless software, no matter how objectively cheap to develop, is ultimately
    very expensive to build and maintain because there’s no pay-off. If it provides
    no value for potential customers, it’s a waste of time and resources to develop
    and ultimately adds no value to your company.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'While self-confidence is essential for maintaining high development standards,
    if left unchecked, it could lead to problems down the line. Organizations with
    over-inflated self-confidence have a tendency to fall into one of the biggest
    traps of product design: arrogance.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This attitude is common in startups. Assuming that their own products are the
    best, such organizations tend to develop everything in-house, even tasks that
    could easily be outsourced. Not only does this waste valuable time and resources,
    it also prevents teams from focusing on their core business.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to failure.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is specific to software companies (and definitely AI companies).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In software design, it’s important to develop fast and release faster, even
    if the product is imperfect. Why? Because software that’s built behind closed
    doors doesn’t do any good; it needs to be out in the real world, exposed to real
    users with real problems. By releasing early and often, you can gather useful
    data, learn what works and what doesn’t, and iterate to produce the best possible
    version of your product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The benefits of moving to market quickly outweigh the drawbacks. Taking the
    risk of disclosing features to competitors is the price to pay for getting immediate
    (and frequent) feedback from users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Staying in a never-ending *design-develop-design* loop, leads to missed opportunities
    and messages from the market. This is a sure way to fail.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To users, software is an experience. Developers, on the other hand, see software
    as a tool. Product design should be focused around customers, not developers (unless
    developers *are* the customers).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The misconception that customers are just like developers is typical of startup
    culture and toxic for tech companies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers tend to focus on the technical aspects of a product, prioritizing
    function over form. Unfortunately, they often ignore design and the user experience.
    For any AI product to be successful and widely adopted, it must be both functional
    *and* well-designed for ease of use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing an AI product that satisfies only its developers’ vision and needs
    leads to unmet requirements in the real market. In a word, failure.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not the first time that AI is getting a lot of hype. The first time
    was in the ’80s, when professors claimed that computers would soon replace humans
    (which obviously didn’t happen). But now AI is being heavily hyped again, and
    this time appears to be different. Hype that lasts five years without any sign
    of slowing down is not just hype. It’s a steady trend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, hype alone is not enough for a technology to succeed. AI developers
    have to put their money where their mouth is and build products that actually
    live up to the hype.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assuming that an AI startup will succeed simply because of the hype surrounding
    their core business is the first step towards failure.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To build a successful AI startup, you first have to know how to fail. That means
    confronting and correcting your erroneous assumptions, mismatched priorities,
    and unfocused strategy.

    to succeed with AI.
