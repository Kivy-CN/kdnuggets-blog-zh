    to labeling. The labelers’ monument could be Atlas holding that large rock symbolizing
    their arduous, detail-laden responsibilities. ImageNet — an image database — would
    deserve its own stele. For nine years, its contributors manually annotated more
    than 14 million images. Just thinking about it makes you tired.

    Labeling is an indispensable stage of data preprocessing in [supervised learning](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/supervised-learning-use-cases-low-hanging-fruit-in-data-science-for-businesses/).
    Historical data with predefined target attributes (values) is used for this model
    training style. An algorithm can only find target attributes if a human mapped
    them.

    the key reasons to choose an internal approach to labeling. That’s why when you
    need to ensure the highest possible labeling accuracy and have an ability to track
    the process, assign this task to your team. While in-house labeling is much slower
    than approaches described below, it’s the way to go if your company has enough
    human, time, and financial resources.

    of a company’s reviews on social media and tech site discussion sections allows
    businesses to evaluate their reputation and expertise compared with competitors.

    strategy.

    that performs adequately. Assuming that labeling a single comment may take a worker
    30 seconds, he or she will need to spend 750 hours or almost 94 work shifts averaging
    8 hours each to complete the task. And that’s another way of saying three months.
    Considering that the [median hourly rate for a data scientist in the US](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Data_Scientist%2C_IT/Salary)
    is $36.27, labeling will cost you $27,202.5.

- en: You can streamline data labeling by **automating** it with semi-supervised learning.
    This training style entails using both labeled and unlabeled data. A part of a
    dataset (e.g. 2000 reviews) can be labeled to train a classification model. Then
    this multiclass model is trained on the rest of the unlabeled data to find target
    values — positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

    to teeth grinding sounds, a client listened to samples and mapped them with attributes.
