- en: Data visualization is a broader term that describes any effort to help people
    understand the importance of data by placing it in a visual context. Patterns ,trends,
    and correlations can be easily shown visually which otherwise might go unnoticed
    in textual data. It is a fundamental part of the data scientist’s toolkit. Creating
    visualisations is pretty easy but creating good ones is much harder. It requires
    an eye for detail and good amount of expertise to create visualisations which
    are simple yet effective. Powerful visualisation tools and libraries are available
    today which have re defined the meaning of visualisation.

- en: The beauty of using Python is that it offers libraries for every data visualisation
    need. One such library is **Folium** which comes in handy for visualising Geographic
    data (**Geo data).** Geographic data (**Geo data**) science is a subset of data
    science that deals with location-based data i.e. description of objects and their
    relationship in space.

- en: Folium is a powerful data visualisation library in Python that was built primarily
    to help people visualize geospatial data. With Folium, one can create a map of
    any location in the world as long as its latitude and longitude values are known.
    Also, the maps created by Folium are interactive in nature, so one can zoom in
    and out after the map is rendered, which is a super useful feature.

    mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. The data is manipulated in Python
    and then visualised in a Leaflet map via folium.

    to the label in the json object which has the country code as the feature ID attached
    to each country’s border information. This it the tie that we need to set up in
    our data. Our country code in the data frame should match the feature ID in the
