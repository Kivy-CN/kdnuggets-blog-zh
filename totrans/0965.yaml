    and control. The company is fairly new, having started in 2018 with the vision
    to reduce the time to insight, and accelerate the time to value, for customers.
    In 2019, they had a clear focus on the true principles of DevOps and extracting
    value from volume in IoT time series data in order to develop technology around
    DataOps.

    but it was very interesting to understand the concept of data and Formula 1.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He was able to tell us that one of the biggest challenges he faces as a Senior
    Data Scientist is the lack of data. The racing sport does not happen often, so
    when it does there is very little data to work with. And once they collate this
    data, the process takes so long that the particular racing season has ended and
    is of no value at the time. The team can use it for the next season, but that
    still makes the current process harder.

    are specific websites in which they get their data, most which are available to
    the general public. However, the information that broadcasters see on their screen
    such as the lap speed and gears - the data McLaren team do not have access to
    these stats. Therefore, the team has other team members watching the race and
    noting down every stat in order to collate data.
