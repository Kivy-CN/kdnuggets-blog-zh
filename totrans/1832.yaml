    model of development. This allows them to minimize the risk to be able to have
    improvements when collecting capital to finance themselves. Once they found the
    market fit, the issue will be about the growth, to achieve a balance point.

- en: For those startups based on data (nowadays, most of them consider their data
    as a strategic active for the decision making), to find a model that interprets
    them is a difficult task. Extract/collect data, measure, model and making decisions
    is a common road for any startup that aims to a dynamic, changing, fludid sector
    of the market.

    model/s, but finding it/them (determine the modelling technique, setting parameters
    and adjustment) may be a very long, and sometimes, non-aligned task with the business
    times. For example: it does not make sense a model to “predict the results of
    a football match” that finds the results after the match was played. So, how startups
    can minimize this risk when launching a new app? Do they need so much deployment
    to enter the market, do they have the necessary resources? In 7Puentes we understand
    they do not and that is why we coined a new concept: MVM (Minimum Valuable Model).'

- en: MVM is based on the principle that data-based startups need to have affordable
    data science models for their financial reality but also, these models have to
    be acceptable in terms of accuracy. This working methodology based on minimum
    and effective models, minimizes the risks in the event the product does not succeed
    in the market and, therefore, is an obstacle less in regards to the launching.

- en: 'A data science model with 75% of accuracy, which is acceptable to guarantee
    the well-functioning of the app, takes 25% of the time. To escalate to a 100%,
    i.e., to a perfect model, exponentially increases the time used and the required
    investment. If we think a model of recommendation for an app like “Tinder”, a
    MVM does not need the 10 offers to be ideal, but, to have out of 10 offers an
    average of good offers and, maybe, a low percentage of very bad offers. It is
    not necessary to develop a prediction algorithm 100% effective and it is not feasible
    in financial terms. Every sector/project has its “good-enough”: sometimes the
    priority is a quick response but in other cases the covering is the focus.'

- en: To find a MVM, it is necessary a constant dialogue between the areas that define
    the business goals and the data scientist.  It is no use the specialist working
    only two months with the data, since finding the MVM requires to pay attention
    to what data provide. Many times, the business areas require a very precise model
    with training data that is not enough, they are noisy or they do not adjust to
    the thought model.  Maybe it is better to reduce the scope of the model to the
    portion of the data where it better works and, in the future, expand the coverage
    of the model when the startup has better financial resources.

    and cleaning of data. And the time for modeling, experimenting and communicating
    results is too short. So that MVM model comes to accelerate the knowledge extraction
    process from a “lean” perspective.'
