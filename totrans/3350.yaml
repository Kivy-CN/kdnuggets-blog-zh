- en: Last year I wrote [an overview post](/2016/03/data-science-puzzle-explained.html)
    which defines a number of key concepts related to data science -- including data
    science itself -- and attempts to explain how these pieces fit together into a
    so-called "data science puzzle." As a new year begins, and a previous year worth
    of advances, insights, and accomplishments get rolled into our collective professional
    outlook, I thought it would be prudent to revisit this puzzle, noting and incorporating
    any changes and updates which may contribute to rearranging the puzzle for the
    foreseeable future, and to provide some addition commentary where warranted.

    -retention from a business point of view, expectations that Big Data projects
    start providing actual financial returns, and the challenges related to data privacy

    The goal of data science is to extract insight from data, and machine learning

    will increasingly become an industrial strength force to be reckoned with, assisting
    data scientists with a variety of machine learning and modeling tasks, but not
    supplanting data scientists... not yet, at least. *Interpretation* of models is
    still required, and while the nuance and finesse of the human eye cannot be entirely
    outsourced to machine learning pipelines, much of the algorithm and feature selection
    can, as can the assessment and comparison of multiple models in a search for the
    best fit.

    **data mining** (with which, I assume, most people can identify). I think that
    the lines between the 2 disciplines are becoming even more blurred than in the
    past (if that's possible). I previously stressed that machine learning was a *tool*
    facilitating the data mining *process*; however, as machine learning becomes a
    more mainstream term, I foresee their accelerated widespread confounding.

    network technologies -- neural network architectures (which are particular types
    of machine learning algorithms) with multiple hidden layers -- to solve problems.
    As a process, deep learning is to neural networks as data mining is to "traditional"
    machine learning (this is a somewhat flawed comparison lacking nuance, but at
    a very high level I stand by it).'

    uptick in attention and hyped success this past year. However, I definitely see
    it (slowly) becoming more of a go-to tool for data scientists over the next few
    years. As it becomes a go-to classification technology, however, it becomes increasingly
    important to remember that *deep learning is not a panacea*, nor is it even a
    valid option in a wide variety (majority?) of cases. Also, [deep learning and
    artificial intelligence are not synonymous](/2016/08/artificial-intelligence-dead-long-live-deep-learning.html).

    in the form of *inspiration* and *motivation*. As you may have noticed, however,
    AI has a perception problem. Just as data mining used to be a mainstream term
    that struck fear into the hearts of many (mostly related to the invasion of privacy),
    AI frightens the masses from an entirely different viewpoint, one that evokes
    SkyNet-style fears. I don''t know whether we [thank the media](/2016/08/stop-blaming-terminator-for-bad-ai-journalism.html),

    to admit that there is some continually evolving "concept creep" going on any
    more, beyond the regular ol'' confusion and confounding that has always taken
    place. And that''s OK; these fields all started out as niche sub-disciplines of
    other fields (computer science, statistics, linguistics, etc.), and so their constant
    evolution should be expected. While it is important on some level to ensure that
    everyone who *should* have a basic understanding of their differences indeed possesses
    this understanding, when it comes to their application in fields such as data
    science, I would humbly submit that getting too far into the semantic weeds doesn''t
    provide practitioners with much benefit in the long term.'
