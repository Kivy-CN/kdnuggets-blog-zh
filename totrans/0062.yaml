  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My journey into the world of AI and software engineering began in my childhood
    with a keen interest in programming. This passion led me to pursue an undergraduate
    degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [NIT Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in/),
    where I graduated in 2015\. I then joined [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com)
    through a campus placement, in which I later joined the Bing Maps team within
    the Search and AI organisation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my time with Bing Maps, I contributed to several projects aimed at improving
    the service. My most notable contribution was leading the development of a new
    machine learning algorithm to enhance label density detection on maps. I wrote
    a research paper on the new technique that received several awards and was published
    in the Microsoft Journal of Applied Research.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After maps, I became a founding member of the Bing Shopping vertical. There,
    I led the launch of multiple features coupled with product ads, playing a significant
    role in bolstering Bing's revenue. I love innovating and solving everyday problems.
    I have won numerous hackathons throughout my career, the last one being where
    I created an AI chatbot designed to streamline online grocery shopping. Currently,
    I'm back at Bing Maps, working on innovative ways to refine and expand our mapping
    services.

    with unknowns and a determination to solve complex problems.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think the move from data science or analytics to AI is often smoother than
    people realise. Both fields demand a strong foundation in math and programming.
    But, if you're a data professional wanting to pivot, you will need to drill down
    on machine learning algorithms and neural networks.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first questions professionals usually ask is the educational prerequisites
    for getting into AI. Do you need a Ph.D., or will a bachelor’s or master's degree
    suffice?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer varies depending on the role and the company. While a Ph.D. can be
    beneficial, especially for research positions, it's not a strict requirement.
    A bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, mathematics, or a related
    field can suffice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What’s crucial is a deep understanding of the principles of AI and machine learning,
    which can be acquired through specialized courses and self-study.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certifications can help demonstrate your interest and foundational knowledge
    in AI, especially when transitioning from a different field. But they should complement
    your education and experience, not replace them. It's important to note that certifications
    are not a golden ticket.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They serve best when used to supplement real-world experience and a solid foundational
    education. Employers typically look for hands-on experience and problem-solving
    capabilities, which can sometimes be gained outside of certification programs.

    algebra, calculus, and statistics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    courses like [Coursera’s Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/collections/machine-learning).
    [EdX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) also offer
    programs like the MicroMasters in Artificial Intelligence and Nanodegrees in AI,
    respectively.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Python remains the go-to language in both fields, for AI, you'll also
    need to get your hands dirty with specialized libraries like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). They provide the building blocks for designing,
    training and validating models with efficiency and scalability. [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
    are also crucial for prototyping and sharing models with peers.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One effective way is by engaging in personal projects. Tailor these projects
    to solve problems you’re passionate about or that address gaps in current technology—this
    will make the learning process more enjoyable and the outcome more impactful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, contributing to open-source projects can not only hone your skills
    but also get you noticed in the community. Another avenue is participating in
    competitions, like those on Kaggle, which challenge you to apply your skills to
    novel problems and learn from the global community.
  prefs: []

- en: Internships are invaluable, offering mentorship and hands-on experience in industrial
    settings. Even if unpaid, the practical knowledge gained can be a significant
    stepping stone. Practical experience isn’t just about coding—it’s also about understanding
    how AI can be deployed effectively to solve real-world issues.

    leaders in the field on social media. Engage in discussions, seek mentorship,
    and don’t shy away from asking questions. Relationships can open doors that may
    otherwise remain closed. Real-world problems offer the best learning experiences.
