    data](https://www.dataoptimal.com/data-cleaning-with-python-2018/). This is a
    huge pain point for teams. If you can show that you’re experienced at cleaning
    data, you’ll immediately be more valuable. To create a data cleaning project,
    find some messy data sets, and start cleaning.

- en: Another important aspect of data science is exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    This is the process of generating questions, and investigating them with visualizations.
    EDA allows an analyst to draw conclusions from data to drive business impact.
    It might include interesting insights based on customer segments, or sales trends
    based on seasonal effects. Often you can make interesting discoveries that weren’t
    initial considerations.

    are useful for both data science teams, as well as more business-oriented end
    users. Dashboards allow data science teams to collaborate, and draw insights together.
    Even more important, they provide an interactive tool for business-oriented customers.
    These individuals focus on strategic goals rather than technical details. Often
    the deliverable for a data science project to a client will be in the form of
    a dashboard.

    Now before you run off and start building some deep learning project, take a step
    back for a minute. Rather than building a complex machine learning model, stick
    with the basics. Linear regression and logistic regression are great to start
    with. These models are easier to interpret and communicate to upper level management.
    I’d also recommend focusing on a project that has a business impact, such as predicting
    customer churn, fraud detection, or loan default. These are more real-world than
    predicting flower type.

    results is what separates the good data scientists from the great ones. It doesn’t
    matter how fancy your model is, if you can’t explain it to teammates or customers,
    you won’t get their buy-in. Slides and notebooks are both great communication
    tools. Use one of your machine learning projects and put it into slide format.
    You could also use a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) or [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
    file for a communication project.
