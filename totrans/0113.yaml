    an integral part of my workflow. I rely on them to generate code, conduct statistical
    tests, comprehend new terminologies, and produce analytical reports and summary
    papers. However, my experience improved significantly when I switched to Poe.

    on ChatGPT, I have to start a new chat session. Poe lets me switch between models
    like Claude+ and Sage with a single click, whereas ChatGPT only offers GPT-4 and
    GPT-3.5-Turbo.
