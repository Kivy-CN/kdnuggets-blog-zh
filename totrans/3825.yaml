- en: '[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) is a free integrated
    development environment (IDE). It is popular among developers and data practitioners.
    The VSCode provides rich functionalities, extensions (plugins), **built-in** **Git**,
    ability to run and debug code, and complete customization for the workspace. You
    can build, test, deploy, and monitor your data science application without leaving
    the application.'

- en: I have tried multiple IDEs, and to be honest, I find VSCode the best as it provides
    a lightweight, powerful, and customizable work environment. The biggest plus point
    of this IDE is the huge collection of extensions for all kinds of IT professionals.

    is your AI assistant. It will suggest a line or whole function. GitHub Copilot
    uses OpenAI codex to provide real-time suggestions. The best part of the extension
    is that it learns from users'' behaviors. Whenever I have to write a similar Python
    script it will suggest the **comments**, **function**, and **docstring**. I just
    have to press “Tab”.'

    with Python extension provides super charge language support. It will provide
    you with parameter suggestions, code completion, auto imports, type check, and
    semantic highlighting. It is highly recommended as it has improved my Python development
    experience by **2X**. Pylance is far more than autocomplete for Python.'

    code and **Enter**, it will provide you with the correct Python indentation. It
    works with bracket pairs, hanging indents, keywords, and extending comments.'

    Indentations. This extension has helped me debug code fast and write effective
    code. Indent-rainbow colorizes the indentation in front of your text, alternating
    four colors for each step.'

    and supports all the programming languages. For example, **Julia**, **R**, **Scala**,
    and **SQL**. It combines Jupyter functionalities with VSCode extension to provide
    the ultimate Python development experience. Jupyter comes with fast `.ipynb` file
    loading, **notebook diff-tool**, Python and Pylance integration, and code folding.'

    extension is language support similar to Python and R. In my opinion Julia is
    the future of machine learning and data science. The extension comes with syntax
    highlighting, snippets, **Julia REPL**, code completing, linter, hover help, and
    debugging. Similar to R, it provides a plot gallery, grid viewer for tabular data,
    and the ability to test, build, and benchmark programs.'

    a new and in my opinion **MVP** extension for versioning and tracking your machine
    learning experiments. Every data team depends on it to version the dataset for
    reproducibility purposes. Apart from data, you can version metadata, plots, models,
    track and store experiments, create data and ML pipelines, and share it like a
    Git. The extension comes with experiment tracking, dashboard, live tracking, and
    GUI-based data management.'

    brings your Git repository to life. Instead of typing scripts on the terminal,
    you can use an interactive user interface to perform all Git-related tasks. It
    comes with revision navigation, **current line blame**, **authorship**, **file**
    **annotation**, sidebar view, Git command palette, and customizable menus and
    toolbars. It improves your development experience by providing visual composing,
    seamless team collaboration, and ability to analyze project progress.'

    is the best task tracking extension. You can find multiple todo extensions that
    might be helpful for your particular development environment, but Todo MD allows
    you to set priority tasks, and track daily tasks, projects, tags, and context.
    By using **Markdown** syntax, you can create your list of tasks with special tags
    such as “overdue” or filter your tasks related to specific simple tags and special
    tags.'

    of data science solutions such as [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github),
    [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker),
    and [Kubernetes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools).
    The extensions that I have mentioned are necessary for me to build, test, and
    run Python scripts daily.

    in the comments. I am always looking to improve my current workspace by replacing
    old extensions with better alternatives. I am currently looking to automate my
    workflow using **GitHub Actions**, and I am open to suggestions.
