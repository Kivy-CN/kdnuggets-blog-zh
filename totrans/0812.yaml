    signifying varying degrees of a company's advancement in utilizing its data assets.
    Within this context, the concept of a Data Maturity Model naturally emerges as
    a hierarchical pyramid composed of different layers. Moreover, the journey toward
    greater data maturity is an ongoing cycle of enhancements, aimed not only at reaching
    increasingly advanced levels but also at refining and optimizing the capabilities
    already attained.

    plane tickets, taking into account train and bus transfers, and other trip details.
    Solving this case requires a fairly specific and limited set of data. However,
    the level of reporting or data management in the organization may not have evolved
    enough to support this feature with existing data. In this case, you are not dealing
    with a data pyramid because the first two levels cannot be used as a foundation
    for AI/ML — your AI/ML level is afloat. Building analytical systems that “float”
    is extremely difficult, but possible, as a means to accelerate time-to-market,
    and to quickly test specific AI use cases in production. Advanced development
    of the foundational pyramid levels will most likely be delayed, but the system
    will eventually attain its final and sustainable pyramid form.

    building fundamental data platforms that can serve as a foundation for analytics
    and other data-driven subsystems and solutions. Data engineers are responsible

    of batch and streaming processing is not much different; the only exceptions are
    data lineage, security and discovery – and in general in what we call data governance.

    raw data from Google Analytics for a medium-sized online company might account
    for half of all processed data. Whether it's worthwhile to ingest this data at
    the same speed as transactional system data, potentially at a high cost, is debatable.
