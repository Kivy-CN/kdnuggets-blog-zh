    my journey through YouTube and my blog. I had no idea what I was doing. I’d never
    coded before but decided I wanted to learn machine learning.

    have all the answers but I reply to as many as I can. The most common question
    I get is “where do I start?” The next most common question is* “*how much math
    do I need to know?”

    a pile of numbers in a table can be hard for humans. We much prefer seeing a graph
    with a line going through it. Making visualizations is a big part of communicating

    small projects of your own. These don’t have to be elaborate world-changing things
    but something you can say “I’ve done this with X”. And then share your work via
    Github or a blog post. Github is used to showcase your code, a blog post is used
    to show how you can communicate your work. You should aim to release one of each
    for every project.
