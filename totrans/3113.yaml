    (or GANs), Autoregressive models (ARs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Generative Adversarial Networks.** GAN models use generative and discriminative
    networks in a zero-sum game framework. The latter is a competition in which a
    generative network produces data samples, and a discriminative network (trained
    on real data) tries to define whether they are real (came from the true data distribution)
    or generated (came from the model distribution). The game continues until a generative
    model gets enough feedback to be able to reproduce images that are indistinguishable
    from real ones.'

    networks — models used for object recognition tasks. Such projects require specialists
    to prepare large datasets consisting of text, image, audio, or video files. The
    more complex the task, the larger the network and training dataset. When a huge
    amount of work must be completed in a short time, generating a labeled dataset
    is a reasonable decision.

    that eliminates the need for manual labeling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Known as data programming, it entails writing labeling functions — scripts that
    programmatically label data. Developers admit the resulting labels can be less
    accurate than those created by manual labeling. However, a program generated noisy
    dataset can be used for [weak supervision](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/weak_supervision.html)
    of high-quality final models (such as those built in TensorFlow or other libraries).
