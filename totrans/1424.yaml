    New trends, new tools, new outlooks... We recently put together a trilogy of articles
    with the insights of a few dozen experts in order to map out the key events of
    2019, and to lay out predictions on where things are headed in 2020 (and likely
    beyond). These article approach the subject matter from the differing points of
    view of research, technology, and industry. If interested, you can find these

    science and related salaries as we come to the end of another year. In order to
    find some single point of comparison, and try our best to find apples to compare
    to one another, we will be focusing on the role of a **data scientist** in the
    **United States**, but will also take a few related roles and a couple of additional
    countries into account further on.

    (most recently updated Oct 22, 2019) that the median data scientist salary in
    the US is $91,260, with a range of $62k - $138k (see Figure 1).

    and a range of $970 - $15k (see Figure 2).

    which is based at least in part on sound reasoning. Figure 3 shows salary trends
    commensurate with years of experience.

    both the upward trend as well as reasonable expected salaries based on experience
    at various intervals. Clearly a new data scientist should not be expecting the
    median in their first role (and neither should one with ten years of experience),
    and the above helps answer what a reasonable expectation would be.

    sense of complicated data from a variety of sources. To earn a midpoint salary
    of $125,250, data scientists need business savvy and communication skills in addition
    to statistics, mathematics and computer science expertise. Knowledge of programming
    languages such as Python or Java is often necessary for the job as well.

    turn to the [Stack Overflow Coding Salary Calculator](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/16/coding-salaries-in-2019-updating-the-stack-overflow-salary-calculator/)
    (Oct 16, 2019). This report is an overview of the salary calculator, which "is
    based on the comprehensive data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, and
    this large, extensive survey data allows us to build an accurate model that reflects
    trends in how coding work is being compensated around the world."

    can be accounted for by high education and high experience levels alone. Data
    scientists are highly paid, but not more so than a similarly educated developer
    doing other kinds of work. (Both bachelor’s degrees and even higher degrees are
    associated with significantly increased pay for people who code.) Over the past
    several years, data science and data engineering work have been moving away from
    an extreme outlier position into the mainstream of software work.'

    is undoubtedly a lot of crossover in the types of skills that a contemporary coding
    data scientist possesses and those which a developer does, on a technical level.
    That said, the comments on higher education acting as a primary (they allude to
    it being a sole) contributor to higher salaries for data scientists is not outlandish.
    However, these may be apples to oranges comparisons; we would need to have access
    to the raw data of the salaries of similarly highly educated data scientists as
    well as non-data scientist developers, otherwise normalized, in order to draw
    such conclusions.

    good question... without much of an answer. Of course, you probably knew coming
    into this that there would not be a single, magical number once we were finished.
    You do, however, now have some data to help make some reasonable forecasts as
    to what fair salaries would be under a variety of different circumstances. Let's
    see what 2020 brings to the data scientist salary discussion.
