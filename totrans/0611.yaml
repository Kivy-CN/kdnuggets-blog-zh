- en: As both the written and spoken-language corpora available to us explode in ubiquity,
    natural language processing (NLP) has become an invaluable tool to researchers,
    organizations, and even hobbyists. It lets us summarize documents, analyze sentiment,
    categorize content, translate languages – and one day potentially even converse
    at a human level.

    change as both practitioners and researchers dive into the prospects it presents.
    While the NLP landscape is rapidly changing, here are some of the trends and opportunities
    I see on the horizon.

- en: '“[Prompting](https://thegradient.pub/prompting/)” is a technique that involves
    adding a piece of text to your input examples to encourage a language model to
    perform a task you’re interested in. Say your input text is: “We had a great waitress,
    but the food was undercooked.” Perhaps you’re interested in comparing food quality
    across restaurant locations. Appending the review with “the food was” and seeing
    whether “terrible” or “great” are a more likely continuation suddenly provides
    you with a topical sentiment model. Given the negative sentiment associated with
    “undercooked,” our missing word would almost certainly be “terrible.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Training such a model from scratch would require extensive annotations, but
    with no or just a small number of examples, a workable solution can be found,
    making prompting a viable choice for smaller-scale projects and budgets. Because
    the prompt language can easily be changed, you can explore many possible taxonomies
    and functionality across your dataset without having to commit to a final set
    of guidelines for your annotators.

    different AI and ML disciplines. This has become possible now that less background
    knowledge is required to get your feet wet in the field – and instead of highly
    niche specialists, we’re starting to see solid generalists. This has fostered
    a convergence of modalities, and we’re now seeing traditional text-based approaches
    brought to the numerical world and traditionally NLP-oriented things like transformer
    networks being applied to video and even physical simulations.

    Samsung is combining NLP with video imagery to help self-driving cars interpret
    street signs in foreign countries. NLP and computer vision [are natural bedfellows](https://medium.com/sciforce/nlp-and-computer-vision-integrated-843558143e01),
    and I also expect to see the two being used to help translate video to text for
    accessibility purposes, to improve descriptions of medical imagery, and even to
    translate verbal design requests into a written or visual description.'

    is good for innovation, providing valuable feedback loops, opportunities to improve
    and develop technologies, and giving technologists room to grow. The big guns
    like DeepMind have paved the way with the research papers and libraries left in
    the wake of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, and now smaller contenders such as [HuggingFace](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/)
    are doing the same with a commercial/open-source hybrid developed in tandem with
    language researchers. Partnerships like these, and our own with UMass, mean that
    the NLP community has increased [access to datasets](https://github.com/huggingface),
    tokenizers, and transformers, giving us more insight into what’s going on under
    the hood and fostering opportunities for the community to iterate, advance upon,
    and broaden access to the technology – and strengthening our collective skill
    sets and knowledge.

- en: Algorithms and humans each have their strengths, and by working together, they
    can deliver exceptional results. One area that’s seen some interest is generative
    language, but the problem there is that while algorithms can create output that
    sounds human-like, they’re not concerned with veracity. But having a human at
    hand to monitor for accuracy, relevance, and the rest of Grice’s Maxims can improve
    outcomes. The same partnership works well in summarization, which is an area I’m
    interested in. Quickly condensing a long article into the most salient points
    is surprisingly tricky for humans, and a task machines have shown a reasonable
    capacity for, within some constraints. On the other hand, when we ask machines
    to turn those salient points into a coherent summary, they have an unfortunate
    tendency to change the meaning to something non-factual. But having a machine
    highlight the key ideas in a document, and a human turn that into a short snippet,
    outperforms either working alone. I think we’ll be seeing more and more of this
    as AI and NLP become embedded in everyday work processes.

- en: BERT and other comparable, well-known technologies are built using [transformers](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-89034557de14),
    a type of model that identifies dependencies (words in a sentence that relate
    back to a target word) across long blocks of text. Transformers are highly effective
    – but also incredibly resource-intensive as they require a huge amount of pretraining
    and data. Although the world has been taken by storm by these transformer-based
    technologies, we’re starting to see alternatives spring up as smaller companies
    and teams seek out more viable solutions for smaller-scale (and budget) problems.
    HuggingFace’s transformer variant, [SRU++ and related work](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/03/reducing-high-cost-training-nlp-models-sru.html),
    the Reformer (an efficient transformer model), and models like ETC/BigBird are
    potential alternatives that I expect will see more interest as the computational
    cost of transformer-based projects becomes untenable.

    ebbs and flows as resource-rich industry races ahead with the next big thing while
    research takes some time to catch up and build out our knowledge. This cycle,
    now enriched by the increasingly open-source nature of NLP along with technical
    cross-pollination and new industry applications, will continue to surface new
    opportunities and advancements for us to explore and take advantage of.
