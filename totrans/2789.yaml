- en: In machine learning, hot topics such as autonomous vehicles, GANs, and face
    recognition often take up most of the media spotlight. However, another equally
    important issue that data scientists are working to solve is anomaly detection.
    From network security to financial fraud, anomaly detection helps protect businesses,
    individuals, and online communities. To help improve anomaly detection, researchers
    have developed a new approach called MIDAS.

- en: At the National University of Singapore, PhD candidate [Siddharth Bhatia](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sbhatia/) and
    his team have developed MIDAS, a new approach to anomaly detection that outperforms
    baseline approaches both in speed and accuracy.

    the name suggests, MIDAS detects microcluster anomalies or sudden groups of suspiciously
    similar edges in graphs. One of the main benefits of MIDAS is its ability to detect
    these anomalies in real time, at a speed many times greater than existing state-of-the-art
    models.

- en: Put simply, anomaly detection is the practice of finding patterns or outliers
    that deviate from what you expect to see in a dataset. It can help us find and
    eliminate harmful content. “Anomaly detection in graphs is a critical problem
    for finding suspicious behavior in countless systems,” says Siddharth. “Some of
    these systems include intrusion detection, fake ratings, and financial fraud.”

    profiles used for spam and phishing. It can even be used to help investigators
    identify online sexual predators. “Using MIDAS, we can find anomalous edges and
    nodes in a dynamic (time-evolving) graph,” says Siddharth. “In Twitter and Facebook,
    tweet and message networks can be considered a time-evolving graph and we can
    find the malicious messages and fake profiles by finding the anomalous edges and
    nodes in these graphs.”

    approaches focusing on static graphs,” says Siddharth. “However, many real-world
    graphs are dynamic in nature, and methods based on static connections may miss
    temporal characteristics of the graphs and anomalies.”

    of edges, we need an algorithm which uses constant memory in graph size,” Siddharth
    explains. “Moreover, fraudulent or anomalous events in many applications occur
    in microclusters or suddenly arriving groups of suspiciously similar edges, e.g.
    denial of service attacks in network traffic data and lockstep behavior.”
