    idea to lay out what exactly we're trying to do and why.

    to increase the number of goods you order through their site, so they predict
    which ones you might want to buy next and when. Twitter wants to boost your use
    of their platform, so they predict which tweets you will ignore and which you
    will engage with. Facebook and Google want to increase the number of ads you click
    on their sites, so they predict your personal click-through behavior. They have
    gotten very good at making these predictions.

    to increase the number of students graduating high school. Health workers want
    to improve the overall health of a population at a sustainable cost. Microlenders
    want to give more individuals in the developing world a chance to pursue their
    dreams without incurring default. Conservationists want to curb our energy usage
    without hampering productivity. Governments want to prevent fires from destroying
    lives and property.

- en: This is where we come in. In the quest to make these difficult but important
    changes, we must arm ourselves with state-of-the-art predictions. Predict which
    students are likely to drop out before graduation back when they are in junior
    high, so teachers can intervene earlier. Predict which individuals will be able
    to repay their microloans, even when banks have shut them out in the past. [Predict
    where fires are more likely to break out](http://e-pluribusunum.com/2013/05/20/new-york-city-predictive-data-analytics-fire/),
    and get there first.

    else are data scientists. They are the modern day fortune tellers, but instead
    of crystal balls they wield datasets. Armed with skills in statistics and computer
    science, the data scientist takes large data sets and builds smart, creative,
    flexible models for what is likely to happen next. In 2011, there was more data
    produced than in all the previous years of human history combined. The quantity
    and variety of data available to us is exploding, and the individuals who can
    manipulate and illuminate these data have incredible value to offer.

    crowdsourcing to some of the world''s biggest social challenges and the organizations
    taking them on.** We host online challenges, usually lasting 2-3 months, where
    a global community of data scientists competes to come up with the best statistical
    model for difficult predictive problems that make a difference.'

    than ever before](http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/big_data_for_social_innovation).
    And just like those corporations, they are trying to figure out how to make the
    best use of their data. We work with mission-driven organizations to [identify
    specific predictive questions](http://www.drivendata.org/partners/#problem) that
    they care about answering and can use their data to tackle.

    to come up with [the best solution](http://www.drivendata.org/competitors/#what-makes-a-winning-solution).
    Some competitors are experienced data scientists in the private sector, analyzing
    corporate data by day, saving the world by night, and testing their mettle on
    complex questions of impact. Others are smart, sophisticated students and researchers
    looking to hone their skills on real-world datasets and real-world problems. Still
    more have extensive experience with social sector data and want to bring their
    expertise to bear on new, meaningful challenges - with immediate feedback on how
    well their solution performs.

    combined with the increasing prevalence of large, relevant datasets. Unlike other
    data competition platforms, our primary goal is to create actual, measurable,
    lasting positive change in the world with our competitions. At the end of each
    challenge, we work with the sponsoring organization to integrate the winning solutions,
    giving them the tools to drive real improvements in their impact.
