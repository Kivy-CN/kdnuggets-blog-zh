    on the machine learning algorithm, ids represented as ordinal values may teach
    the model that one category has a greater relevance than the other. For example,
    if Argentina id is 1 and Brazil is 2, an algorithm could infer that Brazil is
    twice as more representative than Argentina. To deal with such issue, it’s common
    to use techniques like [One-Hot Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot)(OHE)
    where each categorical field is transformed into a sparse vector. In the sparse
    vector all positions have zero values, except the one corresponding to the id
    value.

- en: Another popular technique for categorical features with large number of unique
    values is [Feature Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing), which
    maps categories to a fixed length vector using hashing functions. This approach
    provides lower sparsity and higher compression compared to OHE and deals nicely
    with new and rare categorical values (eg. previously unseen user-agents). It also
    may cause some collisions when mapping more than one feature to the same vector
    position, but machine learning algorithms are usually robust enough to deal with
    these conflicts. I used both techniques in my approach.

    numerical scalar features. Some features are very noisy, and we'd better reduce
    the effects of minor observation errors or differences with this transformation.
    For example, I ‘binned’ the event ‘hour’ in periods like morning, midday, afternoon,
    evening, etc., because my hypotheses is that user behavior wouldn’t be too different
    if observed at 10am or 11am, for instance.

    only one page view logged and very few users with high number of views were present.
    Applying transformations like log(1 + #views) was useful to smooth out the distribution.
    A user that has 1,000 page views might not be very different from a user with
    500 views, they both are equally outliers in this context.'
