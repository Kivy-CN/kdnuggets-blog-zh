- en: Despite having never left, [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) is back with the
    latest version of their (**free!**) flagship course, [Practical Deep Learning
    for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/).

- en: If you have been around the machine learning space for any length of time, you
    are undoubtedly already familiar with fast.ai, their courses, their book, their
    software, their founders, or some subset of these. But just in case you aren't,
    what is Practical Deep Learning for Coders?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A free course designed for people with some coding experience, who want to learn
    how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems.

- en: 'Previous iterations of the course have been taken by hundred of thousands of
    students form around the world. This latest iteration is a completely-rewritten
    version of the course, which has been in the works for two years. If that''s the
    case, you would think that there must be a lot of updates and differences from
    the previous implementations... and there are! Here are a few highlights:'

- en: A much bigger focus on interactive explorations. Students in the course build
    simple GUIs for building decision trees, linear classifiers, and non-linear models
    by hand, using that experience to develop a deep intuitive understanding of how
    foundational algorithms work

    and entrepreneur Jeremy Howard, for the company co-founded by he and the equally
    celebrated Rachel Thomas. These aren't newcomers to the scene trying to cobble
    together a course on something they just learned; this is the culmination of years
    of understanding, distilled into nine 90 minute lessons. Oh, and did I mentioned
    that it's **free**?

    some of the most recent and currently relevant libraries (PyTorch, Hugging Face,
    and fastai) to the beyond (deploying models).

    on the course site include: how to train state of the art computer vision, NLP,
    tabular, and collaborative filtering models; how to deploy your trained models
    as web apps; an in-depth understanding of deep learning (pun intended), which
    can be used to build and improve your own models; practical techniques that actually
    matter.'

- en: Don't let the opportunity to learn practical, relevant machine learning from
    an expert — in every sense of the word — pass you by. The course is brand new,
    as up to date as is possible, and covers topics that will help you excel in implementing
    your own machine learning and deep learning models.
