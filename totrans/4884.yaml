- en: Like many of you, I have been very excited by Google's Colaboratory project.
    While it isn't exactly new, its recent public release has generated a lot of renewed
    interest in the collaborative platform.

    you play around with it. To be clear, these aren't hidden hacks, but a handy collection
    of documented (and further clarified) functionality that may be essential.

    ensure that you are connected to the runtime (there is a green check next to "connected"
    in the menu ribbon).

- en: Currently, software installations within Google Colaboratory are not persistent,
    in that you must reinstall libraries every time you (re-)connect to an instance.
    Since Colab has numerous useful common libraries installed by default, this is
    less of an issue than it may seem, and installing those libraries which are not
    pre-installed are easily added in one of a few different ways.
  prefs: []

- en: You will want to be aware, however, that installing any software which needs
    to be built from source may take longer than is feasible when connecting/reconnecting
    to your instance.

    you are using, remember to prepend any bash commands with a !.

    like `wget` to grab data from the web, but what if you have some local files you
    want to upload to your Colab environment within your Google Drive and use them?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Jupyter notebooks, but with less setup and administration. That's the idea, anyways;
    we'll see how it plays out.
