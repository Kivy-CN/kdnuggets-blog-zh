    you remember **Watson** that defeated two of Jeopardy’s greatest champions in
    2011? It was the first cognitive system which used natural language processing
    and machine learning to change the way people interact with computing systems.
    Now it has been more widely applied.'

    to. Watson was trained to help physicians identify treatment options for cancer
    patients, to provide approval suggestions to nursing staff, and uncover key information
    from patients’ medical records.'

    Medical Assistant powered by IBM Watson to increase physicians’ efficiency. They
    can not only view past diagnoses and patient files, but also ask questions like
    “how does methotrexate compare to cyclosporine” as shown in the left screenshot.
    The most awesome part is that EMA will learn each physician’s unique practice
    style.  Although I do not know how well it works, this a step closer to future
    healthcare.

    us in a more natural and personalized way. These systems will get smarter and
    more customized through interactions with data, devices and people.

    textbook, tailored curriculum and robot tutor may become parts of students’ life
    in the near future. CEO of Majestyk Apps, the winner of [IBM Watson Mobile Developers
    Challenge](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/challenge.html), presented
    their cognitive toy, Fang.'

    world. It is not hard to imagine cognitive smart textbook, newspaper, or desk.

    with the help of Big Data. Imagine an App which recommends clothes in different
    situations, helps us decide which dress to buy and enables us to try on clothes
    without getting undressed. (I cannot wait to install it.) Another idea is the
    combination of online and offline shopping. In this way, we can enjoy the exciting
    shopping experience and also convenience of quick checkout.'

- en: What IBM has done is that it invested in a digital shopping company, [Fluid](http://www.fluid.com)
    and applied the cognitive power of Watson to e-commerce. In this way, instead
    of searching keyword, people ask specific questions. Sounds like you have a sales
    representative everyday.

    inferences about our activities and alert whenever abnormal things happen. For
    example, if the guardian detects a purchase of gas, it will “think” the purchase
    as a highly suspicious one because your car has just re-fueled or you are in the
    office when this happens.'

    to predict what you need? Everyone can share his information like a broken street
    light, traffic  jams via mobile app, and it will generate the most suitable solution
    to your request based on all the information. Also, sentiment analysis will help
    city governors with city planing. More machine learning applications can be developed
    related to city life, like crime prediction, bus routes, street sweeping, automatic
    air conditioning, etc.'
