    everything we do. From smartphones farming our information, to websites scraping
    where we frequent for advertising angles, to social media on all levels, our digital

    continues to accelerate at an exponential rate, so does the rate at which data
    is collected. Think about the drastic differences taking place in regards to electronic
    payment for example. Due to NFC chips in payment cards and phones the rapid access
    to buying things only continues to expand. What used to take minutes, now only
    takes seconds.

    disagreed with ethics training and 7% were unsure.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If companies want to protect their users and data they need to be sure to only
    collect what’s truly necessary. An abundance of data doesn’t necessarily mean
    that there is an abundance of useable data. Keeping data collection concise and
    deliberate is key. Relevant data must be held in high regard in order to protect
    privacy.
  prefs: []

    instill transparency. Algorithms are currently being used for everything from
    [machine thinking](/2016/06/ethics-machine-learning-mlconf.html) and autonomous
    cars, to data science and predictive analytics. The algorithms used for data collection
    allow companies to see very specific patterns and behavior in consumers all while
    keeping their identities safe.

    some form of information is collected about your trip to the store. A few years
    ago, the retail giant Target broke through the typical levels of customer-based

    again.

    a picture of big data that must include an immense attention to detail.
