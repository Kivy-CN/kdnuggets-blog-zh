    analytics, big data, modeling, prediction, machine learning, algorithms, data
    mining techniques, rules, computational complexity, latency, data products, data
    engineering, statistical inference, R programming, data wrangling, data hacking,
    statistical modeling, supervised / unsupervised learning, data visualization,
    unstructured data and many other subjects that make the world of Data Science.
    Someone said that the term itself is an umbrella term. There are many books out
    there which would deal with great detail on some of the topics mentioned above,
    written by their respective masters.

    would be different and profoundly impact me.  I must confess that, my understanding
    of this beautiful art/science of drawing insights from data has gone up to a whole
    new level.

- en: The book has many versions of definitions of data science like the one from
    Josh Wills and the conversations carry on from there and the transitions they
    make from their rich academic backgrounds to the real world where they hone their
    skills practicing the craft of seducing the information, insights, and the signal
     out from  complex, unyielding and noisy datasets and creating data products that
    can capture data from a captive audience and in the process building rich data
    sources for further analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is from these conversations that my understanding of this science has deepened
    with my longing to continue to pursue the craft still enhanced. Every artiste
    in this book has got his/her own view on the definition of data science but broadly
    speaking they seem to agree on the convergence of the  fields of Math/Statistics,
    computer science and domain expertise.

    skills required for practicing data science. Making a transition from a purely
    academic background to the real world of business. Organizations like **Insight
    Data science founded by Jake Klamka** is specifically designed for helping PhD’s
    transition into industry. At the other end of the spectrum, aspiring data scientists,
    who have enough domain expertise and are keen to pursue this art can take umbrage
    from the example of **Clare Corthell** who has embarked on a self crafted journey
    to embrace the art of data science purely on online learning MOOCs. In Fact she
    has herself come out with a curriculum for data science with the Open Source Data
    Science Masters (OSDSM) program. These courses can help you to bridge the gap
    in your learning and practicing the craft.

    buy that argument at all, I think it’s false because it assumes linear serial
