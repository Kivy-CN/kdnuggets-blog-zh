- en: Python is a flexible, open source, interpreted, high level programming language,
    which is appropriate for use in a variety of real world settings. At some point,
    likely in part due to its simple syntax and amenability to fast prototyping, Python
    became [the language of data science](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-for-data-science/).

    not **the** most popular programming language — in the world, as evidenced by
    the fact that the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) for June 2022
    ranks Python #1.'

    Contributing factors to its continued widespread adoption as the language of choice
    for implementing projects include its massive ecosystem, its flexibility and performance,
    the fact that it is a force multiplier ("[Python does let you hammer something
    out really quickly](https://www.datanami.com/2021/10/20/whats-driving-pythons-massive-popularity/)"),

- en: For a majority of data science and machine learning positions out there, not
    knowing Python is a major hurdle to gaining employment, regardless of your other
    qualifications. That's why you should learn Python now —if you don't already know
    it — or solidify your Python knowledge if you are already familiar with the basics.

- en: As you can see, the course goes from installation and the basics all the way
    through to building a project, hitting the major aspects of the language along
    the way. Aside from learning Python's linguist constructs and syntax, like its
    basic types, control statements, and dealing with exceptions, you also gain exposure
    to somewhat ancillary, but no less important, concepts such as Git and virtual
    environments.
