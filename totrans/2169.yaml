- en: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are key to building intelligent models that
    learn from data to solve a particular task, namely making predictions, classifications,
    detecting anomalies, and more. Optimizing ML models entails adjusting the data
    and the algorithms that lead to building such models, to achieve more accurate
    and efficient results, and improving their performance against new or unexpected
    situations.

    of ML algorithms, more specifically, optimizing the accuracy or predictive power
    of the resulting ML models built. Let's have a look.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Before training an ML model, it is very important to preprocess the data used
    to train it: clean the data, remove outliers, deal with missing values, and scale
    numerical variables when needed. These steps often help enhance the quality of
    the data, and high-quality data is often synonymous with high-quality ML models
    trained upon them.'

- en: Besides, not all the features in your data might be relevant to the model built.
    Feature selection techniques help identify the most relevant attributes that will
    influence the model results. Using only those relevant features may help not only
    reduce your model's complexity but also improve its performance.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Unlike ML model parameters which are learned during the training process, hyperparameters
    are settings selected by us before training the model, just like buttons or gears
    in a control panel that may be manually adjusted. Adequately tuning hyperparameters
    by finding a configuration that maximizes the model performance on test data can
    significantly impact the model performance: try experimenting with different combinations
    to find an optimal setting.'

- en: 3\. Cross-Validation
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Implementing cross-validation is a clever way to increase your ML models' robustness
    and ability to generalize to new unseen data once it is deployed for real-world
    use. Cross-validation consists of partitioning the data into multiple subsets
    or folds and using different training/testing combinations upon those folds to
    test the model under different circumstances and consequently get a more reliable
    picture of its performance. It also reduces the risks of overfitting, a common
    problem in ML whereby your model has "memorized" the training data rather than
    learning from it, hence it struggles to generalize when it is exposed to new data
    that looks even slightly different than the instances it memorized.

- en: 4\. Regularization Techniques
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Continuing with the overfitting problem sometimes is caused by having built
    an exceedingly complex ML model. Decision tree models are a clear example where
    this phenomenon is easy to spot: an overgrown decision tree with tens of depth
    levels might be more prone to overfitting than a simpler tree with a smaller depth.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regularization is a very common strategy to overcome the overfitting problem
    and thus make your ML models more generalizable to any real data. It adapts the
    training algorithm itself by adjusting the loss function used to learn from errors
    during training, so that "simpler routes" towards the final trained model are
    encouraged, and "more sophisticated" ones are penalized.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Unity makes strength: this historical motto is the principle behind ensemble
    techniques, consisting of combining multiple ML models through strategies such
    as bagging, boosting, or stacking, capable of significantly boosting your solutions''
    performance compared to that of a single model. Random Forests and XGBoost are
    common ensemble-based techniques known to perform comparably to deep learning
    models for many predictive problems. By leveraging the strengths of individual
    models, ensembles can be the key to building a more accurate and robust predictive
    system.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Optimizing ML algorithms is perhaps the most important step in building accurate
    and efficient models. By focusing on data preparation, hyperparameter tuning,
    cross-validation, regularization, and ensemble methods, data scientists can significantly
    enhance their models' performance and generalizability. Give these techniques
    a try, not only to improve predictive power but also help create more robust solutions
    capable of handling real-world challenges.
