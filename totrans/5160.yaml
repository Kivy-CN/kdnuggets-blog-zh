    first. MySQL uses InnoDB as its storage engine, and the *Repeatable Read* isolation
    level, which sees data before a transaction begins, is the most common.

    in InnoDB is unable to handle certain issues smoothly. Namely, problems such as
    lost updates and phantom reads can't be handled at the InnoDB *Repeatable Read*
    isolation level, whereas you don't need additional hacks to solve lost updates
    in PostgreSQL. There are, however, a few tricks you can use to perform phantom
    reads like range types and other mechanisms.

    appropriately to avoid issues like lost updates and phantom reads. This article
    will cover how [MySQL developers](/2022/01/developers-python-machine-learning-projects.html)
    can troubleshoot the "write" skew that phantom reads can cause.

- en: There are different scenarios that can lead to phantom reads. Generally speaking,
    however, these scenarios all follow a similar pattern. They initially will search
    a specific range in a MySQL database and then CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE depending
    on the results of the range that has been searched. Afterward, the executed operation
    directly impacts the results taken from the range that's been searched.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's assume, for example, that the action taken after a specific range has
    been searched is an UPDATE or DELETE. In this case, MySQL developers can use an
    exclusive lock to avoid a "write" skew. Developers may then use a FOR UPDATE at
    the start of their SELECT, after which they can force two simultaneous transactions
    to follow one after the other. Therefore, these two simultaneous transactions,
    during the [race condition](/2020/05/complex-logic-breakneck-speed-julia-data-science.html),
    circumvent a "write" skew.

- en: 'If we''re assuming that the action taken according to a specific range''s search
    results is CREATE, though, the above solution is incomplete: no corresponding
    row exists that allows a developer to lock in SELECT, which means a row is formed
    later on.'

    reserved a room using this system, new data is added to a table. This system lets
    users know that a room is available for use depending on the time slot they want
    to reserve it for. Once someone creates a new reservation entry, all other users
    can avoid time conflicts.
  id: totrans-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Issues arise, however, when two people need to reserve a room at the same time
    concurrently. Both users are able to get past the initial SELECT validation, which
    means that on paper, they both have a reservation for the same time, resulting
    in a time conflict. This issue can be compounded if, for instance, there are multiple
    users [with a VPN connection](https://thebestvpn.com/reviews/surfshark/) to a
    remote SQL server who need to use this reservation system. This issue isn't avoidable
    even if a MySQL developer adds an exclusive lock since they can't lock a row at
    the starting SELECT validation.

- en: MySQL developers cannot turn a concurrent operation into one that is sequential
    by using exclusive locks. Therefore, they'll need to let one operation fail by
    adding unique constraints to their table.
  id: totrans-22

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers can target the room reservation table's columns corresponding to
    room numbers and meeting start times with unique constraint indexes. This solution
    prevents someone from reserving a time slot that someone else has already reserved,
    and developers can make it so no one can reserve a room for more than one hour.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this solution also prevents a unique constraint from being effective
    if two users have meetings with overlapping times. To correctly solve the issue,
    developers must instead materialize conflicts.

- en: The correct way to solve the phantom reads we're discussing is by uncovering
    conflicts that a table hides. Developers can pre-fill a brand new table with [sets
    of data](/2021/09/springboard-unique-data-sets-data-science-skills.html) that
    coordinate concurrent operations. If we use our meeting room system as an example,
    we can imagine creating a new table that dictates time slots and displays all
    available slots of time in advance.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this new table, developers would now execute a SELECT on the column that
    dictates available time slots and include a FOR UPDATE since the data already
    exists. Developers would need to run this SELECT FOR UPDATE before the initial
    SELECT.
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By materializing conflicts in the above example, developers can block any two
    reserved slots of time that overlap with each other with an exclusive lock, therefore
    forcing one time slot to come before or after the other. Whichever slot of time
    comes later immediately fails due to the completion of the first time slot.

- en: Although materializing conflicts is a tough and unintuitive solution to pull
    off, it's necessary to avoid sacrificing any significant level of performance
    when using a MySQL database. MySQL's InnoDB isolation level is unfortunately not
    serializable, so developers need to sacrifice some level of complexity for acceptable
    performance levels.

    as well as its hard-to-solve solutions. Otherwise, it would be impossible to anticipate
    which behaviors of that database may potentially compromise database design and
    development efforts.

    important. While the use case we've described in this article via our time reservation
    system isn't identical to other use cases, the patterns it exhibits are similar
    enough that understanding how to solve them can make handling other situations
    easier down the road.
