    (AI) – is taking over all kinds of industries and business domains. This includes
    retail, healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, and more. With this wider
    adoption across all kinds of operations and by a workforce with a diverse set
    of skills, learning how to work with machine learning is becoming increasingly
    important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to this expansion of ML usage by the **ever-increasing cross-section of
    employees in an organization**, it has become critical to develop systems that
    can be used by business professionals of all sorts of backgrounds. And that means
    these systems **cannot exclusively be coding or programming oriented** like the
    ones used by software engineers or data scientists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**This is where the AutoML systems enter the picture.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, AutoML enables **developers with limited ML expertise** (and coding
    experience) to train high-quality models specific to their **business needs**.
    There are other aspects of AutoML from an academic research point of view (i.e.
    searching for the best ML algorithms for given data types and proving theoretical
    properties about such systems); but for this article, we will focus on AutoML
    systems which cater to everyday business and technology applications.

    by an AutoML system may not be as performant or optimized as compared to the one
    architected by an expert ML engineer (using hand-crafted feature engineering or
    deep learning tuning).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this kind of hand-tuning is often a time-consuming process and, for
    most situations, getting to a production-ready status with a decent ML model in
    a relatively shorter amount of time is much more critical for an organization
    than wasting time on producing the absolute best performing model. AutoML systems
    help organizations achieve this critical business objective, hence its growing popularity
    and wider adoption.

    their workforce, install the tools like AutoML to quickly spin up a working machine
    learning based system, and move forward with the next steps in AI-ready production

    package built on scikit-learn. Auto-Sklearn frees a data scientist from the task
    of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning. Essentially, it automatically
    searches for the right learning algorithm for a new machine learning dataset and
    optimizes its hyperparameters.
  prefs: []

- en: It extends the idea of configuring a general machine learning framework with
    efficient global optimization which was introduced with [Auto-WEKA](http://www.automl.org/automl/autoweka/).
    To improve generalization, Auto-Sklearn builds an **ensemble of all models** tested
    during the global optimization process. In order to speed up the optimization
    process, Auto-Sklearn uses **meta-learning** to identify similar datasets and
    use the **knowledge gathered in the past**.

    digital feature standardization, and principal component analysis (PCA). At its
    core, the library uses scikit-learn estimators to process classification and regression
    problems.
