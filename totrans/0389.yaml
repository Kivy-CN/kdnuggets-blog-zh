- en: You’ve been working in the data science industry for a few years now, and you
    are ready to move beyond an entry-level position. The only problem is you are
    not sure how. How do you land a senior data scientist position?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this blog, we are going to answer that question. If you would rather get
    this information in a video, I also have a[ video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOaoG9UZT1c)on
    the subject on my YouTube channel. Both discuss the base requirements many companies
    use to determine junior versus senior data scientists and then move on to how
    you can make yourself stand out in an interview as someone qualified for a senior
    position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we dive into this though, I want to put out a small disclaimer. I was
    not a senior data scientist. When I worked at my previous company, Airbnb, I transitioned
    from data science to software engineering, so I was never in a senior data scientist
    position. However, I have gained knowledge about what differentiates junior and
    senior data scientists from my colleagues by interviewing senior data scientists.

- en: First of all, when it comes to interviewing for senior versus entry-level positions
    the process may not look too different. In many companies, the interview process
    is the same for entry-level and senior data scientist positions. There are technical
    rounds, such as statistics, SQL, and coding, and non-technical rounds, such as
    behavioral interviews. I consider interviews like product case interviews or presentations
    as a combination of technical and non-technical skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the interview process is the same, how does a company determine whether you
    are a senior or mid-level? Truthfully companies typically have a standard already
    in place. While there are outliers, you cannot fake your experience.

- en: '**To land a senior position often requires around 4 to 5 years of experience
    if you have a Master’s degree, or 2 to 3 years of experience if you have a Ph.D.** That
    is to say, it may require more than 5 years of experience if you have a bachelor’s
    degree.'

    there is nothing you can do to influence your placement and position in a company**.
    I know people who did great in the interview and landed a senior position, even
    though they only had less than 2 years of experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also a flip side to this. I know people who did not do well in the
    interviews and were offered positions that were lower than their experience might
    dictate. Your experience matters, and so does how you present yourself in the
    interview.

- en: The product case interview is one of the first areas in which you have a chance
    to display skills that could lead to a more senior position. A product case interview
    is all about your problem-solving skills. While both a senior and entry-level
    data scientist need to be able to **solve problems**, someone who deserves a senior
    position has** solutions that stand out.**
  prefs: []

    demonstrate a higher level of problem-solving skills that could help you land
    a senior position.
  prefs: []

- en: Show Awareness of Context
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first way is to **consider the specific context of the problem **rather
    than following a framework rigidly. When I say specific context, it includes the
    business model, the stage of the company, and the unique aspects of a product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyone can memorize a framework and follow it to come up with an answer. Doing
    that will not prove you have the experience and ability that deserves a more senior
    position. In fact, if you start with a framework right away after getting a question,
    it may sound a bit too reactive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, some people consider the natural next step to evaluate any hypothesis
    is to use a/b testing. However, there are cases when doing an a/b testing is not
    feasible, such as resource constraints or the requirement of a/b testing is not
    met.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine that you are asked to select a few ideas among many ideas for an early-stage
    e-commerce business. We won’t simply a/b test every single idea because it will
    be costly and time-consuming, more importantly, it’s not necessary. If we have
    data on users’ preferences, browsing behaviors, and purchase histories, we could
    gain lots of insights by looking at the data and seeing which part has the most
    demand and opportunity.
  prefs: []

- en: Another example is diagnosing a problem with Robinhood where the trade activity
    is decreasing. You might follow a framework to go over factors such as seasonality,
    external events, and user segment. However, if you don’t take the time to clarify
    things like how much is the change, what kind of activity is decreasing, is it
    stock or crypto, etc., it becomes clear that you are following a framework without
    considering the specific context of the exact problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that frameworks are generic, while problems are specific. You want
    to show awareness and understanding of the product itself and the goal of the
    company. Frameworks are a useful tool, but you also want to **demonstrate your
    capability for individual thinking **and coming up with specific solutions.

    Many candidates would immediately jump into their methods and the data they would
    use to achieve this. However, a more experienced candidate might first ask things
    like “Why do we need it?” and “Do we only need the month and date or do we also
    need the year information?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An experienced candidate recognizes that there might be privacy issues here
    that should be taken into account when determining a solution. If you want a senior
    position, you need to show not only an ability to work with the data but also **a
    competence for understanding potential problems and obstacles.**

    interview. What is strategic thinking? To put it simply, it’s** the ability to
    think beyond numbers**. When running an experiment the result is important. However,
    there are many things that need to be considered at the same time.

    The experiment showed that the program will lose money in the short term. That
    might make it seem like the program is a bad idea, but the program might still
    have strategic benefits. Acquiring more drivers results in a better supply to
    serve the demand, also newly acquired drivers may refer more drivers to the platform.
    Both may eventually increase Uber’s market share and help keep its competitive
    advantage.

    an ability to think strategically about the problems at hand.

    differentiate yourself in the behavioral interview. The behavioral interview is
    where you will discuss your past experience, and, as we mentioned in the introduction,

    difference.

    about your past, and each question will typically focus on a particular attribute.
    You will be asked things like “Describe a time you dealt with a conflict” or “Tell
    me about a time you had to work under a strict deadline”. These questions are
    looking to examine your conflict resolution and time management skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that the question is obviously asking about.** Display multiple dimensions of
    yourself with each answer.** Remember that you are not only answering the question
    but also presenting yourself as a professional and a person.

    would make you a good choice for a higher position. Some positive attributes include
    leadership, responsibility for the team, and the ability to thrive in ambiguity.
    Fine-tune your stories to show that you are willing to go above and beyond, care
    about the overall team success, and can drive and deliver impact.

    tell an interviewer much about your experience.

    instead of an easy project that is 100% successful. By **presenting on a project

    is a strong indicator of experience.
