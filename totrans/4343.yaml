- en: At KDnuggets, we have brought a number of free eBooks to our readers this past
    year. Among other articles highlighting such materials, I have written a series
    of posts since the pandemic erupted, in the case that more people spending more
    time at home may result in more time for reading. Of course, a packed reading
    schedule is obviously not what the past nine months has had in store for everyone,
    but for those who could spare a moment here or there, we hope that some of the
    eBooks we have shared during this tough time may have been useful.

    to close out the year by compiling a list of 15 in a single place. If you originally
    missed out on a few or all of them in totality, this is your chance to catch up
    on some reading.

    have done their best to condense what they see as the most important fundamental
    aspects into ~300 pages of text. With few accessible books dedicated to the subject,
    this one may be your go-to choice if you are interested in building your own conceptual
    foundation.

    such as statistical inference, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, linear

  id: totrans-24

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many contemporary books, data science has been reduced to a series of programming
    tools which, if mastered, promise to do the data science for you. There seems
    to be less emphasis on the underlying concepts and theory divorced from code.
    This book is a good example of the opposite to this trend, a book which will undoubtedly
    arm you with the theoretical knowledge necessary to approach a career in data
    science with a strong set of foundations.

    treatments of topics from bias-variance trade-off to linear regression to model
    validation strategies to model boosting to kernel methods to prediction problems
    and beyond. And the benefit of such a thorough treatment is that your understanding
    will go deeper than just grasping the abstract intuition.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts off slow — describing NLP, how Python can be used to perform
    some NLP programming tasks, how to access natural language content to process
    — and moves on to bigger concepts, both conceptually (NLP) programmatically (Python).
    Soon it gets to categorization, text classification, information extraction, and
    other topics more often thought of as classic NLP. After getting the basics of
    NLP with this book, you can move on to more modern and cutting edge techniques,
    perhaps through the use of materials such as some of Stanford's free courses.

    a PhD**, by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger'
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is unusual in that it's taught "top down". We teach almost everything
    through real examples. As we build out those examples, we go deeper and deeper,
    and we'll show you how to make your projects better and better. This means that
    you'll be gradually learning all the theoretical foundations you need, in context,
    in such a way that you'll see why it matters and how it works. We've spent years
    building tools and teaching methods that make previously complex topics very simple.

    many others have also found Python for Everybody useful. The consensus seems to
    be that the book quickly covers concepts, does so in an easily understandable
    manner, and jumps right into the corresponding code.

- en: If you have little to no understanding of what automated machine learning is
    in practice, don't worry. The book starts off with a solid introduction to the
    topic, and lays out explicitly what you can expect chapter by chapter, which is
    important in a book comprised of independent separate chapters. After this, in
    first section of the book, you get right in to reading about the important topics
    of contemporary AutoML, and be confident of this since the book was put together
    in 2019\. The next section is a walkthrough of a half dozen tools for implementing
    these AutoML concepts. The last section is an analysis of the AutoML Challenge
    Series that existed for a few years during 2015 to 2018, the time that interest
    in automated approaches to machine learning seemed to explode.

  id: totrans-39
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What makes Dive into Deep Learning (D2K) unique is that we went so far with
    the idea of *learning by doing* that the entire book itself consists of runnable
    code. We tried to combine the best aspects of a textbook (clarity and math) with
    the best aspects of hands-on tutorials (practical skills, reference code, implementation
    tricks, and intuition). Each chapter section teaches a single key idea through
    multiple modalities, interweaving prose, math, and a self-contained implementation
    that can easily be grabbed and modified to give your projects a running start.
    We think this approach is essential for teaching deep learning because so much
    of the core knowledge in deep learning is derived from experimentation (vs. first
    principles).

- en: The first part of the book covers pure mathematical concepts, without getting
    into machine learning at all. The second part turns its attention to applying
    these newfound maths skills to machine learning problems. Depending on your desires,
    you could take either a top-down or bottom-up approach to leanring both machine
    learning and its underlying maths, or pick one part the other on which to focus.

  id: totrans-44
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All this is to say that the authors, who are also researchers and instructors,
    have an approach to how they are conveying their expertise. Their method seems
    to follow a logical ordered approach to what, and when, readers should be learning.
    However, individual chapters stand on their own as well, and so picking up the
    book and heading straight to the chapter on model inferences, for example, will
    work perfectly well, so long as you already have an understanding of what comes
    in the book before it.

  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R (ISLR) can be
    considered a less advanced treatment of the topics found in another classic of
    the genre written by some of the same authors, The Elements of Statistical Learning.
    Another major difference between these 2 titles, beyond the level of depth of
    the material covered, is that ISLR introduces these topics alongside practical
    implementations in a programming language, in this case R.
