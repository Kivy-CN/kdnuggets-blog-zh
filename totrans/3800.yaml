    came with surprises - a lot has changed in a year. You must think JavaScript or
    Python would be at the top, but the rankings are based on demand, not popularity.
    Companies are willing to pay more for niche languages, and today we're going to
    learn all about them.

    for niche programming languages is on the rise, which is reflected in their high
    pay scales. While JavaScript and Python remain popular, companies are willing
    to invest more in developers who specialize in less mainstream languages. As a
    result, it's worth considering expanding your skill set to include one of the
    five highest-paid languages of the year, which include Zig, Erlang, F#, Clojure,
    and Ruby.
