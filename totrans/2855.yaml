- en: For those getting started with neural networks, autoencoders can look and sound
    intimidating.  But in fact, they are a conceptually simple and elegant approach
    that will open many doors to an ML practitioner.  They can be used for anomaly
    detection and missing value imputation or help in building better classifiers
    or clusters.  In any case, what makes them unique is that they provide you with
    a mechanism for leveraging your unlabelled data, which often is much easier to
    get than labeled data.  For instance, it's a lot easier to get a collection of
    images than it is to get a collection of images where each one is labeled to tell
    you what's in it.

- en: First and foremost, autoencoders are trained via *unsupervised* learning, which
    means you don't need labels.  An autoencoder is learned to *predict its own input*
    by using a noisy version of itself, which forces it to take advantage of structure
    in the data to learn compact ways of representing it.  At a high level, this means
    learning to throw away the noisy details and only keeping the important stuff. 
    Once you have a network that can condense data down to a compact form and discard
    details, that opens up a lot of new doors.
