    – it depends. But either way, this background is clearly more suited to Type B
    data science, which requires a solid grounding in software engineering principles.
    I discussed this with James Petterson who is a Senior Data Scientist at Commonwealth
    Bank of Australia (and previously a software engineer), and here is what he said
    on the matter:'

    of designing robust systems, but simply writing software. A lot of tasks you can
    automate and if you want to run experiments, you have to write code, and if you
    can do it fast, it makes a huge difference. When I did my PhD, I had to run tens
    of thousands of experiments every day, and at this scale, it wasn’t possible to
    do them manually. Having an engineering background meant I could do this with
    speed, whereas a lot of the students from other backgrounds struggled with basic
    software issues: they were really good at mathematics but implementing their ideas
    would take a long time”*'

    a robust implementation of a machine learning algorithm in a production environment.
    It’s all sorts of things – like maintainable code, a shared code base so multiple
    people can work on it, things like logging, being able to debug problems in production,
    scalability – to know that once things ramp up, you’ve architected it in such
    a way so that you can parallise it, or add more CPU, if needed. So if you’re looking
    for the type of roles where you need to get these things into a platform, as opposed
    to doing exploratory research or answering ad-hoc business questions, software
    engineering is so valuable”*'

    with a good disposition for mathematics, you are in a great position to become
    a (Type B) data scientist, providing you are prepared to put in the work to master
    statistics/machine learning,'

    Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that many mathematicians are now plying
    their trade as data scientists. However, there are relatively few coming directly
    from mathematics, and this peculiarity peaked my interest.'

- en: 'One explanation is that there are fewer graduates from mathematics (both pure
    and applied) compared to the other relevant fields of study, but this fails to
    tell the whole story. And so to dig deeper, I turned to Boris Savkovic, Lead Data
    Scientist at BuildingIQ (a start-up that uses advanced algorithms to optimise
    energy use in commercial buildings). Boris has a background in Electrical Engineering
    and Applied Mathematics and having worked with many mathematicians in his time,
    he provided the following insights:'

    and seeing deep meaning in theorems, whereas commercial data science is empirical,
    messy and dirty. While some mathematicians love this, many hate it. The real world
    is complex, you cannot sandbox everything, you have to prioritise, appreciate
    the incentives of others, compromise the math and technology for short-term vs.
    medium-term vs. long-term, worry about diminishing returns (80/20 rule) and deal
    with both deep theory and deep practice, and everything in-between. In short:
    you have to be flexible and adaptable to deal with the real world. And this is
    ultimately what commercial data science is about: finding faster and better practical
    solutions that make money. For those with heavy mathematical/theory backgrounds
    who want to understand everything to the last degree, this can be very difficult,
    and I have seen a number of mathematics PhDs struggle badly when transitioning
    from research/academia to commercial data science”*'

    and he added that he has also worked with many excellent applied mathematicians
    in his career. This seems logical because pure mathematics is likely to attract
    those with a love for the theory, as opposed to real world problems. And theoretical
    work won’t involve much interaction with data, which is – you know – quite important
    for data science.

    not purely what someone has studied. And clearly: a lot of what mathematics graduates
    learn is highly transferable, so picking up the specific statistical/machine learning
    techniques shouldn’t be too difficult (if not already known).'

- en: In terms of suitability, most mathematicians are probably best equipped to learn
    the tools and theory for Type A data science. However, there are mathematicians
    who study computer science (theoretical computer science is essentially a branch
    of mathematics) and so people with this background may be more suited to Type
    B data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is an important lesson to take from all this, and it comes down to understanding
    the reality of what commercial data science involves. If you truly understand
    the challenges and that is what you are seeking, then go for it. But if you have
    a love for the theory more than the practical application, you might want to reassess
    your thinking.
