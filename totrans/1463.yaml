    science education alternatives available via numerous online platforms. So why
    am I feeling it necessary to write about another data science learning resource?

    Days of Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOV96BCAvZc) are out of my system
    — I wanted to first find some concise review material for concepts I have previously
    learned and skills I have already acquired but which may have gone a bit rusty
    on me. To be clear, Kaggle Learn does not bill its micro-courses specifically
    as review material; however, I am so far finding that they fit this requirement
    for me rather well (though, admittedly, I'm still early in the process).

    or less) starting at the top and working through the list in order before setting
    off on new learning adventures.

- en: Kaggle Learn isn't exactly brand spanking new; it launched in January 2018 and
    has seen growth of 1500% since (according to Kaggle Learn). Its short course approach
    to practical data skills, however, seems to set it apart from other resources,
    with courses running in the 3-8 hour range.

    lead, [Dan Becker](https://twitter.com/dan_s_becker), and asked him a few questions.
    He obliged with the below insights into the platform, its content, and its future.

- en: First, we focus more on practical applications instead of academic theory. When
    I was in data science consulting, I worked on projects solving business problems
    for dozens of companies. It's striking how conventional courses focus on so many
    skills that don't matter in practice, while missing many of the things that matter
    most. For example, students might learn to code an algorithm from scratch (which
    no one will ever need you to do again), but you won't learn how to manipulate
    data to get it into mainstream libraries that implement the algorithm.

    hands-on projects can get a hiring manager's attention. So, we make our courses
    really short, so you can get to making projects sooner. Personal projects also
    help you focus on the skills involved in real work. As an another benefit, most
    people enjoy their personal projects, so they find more time to do it... whereas
    conventional courses can get boring and drag on for months.

    doing a new type of data science project.

    courses. The prices for online courses are extremely fair (a small fraction of
    what you'll earn when you get a data science job), and the people creating them
    are putting in a lot of work to make something. But when someone needs to charge
    for their courses, they feel pressure to create longer courses. It would be hard
    to charge hundreds or thousands of dollars for a 4 hour course and then tell the
    user "your better off working on a personal project at this point." Since our
    courses are free, we don't feel this pressure to pack them with anything extra.

- en: '**Dan Becker:** *For someone who prefers longer courses, there are already
    a lot of great options. I''ll steer them to one of the other great online platforms
    recreate than trying to create another version of the same thing. Here''s what
    I''d warn this person though: You are going to start learning a lot faster once
    you get a job in the field, since you''ll be learning on the job rather than just
    in your spare time. And you the greatest asset to getting that job is a portfolio
    of personal projects. So delaying your work on personal projects may delay the
    fastest part of your learning.*'

    course, geospatial analytics course, and a reinforcement learning course. Each
    course will only be about 4 hours long. You won't become an expert in any of these
    fields in that amount of time. But you'll learn enough to work independently,
    find new answers as you need them, and start doing interesting work.

    is so much about Python I don't use regularly — and will hopefully check them
    off the list one by one by the end of the month. Off to new material at that point,
    after shoring up my base.

- en: I encourage anyone looking for short practical data skills courses to have a
    look at Kaggle Learn, whether you are a beginner or more of an intermediate looking
    for a solid set of review materials. While these courses won't make you an expert
    in any area in a few hours — and, indeed, they don't purport to do so — they will
    provide a concise path to practical implementation and a way forward from there.
