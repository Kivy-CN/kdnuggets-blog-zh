    the past 12 months. It was only a little over a year ago that ChatGPT burst onto
    the scene and threw everyone's fears and hopes for AI into a supercharged pressure
    cooker, accelerating both AI doomsday and savior stories almost overnight. Certainly,
    prompt engineering existed long before ChatGPT, but the range of ever-changing
    techniques we use for eliciting desired responses from the plethora of language
    models that now invade our lives has really come into its own alongside the rise
    of ChatGPT. Five years ago with the unveiling of the original GPT we joked about
    how "prompt engineer" could one day become a job title; today, prompt engineers
    are one of the hottest tech (or tech adjacent) careers out there.
