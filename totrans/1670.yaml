    business) seems to show a tendency of applying somewhat complex and rather computationally
    expensive algorithms to applications that would have been easily accommodated
    in the past by much simpler (hence faster) and much more interpretable (hence
    of greater business value) techniques. In the current series of texts I am introducing
    the power and beauty of descriptive statistics as an approach for quantitatively
    describing the nature of data and creating solid foundations for any subsequent
    data investigations. In this post I will introduce another weapon of the mighty
    dwarf, of similar purpose to the technique introduced in my [previous post](/2018/03/descriptive-statistics-mighty-dwarf-data-science.html)
    – kurtosis, but of slightly different power of statistical destruction – the “crest
    factor”. You will also get to meet the scary Dragon of Demand.

    data, which was caused by some seasonal variations in the demand for the goods
    offered by an imaginary shop. We said that kurtosis is often thought of as a measure
    of the “peakidness” of the amplitude distribution of a signal and explained what
    is really meant by this, somewhat controversial to some peers, statement. As a
    result of some hands-on simulations we concluded that kurtosis is great at detecting
    single impulses. Today I want to spend some time considering what will happen
    if we encounter more than one impulse in our data and would the behaviour of kurtosis
    still be of desirable nature.

    the kurtosis was used to detect the impulse with great success. Figure 1 shows
    the data and the corresponding value of kurtosis. The metric is 6.227 - clearly
    above 3 which is default for Gaussian noise. Impulsive content was detected, success!
    So, this year the encouraged management used the same metric. After the analysis,
    the value of kurtosis came out even greater: 6.920\. “Surely we must have had
    ever larger spikes this year. Splendid!”. But further investigation revealed something
    somewhat different, as can be seen in Figure 2\. It turned out that apart from
    exactly the same impulse at day 200 as in the previous year, yet another impulse
    occurred at day 400, but it was of smaller amplitude. The difference between the
    two signals is indicated on a histogram by two arrows (Figure 3).'

    be two-fold: yes, it will increase in the presence of an impulse and yes, it will
    react proportionally to the magnitude of the impulse but it will also increase
    its value in the presence of additional impulses, even of smaller amplitudes.
    Therefore, it should be noted that kurtosis summarizes the effect of various peaks
    in the data and increased value of the metric does not always mean larger peaks.'

    for help with alternatives: “Oi, I don’t want my parameter to go up when the maximal
    value in the data does not go up. What if I am only interested in tracking the
    behaviour of the maximal peaks, but in a normalized way, so I get roughly the
    same output no matter the absolute scale of my data?”. The Dwarf is likely to
    reply the following: “I will not solve your problem entirely, but I have something
    that might help. Try the power of “crest factor”.'

- en: OK, but what does this really mean? Let us break this down a bit. The peak value
    is the maximal of the absolute value of all the samples in the data, and the RMS
    is a kind of a measure of the total “weight” of the data, or the amount of energy
    contained in the data. We can see that unlike the kurtosis, the numerator of crest
    factor (CF) does not include any summation over all the points in the data, it
    only looks at the maximal peak. At the same time the denominator is the quadratic
    mean of all the samples in the data. Having such lightweight numerator (just one
    sample) and heavyweight denominator (all the samples) may imply that the effect
    of the appearance of additional impulses in the signal (apart from the already
    present maximal peak) will be greatly offset by all the other samples in the data
    – it may come quasi-unnoticed. The effect? Far lower sensitivity to the presence
    of new impulses compared to kurtosis.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are a careful analyst, you surely noticed that CF reacted with a very
    slight, yet interesting decrease in its value. Why? Well, the numerator did not
    change – the absolute peak stayed the same – but the additional impulse caused
    the RMS of the signal to increase a tiny bit. Hence, the ratio went down.

    by greater focus on the influence of the largest impulses in the data and, as
    such, neglect (to some extent) of the importance of other, lower amplitude peaks.
