    accurate model or obtaining good, clean data. It is much harder to define feasible
    problems and come up with reasonable ways of measuring solutions. This post discusses
    some examples of these issues and how they can be addressed.

    the two main contenders: model fitting and data collection/cleaning.'

    This belief is fueled in part by the success of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/),
    that calls itself *the home of data science*. Most Kaggle competitions are focused
    on model fitting: Participants are given a well-defined problem, a dataset, and
    a measure to optimise, and they compete to produce the most accurate model. Coupling
    Kaggle’s excellent marketing with their competition setup leads many people to
    believe that data science is all about fitting models. In reality, building reasonably-accurate
    models is not that hard, because many model-building phases can easily be automated.
    Indeed, there are many companies that offer model fitting as a service (e.g.,
    Microsoft, Amazon, Google and [others](http://www.shivonzilis.com/machineintelligence)).
    Even Ben Hamner, CTO of Kaggle, has said that he is “surprised at the number of
    ‘black box machine learning in the cloud’ services emerging: model fitting is
    easy. Problem definition and data collection are not.”'

    DJ Patil (US Chief Data Scientist) is [quoted as saying](http://codingvc.com/talk-summary-building-great-data-products)
    that “the hardest part of data science is getting good, clean data. Cleaning data
    is often 80% of the work.” While I agree that collecting data and cleaning it
    can be a lot of work, I don’t think of this part as particularly hard. It’s definitely
    important and may require careful planning, but in many cases it just isn’t very
    challenging. In addition, it is often the case that the data is already given,
    or is collected using previously-developed methods.'

- en: There are many reasons why problem definition can be hard. It is sometimes due
    to stakeholders who don’t know what they want, and [expect data scientists to
    solve all their data problems (either real or imagined)](http://yanirseroussi.com/2015/08/24/you-dont-need-a-data-scientist-yet/).
    This type of situation is summarised by [the following Dilbert strip](http://dilbert.com/strip/2012-07-29).
    It is best handled by cleverly managing stakeholder expectations, while stirring
    them towards better-defined problem.
