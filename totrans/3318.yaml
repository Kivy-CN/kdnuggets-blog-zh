- en: 10 days? Hm, that’s definitely a challenging task :). However, I think that
    10 days is also definitely a time frame where you can get a pretty good overview
    of machine learning field and maybe get started to apply some techniques to your
    problems.

- en: After reading an introduction to the 3 different subfields (supervised learning,
    unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning). I would probably spend the
    time on simple (yet useful) algorithms that are representative of these fields
    (and maybe save reinforcement learning for later). E.g., Simple linear regression
    and Ridge Regression for regression analysis, logistic regression and k-nearest
    neighbors for classification, and k-means and hierarchical clustering for clustering
    tasks. Once you understand the goals of each algorithm and how they try to solve
    a particular problem, it is fairly easy to add more algorithms and approaches
    to your repertoire.

    data (feature selection, transformation, and compression) and how to evaluate
    your models. Maybe, as a starter, you could check out our Machine Learning in
    scikit-learn tutorial at SciPy 2016\. It’s approx. 6 hours and summarizes most
    of the basics while introducing the scikit-learn library, which can come in handy
    for implementation and further studies:'

    Ng’s cousera course [Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
    (and [my book](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130))
    provide a gentle introduction, but I realize that this is probably not within
    the scope of 10 days :).
