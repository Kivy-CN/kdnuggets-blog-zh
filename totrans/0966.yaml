- en: The reality is that employers cannot understand their employees’ issues unless
    they use data, specifically people analytics. Too many organizations invest resources
    into DEI without tangible goals to support their workers, which is where DEI is
    the most impactful for businesses that wish to make a change.

    and meaningful plans to work toward DEI goals by tracking metrics such as hiring,
    complaints, promotions, and other human resources measurements. For example, looking
    into hiring practices can reveal biases that inform relevant teams about why departments
    might not be as diverse.

    shows that only [7% of company leaders](https://www.hracuity.com/e-books/people-leaders-gap-in-managing-employee-issues)

    be that using people analytics requires a continuous effort, and the implementation

    by using people analytics to lay the foundation for concrete goals. However, data
    cannot help businesses unless they know how to use it. Putting in the work to
    measure and analyze people analytics is worthwhile, as long as executives clearly
    understand its purpose.

    concerned about creating welcoming, accommodating workplaces with diverse team
    members. Using people analytics to measure various aspects of the work environment
    can help organizations meet DEI goals, but they must first have a plan to appropriately
    measure employee data. Tracking people analytics is a necessary and worthwhile
    step toward implementing DEI.
