- en: I get asked data science career advice on LinkedIn regularly. As much as I would
    like to use my limited knowledge to answer peoples' specific questions, it genuinely
    becomes too time-consuming. I have created posts in the past to try to shed light
    on topics of interest to wider numbers of people, [such as this one](/2017/02/5-career-paths-data-science-big-data-explained.html),
    but individual, personalized requests are, unfortunately, not something I can
    usually partake in.

    as a bit of a jackass, quite honestly. I don't posses any special insight beyond
    what my limited experience has allotted me; however, my association with KDnuggets
    and my activity on LinkedIn perhaps makes people think that the individual behind
    that activity might be worth reaching out to. I'm really the furthest thing from
    conceited that there is, and would be happy to share what I do know with everyone,
    time permitting.

    forest and find a tree that interests you. What aspect of data science caught
    your attention? Is it machine learning? Is it descriptive statistics? Is it data
    visualization? Is it distributed computing? Do you like algorithm design? Do you
    have a background in business, but have sufficient knowledge to talk predictive
    analytics to clients, and would enjoy interfacing with "the back room?"

    Finding that personal signal should be your very first task in pursuing "data

    valuable. Are you approaching data science from a computer science perspective?
    From a mathematics background? As a web developer? As a business analyst? A particle
    physicist?

- en: Realistic expectations are a must, too. Do you have a PhD? A Master's? An undergraduate
    degree? Are you self-taught, with MOOCs, textbooks, and the like? Don't let anyone
    tell you that the world of "data science" is unreachable for someone who is self-taught...
    at the same time, don't expect that you will be doing research at DeepMind after
    a couple of MOOCs. Know where it is that you might fit in.

- en: Insofar as R and Hadoop, they’re just part of the data science toolkit. They
    don’t constitute “data science” any more than a scalpel constitutes “surgery.”
    In the same way that physics relies upon mathematics, data science relies upon
    statistical tools for handling large and small data sets, structured and unstructured
    data, etc. But the mathematics of physics is not a substitute for scientific thinking,
    analysis, approach or method—and neither are Hadoop and R substitutes for understanding
    behaviour in data.

    the opposite direction: just as not a single (or pair, in this case) skill does
    not a data scientist make, data scientists do not possess any single, unified
    body of skills, with each individual bringing their own set of competencies to
    the profession.'

    like grouping all of the possible roles and tasks that all doctors, nurses, physiotherapists,
    personal support workers, and all other health professionals could assume and
    labeling them all "health scientists" (yes, I know **health science** is a thing).
