- en: The AI and Machine Learning industry is booming like never before. As of 2021,
    the increase in AI usage across businesses will create $2.9 trillion of business
    value. AI has automated many industries across the globe and changed the way they
    operate. Most large companies incorporate AI to maximize productivity in their
    workflow, and industries like marketing and healthcare have undergone a paradigm
    shift due to the consolidation of AI.

    you will need to predict using information like house area, number of bedrooms,
    number of bathrooms, and utilities.

    a great beginner-level dataset to start with. This dataset is used to predict
    the 10-year risk of CHD (Coronary Heart Disease). The dependent variables in this
    dataset are the risk factors of heart disease, including diabetes, smoking, high
    blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.
  prefs: []

    problem, and the target variable is either 0 or 1–0 for the patients who never
    developed heart disease and 1 for the patients who did. You can perform some feature
    selection on this dataset to identify features that most contribute towards heart
    risk. Then, you can fit a classification model onto the independent variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    did **not **develop heart disease. An imbalanced dataset needs to be handled using
    the right feature engineering techniques like oversampling, weight-tuning, or
    undersampling. If not dealt with properly, you will end up with a model that simply
    predicts the majority class for each data point and cannot identify patients who **did **develop
    heart disease. This is an excellent dataset for you to practice your feature engineering
    and machine learning skills.

    problems like this one. A key challenge in breast cancer identification is the
    inability to distinguish between benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous)
    tumors. The dataset has variables like “radius_mean” and “area_mean” of the tumor,
    and you will need to classify based on these features if a tumor is cancerous
    or not. This dataset is relatively easy to work with since there is no need to

    helped speed up the model building process. The tricky part of these machine learning
    and [data science projects](https://www.dezyre.com/projects/data-science-projects) is
    the data collection, pre-processing, and deployment. If you land a job in machine
    learning, most algorithms will be pretty simple to build. It will only take a
    day or two to create a sales prediction model. You will spend most of your time
    finding appropriate data sources and putting your models into production to derive
    business value.
