- en: Statistics is a fundamental skill that data scientists use every day. It is
    the branch of mathematics that allows us to collect, describe, interpret, visualise,
    and make inferences about data. Data scientists will use it for data analysis,
    experiment design, and statistical modelling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statistics is also essential for machine learning. We will use statistics to
    understand the data prior to training a model. When we take samples of data for
    training and testing our models we need to employ statistical techniques to ensure
    fairness. When evaluating the performance of a model we need statistics to assess
    the variability of the predictions and assess accuracy.

- en: Statistics is a very broad field, and only part of it is relevant to data science.
    This book is extremely good at only covering the areas related to data science.
    So if you are looking for a book that will quickly give you just enough understanding
    to be able to practice data science then this book is definitely the one to choose.
  prefs: []

    clear explanations for any statistical terms used and also links out to other
    resources for further reading.

    and also contains lots of code examples, this time written in Python. It is aimed
    heavily at programmers and relies on using that skill to understand the key statistical
    concepts introduced. This book is therefore ideally suited to those who already
    have at least a basic grasp of Python.

- en: Bayesian inference is a branch of statistics that deals with understanding uncertainty.
    As a data scientist uncertainty is something you will need to model on a very
    regular basis. If you are building a machine learning model, for example, you
    will need to be able to understand the uncertainty around the predictions that
    your model is delivering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bayesian methods can be quite abstract and difficult to understand. This book
    aimed firmly at programmers (so some Python is a prerequisite), is the only material
    I have found that explains these concepts in a simple enough way for a non-statistician
    to understand. There are coded examples throughout and the Github repository,
    where the chapters are hosted, contains a large selection of notebooks. It is,
    therefore, an excellent hands-on introduction to this subject.

- en: This book covers general statistical techniques rather than just those aimed
    at data scientists or programmers. It is however written in a very straight forward
    style and covers a wide range and depth of statistical concepts in a very simple
    to understand way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book was originally written for students studying a non-mathematics based
    course where an understanding of statistics is required, such as the social sciences.
    It, therefore, covers enough theory to understand the techniques but doesn’t assume
    an existing mathematical background. It is, therefore, an ideal book to read if
    you are coming into data science without a math-based degree.

    and Frequentist statistical inference methodologies.

    of the best material I have seen on this subject. Each explanation is in-depth
    and uses practical examples such as the classification of spam data which makes
    quite complex ideas easier to digest. The book is most suited to those who have
    already covered the basics of statistics for data analysis and are familiar with
    some statistical notation.

    to learn all the statistics needed for data science. They can all be read for
    free online but most also have a print version that can be purchased if you prefer
    to read physical books. Statistics is an essential component of the data science
    toolset and something which often requires in-depth reading to truly understand
    the concepts. Something which these books can provide.
