    and you probably have, at the very least, an idea of what it is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the cave-dwelling hermits out there, MLOps is a collection of procedures,
    implementations, and practices for machine learning model deployment and life
    cycle maintenance. If you are familiar with DevOps — a similar approach for the
    continuous development of software — you will undoubtedly note that MLOps is a
    portmanteau of machine Learning (ML) and the very same 'Ops' from DevOps.

    provide an end-to-end machine learning development process to design, build and
    manage reproducible, testable, and evolvable ML-powered software.

    philosophy?) for managing machine learning projects in the real world, from their
    inception, to their (hopefully!) inevitable continuous updated as time marches
    on. Don't get fooled into thinking that contemporary machine learning consists
    only of creating models in Jupyter notebooks; learn MLOps and be useful in there
    real world. This is as good a place as any to start that learning journey.

    can be useful? The freeCodeCamp course "[Free MLOps Crash Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF1WZJM_YtY),"
    as instructed by Hamza Tahir of [ZenML](https://www.zenml.io/), does a good job
    of answering these questions and more in a tight one hour long discussion.
  prefs: []

- en: The course is based on [ZenML](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml), a framework
    that allows you to "build portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines."
  prefs: []

- en: ZenML helps you standardize your ML workflows as ML **Pipelines** consisting
    of decoupled, modular **Steps**. This enables you to write portable code that
    can be moved from experimentation to production in seconds.
