    statistical testing can be utilized to inspect/verify random distribution of bucket
    member attributes (e.g. ensure that significantly more US visitors did not get
    assigned to bucket A). If not, a new random assignment can be attempted (with
    a similar inspection/verification process), or -- if it is determined that the
    population does not conform to a cooperative distribution -- an approach such
    as the following can be pursued.

    to bucket assignment, [stratified random sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling)

    help eliminate selection bias, which is the archenemy of A/B testing.

    be filled from the entire site's users, while the other would be filled from the

    apples to all oranges, and thus ill-advised.

    of commitment between the groups may lead to a higher percentage of click-throughs
    for those in the bucket with subject line #2 -- again, even with the same content.'

    an A/B test could commence with different feeder locations to the same opt-in
    -- of the same content -- and move to to different follow-up landing spots after
    opt-in, with the intent of measuring what users do on the resulting landing page
    being the goal.

    follow-up behavior? Sure, it's still an A/B test, with the same goals, setup,
    and evaluation; however, the exact user psychology being measured is different.

    We also want to examine how effective are tweets - how likely they are to be retweeted,
    favorited, or the links inside clicked upon. What exactly is an influential user
    depends on the definition - different types of influence discussed included celebrities,
    opinion leaders, influencers, discussers, innovators, topical experts, curators,
