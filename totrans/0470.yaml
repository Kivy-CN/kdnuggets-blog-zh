    a multitude of assumptions about the person(s) I am communicating with. I don’t
    explicitly define very important aspects before stating exactly what I am saying
    which, depending on the context, has the potential to dilute the actual message
    I wish to put across.

    of breaking into Data Science by networking. In response to this article, I received
    lots of connection requests on LinkedIn stating that they wish to connect with
    me so that they could build their professional network.

    fact, I encourage it at the end of every article I write. I’m extremely grateful
    that I am in a position where people wish to connect with me and follow me on
    my journey in Data Science. The purpose of sharing my experiences with you all
    is that I wish to express the realities of being a Data Scientist or freelancer
    from my point of view, as we all strive to become indispensable.

    you’ve fallen into the trap once again. It’s the wrong mindset. If you’re thinking
    about his billions, it’s likely you’re thinking about what’s in it for you. That’s

- en: Becoming a creator and sharing what you are doing online may seem like a daunting
    task at first, especially if you’re naturally introverted as I am — overcoming
    this issue begins by sharing one thing then never stopping from there. If you
    wish to grow a strong and healthy network then it’s important that you step into
    the shoes of a creator — from then, everything would come to you.
