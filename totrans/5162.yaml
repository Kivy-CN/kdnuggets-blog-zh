- en: It’s no secret that containers offer many benefits—they’re portable, secure,
    stateful, customizable, and require no installation. But there’s a major stumbling
    block that IT faces with containerized stateful workloads like Microsoft SQL Server
    Docker containers, and that’s figuring out how to implement high availability
    (HA).

    and scaling of computer applications. But as a standalone, K8s’ native HA is too
    slow to support the workloads of SQL Server Docker containers. K8s also don’t
    support SQL Server Availability Groups (AG).

- en: Since Kubernetes lacks support for automatic failover using SQL Server AG, it’s
    prudent to tap into this new smart high availability software, which overcomes
    this obstacle. With the new software, companies can achieve expected SQL Server
    AG performance in Kubernetes with SQL Server Docker containers, ensuring business
    continuity. A best practice is to use K8s to offer HA at the pod level for SQL
    Server Docker containers, while leveraging smart high availability software at
    the database level to provide SQL Server AG support.

- en: To simplify establishing a SQL Server cluster and provisioning your SQL Server
    AG inside Kubernetes, the software can come as a SQL Server cluster service. It’s
    installed on each SQL Server Docker container and is responsible for the core
    management, network management, fault detection, and failover automation for the
    SQL Server AG in Kubernetes. Smart high availability software offers other benefits,
    too, in that it’s flexible, with SQL Server clustering supporting Windows and
    Linux alike. The software can also be configured to “mix and match,” running inside
    and/or outside SQL Server Docker containers.

- en: Need to move from one platform to another? Smart high availability software
    can also assist with migration. You can leverage built-in software-defined perimeter
    features, including Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) tunneling, to create multi-cloud
    environments. For SQL Server Docker containers, the software manages the needed
    ZTNA tunneling for cluster communication and SQL Server AG replication between
    different types of nodes in different clouds.

- en: It's possible to run this new class of smart high availability software for
    SQL Server Docker containers inside or outside K8s, making it a snap to set up
    clusters located in different locations, keeping everything secure by way of ZTNA
    tunneling and automatic failover between Kubernetes clusters. The software provides
    the needed HA boost since K8s alone does not support SQL Server AG with automatic
    failover.

- en: Smart high availability software allows an SQL Server AG to be formed between
    SQL Server Docker containers—not to mention easier deployment, since it allows
    IT to generate an image of a Docker container image incorporating not only SQL
    Server but also the smart high availability software. That image can then be leveraged
    to deploy SQL Server Docker containers.

- en: The bottom line? Smart high availability software allows organizations to overcome
    the traditional problems of implementing SQL Server AGs in Kubernetes. Enterprises
    can leverage the software to incorporate automatic failover and create hybrid
    Kubernetes SQL Server AG clusters across networks. The result is protection against
    common failures in nodes, containers, and applications, and no more headaches
    from HA/DR configuration.
