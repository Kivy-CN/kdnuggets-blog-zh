- en: '"Data scientist" is a vague new job and you never know what tools you''ll need
    to succeed. Lots of stuff I do at work I have never done before, but grad school
    was as much about learning how to learn quickly & think mathematically, as it
    was about learning specific models & techniques.'

    those thoughts up. Everything else you can teach yourself on the spot. But here
    is a giant list roughly in order of increasing complexity.
