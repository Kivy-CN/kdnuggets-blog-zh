- en: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being talked about everywhere these days, and
    it impacts our lives whether we realize it or not. This will continue to increase,
    so now’s a great time to learn more about the subject.

    your 2020 reading list!

- en: A shameless plug given that I wrote this book, although I believe it will provide
    significant value to a wide-ranging audience. It’s becoming imperative for business
    leaders to understand artificial intelligence and machine learning at an appropriate
    level in order to build great data-centric products and solutions.

- en: I wrote *AI for People and Business* for executives, managers, and non-technical
    folks interested in leveraging AI successfully within their organization, and
    to help readers understand the many benefits of AI for both people and business.
    I also wrote the book for practitioners interested in a business perspective around
    AI, and to provide simplified frameworks and models to help readers understand
    and explain complex concepts related to AI.

    and AI for a non-technical or non-expert reader.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book really helps the reader understand the many different types of algorithmic
    approaches to data and computer-based learning and intelligence, along with the
    advantages and limitations of each algorithmic approach. It also helps develop
    ideas and concepts around what is needed for computers to truly exhibit human-like
    intelligence, which is much harder than most people realize.

- en: '*The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book* provides an excellent overview of
    machine learning for practitioners. The book covers most areas that a practitioner
    should know about, and includes an appropriate amount of theory and math without
    being overly technical or mathematically rigorous.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think all practitioners should have this book on their bookshelf, and it would
    also benefit non-practitioners that want to take a deeper dive into all aspects
    of machine learning.

- en: '*Machine Learning Yearning* is a great book for practitioners. It is similar
    to the hundred-page machine learning book in its broad coverage of machine learning
    and its application to artificial intelligence, but is written more in a *how-to*
    or *cookbook* style.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is also written in a very logical order that closely mimics the typical
    process that a data scientist or machine learning engineer would follow when working
    on an end-to-end machine learning project, along with discussing relevant key
    considerations and tradeoffs.
