    projects a year given the iterative nature of the process and the manual work
    that goes into data preparation and feature engineering. In 2019, data science
    automation platforms will capture much of the mind share. Data science automation
    will cover much wider areas than machine learning automation, including data preparation,
    feature engineering, machine learning and the production of data science pipelines.

    once the sexiest job of the 21st century, will become very different from what

    and data prep tools become more powerful, the data scientist will transform into
    more of a consultant than a data sourcing and preparation expert. They will be
    charged with helping the business make sense of data, understanding how to interpret
    results, and what courses of action might be warranted. It’s a higher value role
    for the data scientist and ultimately, a better use of their skills.'

    will continue to hype a bit throughout 2019 but then face the problem that only
    fairly well-defined types of data science problems lend themselves to full automation.
    Much more powerful are environments where the data scientist can mix automation
    with interaction, truly allowing them to deploy data science to others without
    having to outsource all of it to self-declared experts. Interpretability will
    turn into a larger problem for deep learning for all types of data where understanding
    (or controlling) the underlying decision is important. We will never accept "human
    failure" from AI for safety critical decisions.

    and load forecasting for energy production, predicting failures in industrial

    in 2019\. Most enterprises have reached a point of digital maturity, ensuring
    access to quality data at scale. With mature data sets, AI providers can offer
    lower cost, easier to use AI tools for specific business use cases. The effect
    of enterprise AI at scale will be significant. Gartner expects the business value
    of AI to hit nearly $3.9 trillion in by 2022\. Consumers also stand to benefit
    in almost every sector. They’ll see more innovative products and services, smarter
    homes, factories and cities, improved health, and a higher quality of life.

    improving efficiency and performance, generating huge cost savings, and giving
    rise to more innovative products and services. However, the future of work will
    involve humans and AI. The most innovative companies have already started planning
    how to best make this symbiotic future a reality. In the shorter term – this means
    the gap in skilled workers in data science will persists and demand will remain
    very high. Educational opportunities will expand to help address the need. In
    the long term – as we develop the skills and technology to unlock AI – society
    stands to benefit enormously from AI-augmented workers, homes, vehicles, power
    grids, factories, cities, more.
