- en: The biggest difference between Google Bard and ChatGPT is that, as of this writing,
    Bard knows about ChatGPT but ChatGPT is blissfully unaware of Bard. But I can
    play around with ChatGPT, while Google Bard is still out of reach for most of
    us.

    for an eye-watering $10 billion (in addition to an earlier $1 billion investment).
    Google, panicking slightly that their search monopoly might be at an end, responded
    by unveiling Bard, their version of the technology with some flaws. In its very
    first live demo, Bard [made several factual errors.](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590864/google-ai-chatbot-bard-mistake-error-exoplanet-demo)

    creating a friendly AI. The chatbot sits on GPT-3.5, which is a large language
    model that, when given text, can continue the prompt.

    called Common Crawl. Common Crawl contains petabytes of web data with raw web
    page data, metadata extracts, and text extracts. It includes, for instance, [a
    collection of our own URLs](https://index.commoncrawl.org/CC-MAIN-2023-06-index?url=*.stratascratch.com&output=json)
    from [StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+ChatGPT+vs+Bard).

    to ChatGPT’s popularity. Unlike ChatGPT, Bard is powered by Google’s [own model
    LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/), which is short for Language
    Model for Dialogue Applications. And unlike ChatGPT, it’s not as exciting for
    the simple reason that most people can’t access it yet. Though Google did host
    an error-laden demo of Bard in early February, right now it’s only available to
    a select few.
  prefs: []

    who the president is, and it doesn’t know. This is because the training data was
    cut off around mid-2021\. Bard, meanwhile, draws on information on the internet
    today. Ask Bard, and in theory, Bard should be able to pull from the data available
    on the internet today to tell you who the president is.

    its training data, we just don’t know that much - yet - about the data that Bard
    was trained on.

    Google’s researchers said that 12.5% of the training data came from Common Crawl,
    like GPT-n models. Another 12.5% comes from Wikipedia. And according to the research
    paper, they used 1.56 trillion words of “public dialog data and web text.”

    You can think of parameters as knobs or levers that the model adjusts to fit the

    more capacity to capture complex relationships in language, but it also runs the
    risk of overfitting.
