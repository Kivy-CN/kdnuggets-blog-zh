    you probably already know about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    GDPR defines and strengthens data protection for consumers and harmonizes data
    security rules within the EU. The European Parliament [approved](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160407IPR21776/data-protection-reform-parliament-approves-new-rules-fit-for-the-digital-era)
    the measure on April 27, 2016\. It goes into effect in less than a year, on May
    25, 2018.

    about GDPR focuses on how the new rules affect the collection and management of
    personally identifiable information (PII) about consumers. However, GDPR will
    also change how organizations practice data science. That is the subject of this
    blog post.

- en: One caveat before we begin. GDPR is complicated. In some areas, GDPR defines
    high-level outcomes, but delegates detailed compliance rules to a new entity,
    the European Data Protection Board. GDPR regulations intersect with many national
    laws and regulations; organizations that conduct business in the United Kingdom
    must also assess the unknown impacts of Brexit. Organizations subject to GDPR
    should engage expert management and legal counsel to assist in developing a compliance
    plan.

    on data processing and consumer profiling. Second, for organizations that use
    automated decision-making, GDPR creates a “right to an explanation” for consumers.
    Third, GDPR holds firms accountable for bias and discrimination in automated decisions.

    and consumer profiling; these rules supplement the requirements for data collection
    and management. GDPR defines profiling as:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of
    personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person,
    in particular, to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s
    performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests,
    reliability, behaviour, location or movements.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, organizations may process personal data when they can demonstrate
    a legitimate business purpose (such as a customer or employment relationship)
    that does not conflict with the consumer’s rights and freedoms. Organizations
    must inform consumers about profiling and its consequences, and provide them with
    the opportunity to opt out.

- en: '**The Right to an Explanation****.** GDPR grants consumers the right “not to
    be subject to a decision…which is based solely on automated processing and which
    provides legal effects (on the subject).”  Experts [characterize](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08813)
    this rule as a “right to an explanation.”  GDPR does not precisely define the
    scope of decisions covered by this section. The United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s
    Office (ICO) [says](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2013559/big-data-ai-ml-and-data-protection.pdf)
    that the right is “very likely” to apply to credit applications, recruitment,

    Board may define the scope differently.'

    they may not use specific categories of personal data in automated decisions except

    examine the impact in three key areas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Data Processing and Profiling.** The new rules allow organizations to process
    personal data for specific business purposes, fulfill contractual commitments,
    and comply with national laws. A credit card issuer may process personal data
    to determine a cardholder’s available credit; a bank may screen transactions for
    money laundering as directed by regulators. Consumers may not opt out of processing
    and profiling performed under these “safe harbors.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, organizations may not use personal data for a purpose other than the
    original intent without securing additional permission from the consumer. This
    requirement could limit the amount of data available for exploratory data science.
  prefs: []

    identifies an individual consumer.

    data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer

    decisions. The impact on data scientists, however, may be exaggerated:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: — The “right to an explanation” is limited in scope. As noted above, one regulator
    interprets the law to cover credit applications, recruitment, and insurance decisions.
    Other regulators or law courts may interpret the rules differently, but it’s clear
    that the right applies in specific settings. It does not apply to every automated
    decision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: — In many jurisdictions, a “right to an explanation” already exists and has
    existed for years. For example, regulations governing credit decisions in the
    United Kingdom are similar to those in the United States, where issuers must provide
    an explanation for adverse credit decisions based on credit bureau information.
    GDPR expands the scope of these rules, but tools for compliance are commercially
    available today.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: — Most businesses that decline some customer requests understand that adverse
    decisions should be explained to customers. This is already common practice in
    the lending and insurance industries. Some businesses treat adverse decisions
    as an opportunity to position an alternate product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: — The need to deliver an explanation affects *decision engines* but need not
    influence the choice of methods for *model training*. Techniques available today
    make it possible to “reverse-engineer” interpretable explanations for model scores
    even if the data scientist uses an opaque method to train the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nevertheless, there are good [reasons](http://www.csail.mit.edu/making_computers_explain_themselves)
    for data scientists to consider using interpretable techniques. Financial services
    giant Capital One [considers](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604122/the-financial-world-wants-to-open-ais-black-boxes/)
    them to be a potent weapon against hidden bias (discussed below.) But one should
    not conclude that GDPR will force data scientists to limit the techniques they
    use to train predictive models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Bias and Discrimination.** GDPR requires that organizations must avoid discriminatory
    effects in automated decisions. This rule places an extra burden of due diligence

- en: GDPR expressly prohibits the use of personal characteristics (such as age, race,
    ethnicity, and other enumerated classes) in automated decisions. However, it is
    not sufficient to just avoid using this data. The mandate against discriminatory
    outcomes means data scientists must also take steps to prevent indirect bias from
    proxy variables, multicollinearity or other causes. For example, an automated
    decision that uses a seemingly neutral characteristic, such as a consumer’s residential
    neighborhood, may inadvertently discriminate against ethnic minorities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists must also take affirmative steps to confirm that the data they
    use when they develop predictive models is accurate; “garbage in/garbage out,”
    or GIGO, is not a defense. They must also consider whether biased training data
    on past outcomes can bias models. As a result, data scientists will need to concern
    themselves with [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage), to
    trace the flow of data through all processing steps from source to target. GDPR
    will also drive greater concern for [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility),
    or the ability to accurately replicate a predictive modeling project.
