- en: The gold rush in Generative AI is well and truly underway. Generative AI (GenAI)
    is now creating content — words, images, videos, and audio — that is often indistinguishable
    from that produced by humans. Writing, visual design, coding, marketing, game
    production, music composition, and product design are just a few of the areas
    of human creativity that are being rapidly impacted by GenAI. As creative services
    are integrated into products like Microsoft Office 365, Slack, Discord, Salesforce
    Cloud, and Gmail, GenAI will increase the productivity of billions of people before
    we know it. We will all soon use GenAI to create our first drafts of anything
    and everything.

    Although GenAI is still in its infancy, problems with Foundational Models are
    becoming apparent. The issues range from **truth** (GenAI producing content that
    is simply wrong), **bias** (prejudice against specific groups) and **toxicity** (e.g.
    racist, misogynistic, or hate speech). In early 2023, a massive [$100 billion

    build scale and a flywheel for their copilot use cases. Similarly, a few full
    stack startups will prosper in specialized use cases like drug discovery. Due
    to their large fundraising rounds, uniforms markets, and quick adoption of innovation
    by people, businesses, and governments, US startups will dominate. But, the majority
