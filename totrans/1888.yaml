    science terminology. There are all sorts of articles written by all types of people
    relaying their opinions to anyone who will listen. It's almost overwhelming.

    defining and comparing these related terms, the fact is that much of this terminology
    is fluid, is not entirely agreed-upon, and, frankly, being exposed to other peoples'
    views is one of the best ways to test and refine your own.

    much of this terminology, there may still be something one can get out of this.
    Several concepts central to data science will be examined. Or, at least, central
    *in my opinion*. I will do my best to put forth how they relate to one another
    and how they fit together as individual pieces of a larger puzzle.

    the concepts individually, KDnuggets' Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro has put together
    the following Venn diagram which outlines the relationship between the very same
    data science terminology we will be considering herein. The reader is encouraged
    to compare this Venn diagram with Drew Conway's now famous [data science Venn
    diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), as
    well as my own discussion below and modified process/relationship diagram near
    the bottom of the post. I think that, while differences exist, the concepts line
    up with some degree of similarity (see the previous few paragraphs).

- en: There are all sorts of articles available defining big data, and I won't spend
    much time on this concept here. I will simply state that big data could very generally
    be defined as datasets of a size "[beyond the ability of commonly used software
    tools to capture, manage, and process](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Cloud-Computing-Foundations-Applications-ebook/dp/B00CMQJZWE)."
    Big data is a moving target; this definition is both vague and accurate enough
    to capture its central characteristic.

  zh: 关于大数据有各种各样的文章定义，我在这里不会花费太多时间讨论这个概念。我只是简单地表示，大数据可以很一般地定义为"[超出常用软件工具捕获、管理和处理能力的
    数据集](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Cloud-Computing-Foundations-Applications-ebook/dp/B00CMQJZWE)。"
    大数据是一个不断变化的目标；这个定义既模糊又足够准确，以捕捉其核心特征。

    understanding of their search term popularities and N-gram frequencies, in order
    to help separate the hard fact from the hype. Given that a pair of these concepts
    are relatively new, the N-gram frequencies for our 'older' concepts from 1980
    to 2008 are shown above.

  zh: '**机器学习**'
- en: According to [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) in his [seminal book
    on the subject](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html),
    machine learning is "concerned with the question of how to construct computer
    programs that automatically improve with experience." Machine learning is interdisciplinary
    in nature, and employs techniques from the fields of computer science, statistics,
    and artificial intelligence, among others. The main artifacts of machine learning
    research are algorithms which facilitate this automatic improvement from experience,
    algorithms which can be applied in a variety of diverse fields.

  zh: 根据[汤姆·米切尔](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/)在他的[开创性著作](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html)中所述，机器学习“关注于如何构建能够自动随着经验而改进的计算机程序。”
    机器学习具有跨学科的性质，采用计算机科学、统计学、人工智能等领域的技术。机器学习研究的主要成果是算法，这些算法促使自动改进经验，并可以应用于各种不同的领域。
- en: I don't think there is anyone who would doubt that machine learning is a central
    aspect of data science. I give the term *data science* detailed treatment below,
    but if you consider that at a very high level its goal is to extract insight from
    data, machine learning is the engine which allows this process to be automated.
    Machine learning has a lot in common with classical statistics, in that it uses
    samples to infer and make generalizations. Where statistics has more of a focus
    on the descriptive (though it *can*, by extrapolation, be predictive), machine
    learning has very little concern with the descriptive, and employs it only as
    an intermediate step in order to be able to make predictions. Machine learning
    is often thought to be synonymous with pattern recognition; while that really
    won't get much disagreement from me, I believe that the term *pattern recognition*
    implies a much less sophisticated and more simplistic set of processes than machine
    learning actually is, which is why I tend to shy away from it.

  zh: 我认为没有人会怀疑机器学习是数据科学的核心方面。我在下面详细阐述了*数据科学*这个术语，但如果你从一个很高的层次考虑，它的目标是从数据中提取洞察力，那么机器学习就是实现这一过程自动化的引擎。机器学习与经典统计学有很多相似之处，它使用样本进行推断和概括。统计学更多关注描述（尽管它*可以*通过推断进行预测），而机器学习几乎不关心描述，仅将其作为能够进行预测的中间步骤。机器学习常被认为是模式识别的同义词；虽然这不会引起我太多异议，但我相信*模式识别*这个术语暗示了一套比机器学习实际更不复杂、更简单的过程，这就是我倾向于回避这个术语的原因。
