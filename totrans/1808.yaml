    where developers ask themselves “what can we create next?” At Foodpairing, we
    help brands answer that question through a hybrid method using consumer behavior
    data and scientific analysis.

    spending too much time in the fuzzy front end (this is the time between idea conception
    of a new product flavor and the beginning of its development).

    and trend reports are too general to provide a business with actionable insights.
    Companies are left to rely on intuition - a costly risk.

    (CFI), which shortens the fuzzy front end of the product development process.

    the massive insights it gives into what consumers are looking for in new flavors
    and tastes.

    pervasive challenges to come up with new flavor lines.

    flavor palate is evolving at a rapid pace and new products are constantly hitting
    the shelves in order to keep up.

    this to a lack of precision in the fuzzy front end of market.

- en: Third, a new generation of agile companies have entered the markets. Local craft
    producers, for example, create strong brands with high quality, on-trend products.
    Their development cycle is shorter than multinational companies, creating a shorter
    time to market.
  prefs: []

    new flavor lines. To address these numerous challenges, we created a solution
    that surveyed the market from a more holistic perspective.

    We then complete an analysis using our molecular approach to food items. Here,
    we analyze aromas and measure their compatibility with other flavors. We also
    complete a brand analysis, which uses qualitative methods to describe the brand
    itself, including its visual identity and tone of voice, as well as the particular
    product’s attributes, such as texture and taste. We then can score flavor options
    against our analysis of the brand identity.

    data, chef inspiration is that it reduces the cost of trial and error for R&D
    teams.

- en: The current toolbox in the fuzzy front end is not sufficient anymore. Marketing
    managers, development chefs, and R&D managers lack actionable market and consumer
    insights. Nowadays, research techniques work great in evaluation, but not during
    the idea generation phase.

    at the right moment. This is key to make a new flavor line successful. The market
    research we provide is tightly linked to consumer preference at that moment and
    into the future.

    We’ve set this ball in motion by becoming more active in market research organizations
    to increase the industry’s visibility. As an outsider in market research circles,
    we are excited at the prospective of challenging players in this sector to always
    be thinking of the next application of data.
