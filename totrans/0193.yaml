- en: Automation is currently the biggest reason why there is a shift in the job landscape.
    As more and more tasks are getting done by artificial intelligence and fewer are
    getting done by actual humans, you can understand why companies will start to
    lay off employees. The cost with employees comes with a salary, pension, health
    insurance, maternity/paternity leave and more. More companies are seeing employees
    as a loss, and automating artificial intelligence tools is their biggest breakthrough.

- en: Just a few weeks ago, the world was hit with ChatGPT and Google Bard. More and
    more industries are adopting AI-powered chatbots to provide customer service.
    With the rise of large language models, we can only expect these chatbots to get
    better at handling customers' queries, answering their questions, resolving problems,
    and even making sales.
  prefs: []

    as signing up new applicants for insurance, Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti
    Money Laundering (AML) policies and processes. The implementation of automated
    tooling for tasks as sensitive as these proves to use the success of AI and how
    it will only continue.

    There were some flaws in this sector due to the tasks being very repetitive and

    data, the better their analytical outputs will be. This unfortunately will cause
    a shift in the need for people to work along the AI systems, rather than the AI
    systems working for people.
