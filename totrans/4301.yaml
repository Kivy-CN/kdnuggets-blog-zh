    talked about NLP, its real-world applications, and some of its core concepts.
    Now I want to show you that NLP is as real as it gets, and anyone can start learning
    it. How? Let’s start with a simple text, and perform some Exploratory Data Analysis
    (EDA) around it using some NLP techniques. This way we can make sense out of data
    with simple and powerful tools before getting ourselves busy with any model or
    more complex tasks.

    huge problems while performing other tasks like sentiment analysis. If a word’s
    context is affected (e.g. by removing the word ‘not’, which is a negation of a
    component), that action can alter the meaning of the passage.

- en: We’ve only scratched the surface of all the possible and more complex NLP techniques
    out there. And it’s not just structured texts that you may want to analyze, but
    all that data generated from conversations, declarations or even tweets, which
    are examples of unstructured data. **Unstructured data** doesn’t fit neatly into
    the traditional row and column structure of relational databases, and represent
    the vast majority of data available in the actual world. It is messy and hard
    to manipulate.

    and the increase in computational power, which allow us to achieve meaningful
    results in areas like healthcare, media, finance and human resources, among others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My suggestion is:** learn about NLP.** Try different data sources and techniques.
    Experiment, fail and improve yourself. This discipline will impact every possible
    industry, and we are likely to reach a level of advancement in the coming years
    that will blow our minds.
