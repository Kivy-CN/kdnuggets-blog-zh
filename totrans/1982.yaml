    architecture has evolved over the last decade or so. But has this evolution been
    significant enough? Most organizations typically have a **centralized data architecture**.
    Which, by design, consolidates data under a single umbrella, often managed by
    a dedicated data team.

    in the article "[How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data
    Mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html)" which outlines
    the principles and concepts behind the data mesh. This article and subsequent

    that departs from traditional centralized data models. It introduces a decentralized
    structure for organizing, distributing, and utilizing an organization's data assets.

    teams or data product teams, granting them autonomy in managing their data within
    their respective domains.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This decentralized approach aims to address the limitations associated with
    centralized data models, such as **scalability challenges, data silos, and slow
    response times to changing data needs**. By empowering domain-specific teams to
    independently manage their data, a data mesh promotes a culture of data autonomy,
    agility, and accountability within an organization. It also the efficient handling

    domains or business units within the organization**. Each domain is responsible
    for the data generated and used within its specific area of expertise or functionality.
    This principle recognizes that domain experts are best equipped to understand
    and manage the data within their respective domains.

    to the data source have a deep understanding of its context and can ensure its
    integrity. It also promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility for data,
    encouraging domain teams to maintain high data standards.
