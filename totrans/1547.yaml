- en: Predictive analytics is the analysis of present data to forecast and avoid problematic
    situations in advance. Manufacturers are deeply interested in monitoring the company
    functioning and its high performance. Finding the best possible way to hold problematic
    issues, overcoming difficulties or preventing them from happening at all are marvelous
    opportunities for the manufacturers using predictive analytics. The implementation
    of predictive analytics allows dealing with waste (overproduction, idle time,
    logistics, inventory, etc.). Therefore, let's concentrate on the possible solutions
    brought by predictive analytics.

    fails to perform the task. As a result, the secondary goal may be achieved  -
    to prevent these failures from happening or at least to reduce their number. This
    becomes possible due to the numerous predictive techniques.

    still working to lessen the likelihood of its failing. There are 2 major types
    of preventive maintenance: time-based and usage-based. The biggest strength of
    preventive maintenance is planning. Having at hand the prediction concerning future
    troubles with the equipment, the manufacturer may plan a break or a shut down
    for repairing. Such breaks are usually made to avoid considerable delays and failures,
    which are often caused by more significant problems that may arise.'

- en: Demand forecasting is a complex process involving analysis of data and massive
    work of the accountants and specialists. Moreover, it appears to have strong relations
    with inventory management. A simple fact may explain this interrelation - demand
    forecasting uses the data of the supply chain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a lot of benefits of demand forecasting for the manufacturers. First
    of all, it gives the opportunity to control inventory better and reduce the need
    to store significant amounts of useless products. Besides, the online inventory
    management software helps to collect data that may be of great use for further
    analysis. One more critical factor is that the data input for the demand forecasting
    may be continually updated. Thus, relevant forecasts may be made. Additional benefits
    lie in the improvement of the supplier-manufacturer relations, as both can efficiently
    regulate their stocks and supply process.

    among which are external factors like the economy or markets, raw material availability,
    etc. In this way, you can get a more complex view of your manufacturing business
    performance and further planning.

    factors and criteria influencing the product price. All the elements starting
    with the initial price of the raw material and up to the distribution costs contribute
    in the final product price. And what happens when the customer finds this price
    too high or too low?

    manufacturer and customer, not too high and not to low. Modern price optimization
    solutions can increase your profit efficiently. These tools aggregate and analyze
    pricing and cost data both from the internal sources and those of your competitors
    and derive optimized price variants.

    warranty claims. Warranty claims disclose valuable information on the quality
    and reliability of the product. They help to reveal early warnings or defects
    of the product.

    or develop new ones, more effective and efficient. Modern warranty analytics solutions
    help manufacturers to process vast volumes of warranty-related data from various
    sources and to apply this knowledge to discover where the warranty issues are
    rising and the reasons for their occurrence.

    manufacturing at the stage of quality control. In this respect object identification
    and object detection and classification proved to be very efficient. Usually,
    quality control monitoring was performed by people. However, now it is more common
    to rely on computer vision rather than on human vision. These monitoring systems
    usually consist of computer hardware and software, cameras, and lighting for image
    capturing. After that, these images are algorithmically compared to the standards
    to identify discrepancies.
