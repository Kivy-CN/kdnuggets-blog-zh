    fundamental skills like Statistics, Math, and Programming. Recently, however,
    I noticed through my own experiences that these fundamental skills can be hard
    to translate into practical skills that will make you employable.

    scientist, regardless of what you specialize in. The following skills (5–11) are
    all important skills but will vary in usage depending on what you specialize in.

    on inferential statistics. Conversely, if you’re more interested in text analytics,
    you might spend more time learning NLP, or if you’re interested in decision science,
    you might focus on explanatory modeling. You get the point.

    with over 95% accuracy. BUT if you can’t communicate the value of your projects
    to others, you won’t get the recognition that you deserve, and ultimately, you
    won’t be as successful in your career as you should.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    if you were to think about a picture book, the insights/models are the pictures
    and the “storytelling” refers to the narrative that connects all of the pictures.

    to be good at because you want to be able to build high-performing models. To

    learning models, but they were mission-critical models that had a significant

  prefs:

    because it wasn’t clear how these models derived their predictions based on their
    respective inputs. That’s now changing due to the widespread adoption of explainable
    machine learning techniques, like SHAP and LIME.
  prefs: []

    for each feature but also the impact on the model output, similar to the coefficients
    in a linear regression equation.

    one of the most practical applications in data science. Recommendation systems
    are so powerful because they have the ability to propel revenue and profits. In
    fact, [Amazon claimed to have boosted their sales by 29% due to their recommendation
    systems in 2019](https://rejoiner.com/resources/amazon-recommendations-secret-selling-online/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CJudging%20by%20Amazon%27s%20success%2C%20the,the%20same%20time%20last%20year.).
