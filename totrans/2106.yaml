    it locally on your laptop using API and Jan AI. We will also integrate it in VSCode
    to help us generate code, refactor it, document it, and generate testing units.
    We will be creating our own AI coding assistant for free.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The [Groq](https://groq.com/) LPU (Language Processing Unit) Inference Engine
    is designed to generate fast responses for computationally intensive applications
    with a sequential component, such as LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compared to CPU and GPU, LPU has greater computing capacity, which reduces the
    time it takes to predict a word, making sequences of text to be generated much
    faster. Moreover, LPU also deals with memory bottlenecks to deliver better performance
    on LLMs compared to GPUs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, Groq LPU technology makes your LLMs super fast, enabling real-time
    AI applications. Read the [Groq ISCA 2022 Paper](https://wow.groq.com/isca-2022-paper/)
    to learn more about LPU architecture.

    by far the most I have seen in my life. Even Azure AI or OpenAI cannot produce
