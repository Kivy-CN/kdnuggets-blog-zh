    they use data, specifically people analytics. Too many organizations invest resources
    into DEI without tangible goals to support their workers, which is where DEI is
    the most impactful for businesses that wish to make a change.

    and meaningful plans to work toward DEI goals by tracking metrics such as hiring,
    complaints, promotions, and other human resources measurements. For example, looking
    into hiring practices can reveal biases that inform relevant teams about why departments
    might not be as diverse.
