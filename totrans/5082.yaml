- en: We have released an initial version of [TheWalnut.io](http://thewalnut.io/),
    a web application which allows creating and sharing algorithm visualizations.
    We are going beyond just making a gallery of nice algorithm visualizations, to
    building the place where people can learn, talk and communicate visually about
    their code. There are many interesting features (and bug fixes) in our roadmap,
    but we wanted to release so you can already see what we are on.

- en: Walnut allows users to write programs in Python or Javascript, and make them
    interact with virtual “worlds” also designed by users. The worlds define shared
    state, possible actions, what part of the state is visible to each program, etc.
    It is possible to run single or multiple programs in a world, and then see the
    results. Then you can define, using a simple declarative DSL, how to represent
    the result of the execution (the actions that the program did, and both world
    and program state). You can have many different aspects of a single run with different
    visualizations.

    that defines that the state is a list of numbers, and that a program can see them
    and do swaps on them, with the goal of getting them in order. You can then add
    many programs that can play in that world (any swap-based sorting algorithm like [Quicksort](https://thewalnut.io/simulations/edit_agent/117/) or
    Shellsort). You can define [scenarios](https://thewalnut.io/simulations/edit_problem/109/) with
    initial data (to show average and worst cases, or different array sizes). The[ ](https://thewalnut.io/visualizer/visualize/3279/334/)[visualization](https://thewalnut.io/visualizer/visualize/3279/334/) then
    can map that information to a display: maybe just moving bars, or the call stack
    for a recursive algorithm like quicksort, or a plot of the widths of the swaps
    over time:'

- en: If you visit our Explore section you will be able to see as a starting point
    a few examples that were built by the developer team. But our vision is to have
    you create your own and share them. Learning algorithms only with code is hard!
    Crack the nut and let everyone see what’s inside! Join the Walnut revolution!
