  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Command Line (CLI), also known as the terminal or console, is a text-based
    interface that allows users to interact with a computer's operating system through
    the use of typed commands. It offers an alternative to graphical user interfaces
    (GUIs) and provides a more direct and precise way to access and manipulate files,
    directories, and system resources.
