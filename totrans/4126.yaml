    graduating from university. The programming classes I took in college were highly
    theoretical, and I was unable to apply the concepts I had learnt to solve real-world

    online course after online course and fail to put the concepts learnt into practice.
    Due to this, they are unable to solve real-world programming challenges, and cannot
    write a piece of code without the help of a tutorial.
  prefs: []

    only taking one or two programming online courses. You don’t need any more than
    that to learn the basics of coding.
