- en: '[AgentGPT web](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/) is an autonomous AI platform that
    enables users to easily build and deploy customizable autonomous AI agents directly
    in the browser. All you have to do is provide a name and objective for your AI
    agent, then watch as it sets out on an endeavor to achieve the goal you assigned.
    The agent will autonomously acquire knowledge, take actions, communicate, and
    adapt to accomplish its assigned aim.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AgentGPT operates through the chaining of language models, known as Agents,
    to accomplish specific objectives. The process involves an Agent deliberating
    on the most effective tasks to achieve a given goal, executing those tasks, assessing
    its performance, and continuously generating additional tasks.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT is an incredibly useful tool designed to provide accurate, specific
    answers to your questions and facilitate in-depth conversations. It goes beyond
    simply answering questions by helping sustain meaningful discussions on complex
    topics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AgentGPT, on the other hand, acts as a full-fledged platform for autonomous
    AI agents. You can give an agent the objective, and it will independently think,
    learn, and take action to achieve that goal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both AgentGPT and AutoGPT are impressive projects centered around autonomous
    AI agents. However, there are key differences. AgentGPT is a web-based platform
    that allows creating and deploying AI agents directly in the browser. AutoGPT,
    in contrast, is a locally-run tool that enables developing AI agents to perform
    tasks on their computers.
