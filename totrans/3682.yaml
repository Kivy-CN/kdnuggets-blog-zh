    one of the most complex data forms to work with. Have you ever thought that how
    voice assistants like Google Translate, Alexa, and Siri are able to understand,
    process, and respond to human commands? It is possible because of Natural Processing
    Language. NLP is the branch of data science that aims at making computers understand
    the semantics and analyze the textual data to extract meaningful insights from
    it. Some of the typical applications of Natural Language Processing are as follows:'

- en: Gensim is a Python library popularly known for topic modeling, document indexing,
    and similarity retrieval with large corpora. It offers pre-trained models for
    word embeddings that are used to identify the semantic similarity between the
    two documents. For instance, a pre-trained word2vec model can identify that “Paris”
    and “France” are related as Paris is the capital of France. The ability to identify
    such semantic relationships provides deep insights into the underlying meaning
    and context of data. The ability to process large inputs than the RAM available
    makes Gensim extremely effective.

    written in Java. It takes the raw human language as the input and can perform
    a wide variety of operations like POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, dependency
    parsing, and semantic analysis with just a few lines of code. Although it was
    originally designed for English, now it also supports numerous languages but is
    not limited to Arabic, French, German, Chinese, etc. Overall, it's a robust and
    reliable open-source tool for NLP tasks.

    pre-trained models that can be used to perform NLP tasks. These models are trained
    on vast amounts of data and can understand the underlying patterns in the textual
    data. Using pre-trained models saves the time and resources of the developer as
    compared to training their own models from scratch. Transformer models can also
    perform tasks like table question answering, optical character recognition, information
    extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.

    Although NLP tasks may seem a bit complicated at first with the right tools you
    can handle them really well. The above-mentioned list only refers to only the
    top libraries currently being used in NLP but there is much more out there that
    you can explore. I hope you learned something valuable from this article and I
    would really encourage you to try out these tools and build something cool.
