    in the process, and many challenges are faced along the way. A lot of companies
    see the need for data science, and it has been implemented in our lives today.
    However, some struggle with how to make use of their data analytics and which
    path to use to get there.

    The bigger your data, the longer it takes. It can typically take up to 50-80%
    of a data scientist's time to complete. The reason it takes so long is because
    data is never clean. You can be dealing with data that has inconsistencies, missing
    data,  incorrect labels, spelling mistakes, and more.

    in line with your business objective. The feature engineering phase consists of
    feature selection and feature construction.
  prefs: []

    add more noise to the data than actual valuable information. Having way too many
    features can lead to a curse of dimensionality, an increased complexity in the
    data for the model to easily and effectively learn from.

    process that flows through all the stages of a project. Each phase will need to
    be completed in order for the next phase to begin. There is no overlap between
    phases, making it an effective method as there are no clashes. If you have to
    revisit the previous phases, it means that the team has planned poorly.

    needs to be clear. This means that the objective is defined, the team knows the
    technology stack inside out, and the project elements are all in place to ensure
    a smooth and effective process.

    water? No. They require a lot of experimentation, requirement changes, and more.
    However, that does not mean that you cannot use elements of the waterfall methodology.
    Waterfall methodology requires a lot of planning. If you plan everything, yes
    you may still come across 1 or 2 problems on the way, but the challenges will
    be less and not as harsh on the process.

    a fast-paced, ever-changing technology industry. If you are a tech professional,
    you know that the requirements in a data science or software project change all
    the time. Therefore, having the right method in place which allows you to quickly
    adapt to these changes is important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it allows the team to continuously review the requirements of the project as it
    grows. Executives and data science managers can make decisions about changes that
    need to be made during the development process, rather than at the end once it's
    all complete.

    that helps to create structure in a team using a set of values, principles, and
    practices. For example, using Scrum, a data science project can break up its larger
    project into a series of smaller projects. Each of these mini-projects will be
    called a sprint and will consist of sprint planning to define objectives, requirements,
    responsibilities and more.

    where two or more methodologies are used to create a method that is entirely unique
    to the business. Companies can use hybrid methods for all types of projects, however,
    the reasoning behind it is down to product delivery.

    of production based on using sprints in an Agile method. So it seems like the
    company needs to do a bit more planning right? What method has a lot of planning?
    Yes, that’s right, Waterfall. The company can adopt waterfall into their method
    to cater specifically for the customer's requirement.

    a non-agile method such as Waterfall. These two methods can co-exist, however,
