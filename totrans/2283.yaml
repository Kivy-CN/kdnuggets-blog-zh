    to understand the pattern of sales, marketing, etc., which was being formulated
    by the vast data being available in the particular organization, people were more
    and more inclined to learn Machine learning and Data analysis than ever before
    and this urge is going to retain even post-pandemic.

    projects, you would have felt the thirst for an automated method that would have
    saved your time from the conceivable exhaustive process of tuning the billion
    of parameters followed by trying and testing the different models, which would
    adequately fit your training dataset.

    only automate the data handling stage but helps in choosing the relevant model
    for predictive analysis on the testing dataset.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, you can think of Automated machine learning as applying Machine
    Learning (ML) models to real-world problems by only initiating the process by
    running specific commands. Eventually, the rest of the work, pipelines, will be
    taken care of. Specifically, this process automates several steps in the general
    machine-learning pipeline, such as choosing the best model for our dataset, hyperparameter
    tuning using cross-validation, etc. Suppose we are curious about thinking of internal
    working. In that case, the tool will create different pipelines by choosing the
    different values of hyperparameters and then selecting the pipeline that provides
    better evaluation metrics on the test dataset.

    solutions can only automate algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning, whereas

    far inferior to those obtained with enterprise solutions.'

- en: H20, in my opinion, is the best open-source platform for democratizing machine
    learning. Its comprehensive scope and the H2O Flow web-based interface place it
    first among open-source solutions. I created a machine learning project for customer
    churn from the ground up without writing a single line of code.

    solution. While maintaining high control and understanding of the modeling, I
    quickly generated a model for customer churn that was better than the one from
    H20-3.
