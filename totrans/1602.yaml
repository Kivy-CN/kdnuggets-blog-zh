    can paint or color between the lines a Rembrandt or Leonardo da Vinci (we can
    talk later about the long-term impact of forcing kids to “stay between the lines”).

    design canvases.  A design canvas outlines what’s important given the subject
    area, and then allows the “painter” to color in the right information.  A design
    canvas is a one-page operational template that is designed to capture all of the
    different perspectives necessary for successful execution depending upon the problem
    being solved.  A great example of a canvas is the [Business Model Canvas](https://strategyzer.com/platform/resources)
    courtesy of Strategyzer (see Figure 1).

    off of the Business Model Canvas to flesh out the business use cases – or hypothesis
    – which is where we can become more effective at leveraging data and analytics
    to optimize our the business.  That next step involves the newly created Hypothesis
    Development canvas.

- en: The one area of under-invested in most data science projects is the thorough
    and comprehensive development of the hypothesis or use case that is being tested;
    that is, what it is we are trying to prove out with our data science engagement
    and how do we measure progress and success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address these requirements, we developed the Hypothesis Development Canvas
    – a “paint by the numbers” template that we will populate prior to executing a
    data science engagement to ensure that we thoroughly understand what we are trying
    to accomplish, the business value, how we are going to measure progress and success,
    what are the impediments and potential risks associated with the hypothesis.  The
    Hypothesis Development Canvas is designed to facilitate the business stakeholder-data
    science collaboration (see Figure 2).

    Learning Canvas](http://www.louisdorard.com/machine-learning-canvas/).”  Louis
    has made his canvas freely available, and I will do likewise with the additions
    that we made to his canvas based upon our unique data science requirements (see
    Figure 3).
