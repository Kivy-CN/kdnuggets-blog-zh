    compliance processes for major banks around the world. By implementing the different
    NLP techniques into the production processes, compliance departments can maintain
    detailed checks and keep up with regulator demands.

    credit, global market, retail, and more. All of these areas can benefit from document
    processing and the use of NLP techniques to get through the process more effectively.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several challenges that make the rules-based system more complicated
    to use when undergoing check routines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variability is one of these challenges. For instance, compliance document screening
    consists of large numbers of different types of documents, such as ID, bill of
    lading, tax notice, invoice, and more. This requires practical management and
    control methods in order to maintain the variability.
  prefs: []

- en: Named-Entity recognition also presents issues. Named Entity Recognition is a
    method that extracts information to locate and classify entities such as people,
    places, and more. Entities can appear different under different circumstances,
    making it difficult to correctly distinguish. For example, Teheran street is located
    in Paris, however, Teheran is the capital of Iran.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being able to differentiate every entity in a single document by looking at
    keywords is a lengthy task. The structure and format of the raw document can make
    it even more difficult; the number of pages, the data is presented in a table
    structure or the format is in a PDF.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditional NLP may not have the ability to catch synonyms or ambiguous entities,
    such as Orange which can be identified as a city, color, fruit, or more. Therefore,
    we need to take context into consideration to correctly identify and produce the
    right output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking at the diagram below, there are various sentences. The machine learning
    model uses Named-Entity recognition (NER) to identify and classify segments of
    the sentence. As you can see there are 4 different categories that can be used
    to classify the entities. These are Locations (LOC), Miscellaneous (MISC), Organizations
    (ORG), and Persons (PER).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if we take the first sentence “I heard that Paris Hilton stayed
    at the Hilton in Paris”. The Machine learning model would have some difficulty
    trying to distinguish the difference between ‘Hilton’ being classified as an Organisation
    and ‘Paris’ as a location, as it had learned that ‘Paris Hilton’ is a Person.
    Another difficulty for the model would be to distinguish is ‘Paris’ is considered
    a name or a city.

- en: Based on the model's knowledge base, it will have learned understanding of what
    entity is what through the training data. However, if the model has not learned
    these distinguishments in these entities, it would fail to produce the correct
    output. For example, if it had never classified ‘Paris’ as a Location before but
    has classified it as a Person, its past knowledge would tell it to classify it
    as a Person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, training the model on various amounts of data and changing the training
    data will improve the overall performance of it producing the correct entity categories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another challenge when using traditional NLP document screening is **increasing
    quality standards and changing regulations**. A rule-based system has does not
    have the ability to define patterns, therefore trying to identify complex non-compliance
    patterns in textual documents is a big challenge for traditional NLP.

- en: With the challenges faced by using manual or traditional NLP keyword-based screening,
    deep learning can solve the majority of these problems. Deep Learning is a subfield
    of machine learning, that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge.
    Deep Learning techniques have become very popular due to their state-of-the-art
    accuracy, which has recently exceeded human-level performance.

    Recognition on CoNLL from 2003 to 2020\. The [CoNLL 2003 NER task](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf)

    four different entity types (PER, LOC, ORG, MISC).

    that consists of two texts, where one is called the context, and the other is
    called the question. The end goal is to extract the answer by using the question
    from the text, if it is available or not. The F1 score is determined by the following
    formula: F1= 2*precision*recall/(precision+recall). A low F1 score indicates both
    poor precision and poor recall.'

    to 93.5 in 2019 with [CNN Large + fine-tune](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07785.pdf).
    The F1 score took a drastic growth in 2020 with the Primer NLX NER model achieving
    a 95.6% F1 accuracy score on CoNLL. This is a two-digit F1 score increase since
    the previously published [CNN Large and Fine-Tune](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07785.pdf)
    from Facebook AI Research. More importantly, the Primer NLX NER model is now on
    par with human-level performance.

    and works as a second line of defense. Deep Learning not only can identify, locate,
    and extract entities, it also have the ability to classify and categorize them.

- en: Banks have a lot of data and documents which they have stored from past screenings.
    These can benefit deep learning models by using them as input data to train on.
    Over time, neural networks can be iteratively improved upon and adjusted to continuously
    improve the compliance analysis process.
