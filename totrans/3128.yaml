    (using pure python, numpy, or even JS) and training these models on small datasets
    is a great way to learn how neural nets work. Invest time to gain valuable intuition
    before jumping onto frameworks. [https://t.co/biP02iWsjd](https://t.co/biP02iWsjd)

    have good intuition about them. A high school student playing with NN frameworks
    in 2018 can develop stronger understanding of NNs in a matter of days -- just
    thanks to a better application context

    telling students to go back to the start is not a good learning strategy in my

    got in on the conversation, including [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward)
    and [Emmanuel Ameisen](https://twitter.com/EmmanuelAmeisen) among others (Ha's
    original tweet was actually a response to something that [Denny Britz tweeted](https://twitter.com/dennybritz/status/961829329985400839),
    it should also be noted). Some good points were made on both "sides" of such an
    "argument."

    [TensorFlow Layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers), [Scikit
    Flow](https://terrytangyuan.github.io/2016/03/14/scikit-flow-intro/), [TensorFlow
    Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/estimators), among others
    -- kick abstraction up a notch. Theano and plain vanilla TensorFlow start seeming
    considerably more low-level in comparison. We can widen our scope even further
    and consider more general libraries like Scikit-learn; not long ago, such a well-rounded
    toolkit of algorithms which includes a wide variety of helpful implementations
    under a single roof, with a consistent API, would have been been nearly unimaginable,
    to say nothing of its convenient level of abstraction.

- en: Implementing machine learning models becomes much more easily realized with
    such libraries. But do the standard fit/predict API of Scikit-learn or the simplicity
    of stacking sequential layers with Keras go too far up the abstraction totem pole
    for newcomers to genuinely appreciate the underlying theory of the algorithms?
    Or do they free practitioners from the trouble of having to code the functionality
    they may well (or may not) understand perfectly fine?

- en: This technology abstraction conversation could just as easily be had about programming
    languages as machine learning, or even about the concept of abstraction more generally.
    It's true that an [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
    is not the usual programming weapon of choice these days, with coders generally
    arming themselves with something further up the abstraction stack, and that the
    idea of what constitutes [high-level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)
    evolves over time.

- en: I would argue, however, that it's also true that someone picking up Javascript
    on their own while coding haphazardly without a computer science foundation is
    not the same as a computer science graduate student with a firm CS base (or someone
    without formal CS education but a firm grasp of its underpinnings) venturing out
    to implement their ideas using the same language. I don't believe this is the
    same argument that Chollet is making (he never states that people without an understanding
    of neural networks would be able to effectively code them), but he is almost certainly
    promoting a steady ascension of the abstraction stack as the more valid learning
    experience.

- en: While "best" approaches to learning, especially their differing nuances, will
    never be fully-generalizable and always dependent in part on the learner, it seems
    reasonable that a progressive hybrid approach combining both theory and practice
    can't be excluded from consideration as a go-to choice for learning neural networks
    and their implementation. Again, nuance matters, but some balance of keeping theory
    from tripping up practice, and vice versa, and avoiding a theory front-loaded
    program preventing learners from being motivated by seeing (and doing) deep learning
    in action early on seems advantageous. This seems rather like the approach [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
    has taken, an approach which could also confirm the validity of projects like
    Keras early on as ways to try stuff out quickly as a starter, as well as how to
    get stuff done even after you have built some stronger understanding.
