    (LLMs) being at the forefront of everything tech-related. You have LLMs such as
    [ChatGPT](/chatgpt-vs-bard), [Gemini](/chatgpts-new-rival-googles-gemini), and
    more.

    someone else's computer. For something to be run elsewhere, you can imagine how
    expensive it is. Because if it was so cheap, why not run it locally on your own
    computer?

- en: Your first step is to download LM Studio for Mac, Windows, or Linux, which you
    can do [here](https://lmstudio.ai/). The download is roughly 400MB, therefore
    depending on your internet connection, it may take a whole.

- en: Your next step is to choose a model to download. Once LM Studio has been launched,
    click on the magnifying glass to skim through the options of models available.
    Again, take into consideration that these models with be large, therefore it may
    take a while to download.
