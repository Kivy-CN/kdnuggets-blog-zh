    expensive and talent demanding. And, if you’re aiming at building another Netflix
    recommendation system, it really is. But the trend of making everything-as-a-service
    has affected this sophisticated sphere, too. You can jump-start an ML initiative
    without much investment, which would be the right move if you are new to data
    science and just want to grab the low hanging fruit.
