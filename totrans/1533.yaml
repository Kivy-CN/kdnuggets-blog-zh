- en: In my very [first article on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/my-journey-from-physics-into-data-science-5d578d0f9aa6),
    I mentioned the importance of building a portfolio. Having a well-polished resume
    is not enough to get you an interview without a good portfolio.

- en: After the first glance at your resume, prospective employers want to understand
    more about your background and this is where your portfolio comes in. While you
    might wonder how to build a portfolio from scratch, start by **documenting your
    learning journey**. Share your learning experience, mistakes, takeaways — technical
    or non-technical — through social media platforms (LinkedIn, Medium, Facebook,
    Instagram, Personal blog — it doesn’t matter).

    videos (interview with other aspiring/well-established data scientists) and share
    on YouTube. **Good at writing?** Then start writing on the topics that you’re
    passionate about on different platforms. If you are not into visuals and writing,
    then **reach out to others and conduct podcasts** with them.'

    community on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/admond1994/) and document
    my learning journey on [Medium](https://medium.com/@admond1994). I learned the
    most on LinkedIn with the close-knit data science community in such a conducive
    sharing-learning environment.

    with my experiences from different sources. Along the way, I got messages from
    different recruiters on job opportunities and I even got the chance to grab some
    coffee and have quick chat with some of them!
