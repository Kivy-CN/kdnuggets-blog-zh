    beginning with a broad base of physiological needs such as food and shelter, rising
    through social needs, and capping off with creativity and self-realization.

    is right. Having worked with data engineers and data scientists in companies large
    and small, here’s how I would describe a data team’s hierarchy of needs for data
    quality, starting at the ground floor with data freshness, where we determine
    whether or not we have the data we need in the first place.

    it produce the same data as a previous run? To check for stale data, one must
    proceed carefully and extensively to identify stuck data feeds. It’s easy to detect
    that nothing has updated, but in many cases, a sequence number or timestamp movement
    doesn’t mean that the rest of the data has moved.

    with data teams, I’ve seen a number of approaches for tracking this, from using
    JSON data stored in string fields to using sub-record data types in systems that
    support it, such as BigQuery. There are many considerations when deciding an approach,
    but the key areas of interest usually are focused on missing data columns or critical
    fields.'

- en: For typeness checking, my advice is to proceed with caution. Many strings in
    dev and production environments are actually dates or numbers. You might want
    to consider “promoting” types to what their best representation should be. This
    means that on a mixed type field, you’ll build a model for numeric values separate
    from strings, if applicable.

    new types of strings without being hung up on simple questions like whether the
    value is null, or the string length.

- en: 'In past lives of building data pipelines, I’ve run into the question this over
    and over. My solution was to augment the data with fields explaining the reasoning,
    where I could embed a variety of meta data: a human-readable explanation, a script
    file name and line number, other variables, or whatever I would need to debug
    the issue later. “I’ve marked this as out of stock because two data sources said
    it is out of stock even though our third data source says we have 1,000” is a
    very useful thing to have when examining a single record.'

- en: Not everyone has the luxury of appending significant metadata, but if you can
    do it, you should. And if you’re considering tools that can automatically find
    issues with the data fields, note that these same tools can analyze your new metadata
    fields, too, just leading to metadata alerts that can alert you to new behavior
    behind the scenes, if desired.

- en: Something to keep in mind here is that this hierarchy really is a hierarchy.
    Everything begins with data freshness. If the data you’re analyzing in all the
    upper levels of the hierarchy is stale, you’ll have a false sense of confidence
    about the quality of your data. You’ll think today’s data is great, when you’re
    really repeating your analysis of last Wednesday’s data.
  prefs: []

    data, that you understand its schemas, and so on.
  prefs: []

- en: I recommend that data teams make sure they have tooling in place for each of
    these layers and that they can track them separately. Then, when all the layers
    are reporting solid results, you’ll know that you’ve met all the needs in your
    hierarchy. For a busy data team, that’s a kind of transcendence of its own. Even
    Maslow would be pleased.
