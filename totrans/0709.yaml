- en: As the world of data grows, so does the world of data science. To keep up with
    the data science world is a full-time job in itself. The market is ever-growing
    and tools are developing and dropping into the market causing chaos. And then
    you have the problem of learning these new tools, understanding their full potential,
    what can it replace or if it’s just another add-on.

    most probably be Python. It’s a gold standard, with the largest data science user
    base. A lot of data science tools are written using Python and the community is
    the largest, fastest growing and most active. You’ll be silly not to have this
    in your toolbox!

    makes sense! They are the building blocks of machine learning algorithms. They
    help you understand a problem and allow you to use them to find a solution. From
    identifying patterns to outputting desired results from large complex data sets,
    data scientists can extract insights and reliably interpret results using maths
    and statistics.

    pretty! But also remember that other stakeholders may not be highly technically
    inclined therefore visualisations are important to them. It’s how they understand
    data science. Being able to visualise your insights in various ways will help
    you better communicate them without having to do much talking.

    for managing data in a relational database. As a data scientist, you will be managing
    a lot of databases and SQL is your key to combing through the data. With SQL,
    you will be able to work with structured data stored in databases in which you
    can easily extract, manipulate, and analyse data. You may want to learn primarily
    Python or SQL, or you may want to be untouchable and learn both!

    prominent in our day-to-day lives. It is also important that there are tools and
    software that developers can use to ensure the pipeline is accurate and effective
    from start to finish. Frameworks provide a flexible range of software components

    in the data science world, for example, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, Keras and
    more. As a data scientist, you must learn all of these frameworks as they could
    be beneficial to you at different times.
