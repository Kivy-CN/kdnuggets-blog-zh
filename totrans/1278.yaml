    making to the next level. We are charged with building automated systems that
    have the intelligence, context, and empowerment to make decisions with a business
    impact in the tens of millions of euros per year.

    used by the business is even harder. Let’s go through what it takes at Picnic
    to productize our data science projects, a term we’re affectionately coining ‘**Data
    Science as a Product**’.

- en: A study from July 2019 found that [87% of data science projects don’t make it
    to production](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/).
    There are numerous reasons cited; everything from lack of support from leadership,
    siloed data sources, and lack of collaboration. Beyond these issues, there are
    inherent aspects that make data science and machine-learning projects different
    from other software development.
  prefs: []

- en: First, data science, and especially machine learning, lives in the world of
    probabilities and uncertainties. A typical output of a machine learning-based
    payment fraud model would be along the lines of, ‘*the probability of this order
    being fraudulent is 73% +/- 5% with a 95% confidence interval’.* Our counterparts
    on the business side live in a determinist world, ‘*we want to block all fraudulent
    orders’*. Translating between these worlds is not an easy task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, there is a non-linearity in data science projects that (usually)
    doesn’t occur in ‘traditional’ software development. We don’t know how well a
    model will perform before we start building it. It can take a week, three months,
    or it may not be possible to get an acceptable level of performance. This makes
    it very difficult to put together a nice project plan with timelines and deliverables
    that the business wants to see.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the importance of model trust is hard to overstate when releasing a
    model to production. When working with the business to productionalize a model,
    we are entering a domain in which they are the experts. In many cases, we are
    looking to automate a manual process or replace a set of carefully crafted business
    rules. While these rules aren’t perfect, they were built by those with a deep
    understanding of the business. Handing off a black-box machine learning algorithm
    and telling the business that it is going to replace their current way of working
    is a challenging task. In the end, it’s the business that owns the profit/loss
    from whatever process the model is looking to automate, and we as data scientists
    need to convince them to put their livelihood in the hands of our models.

    Well, it might turn out that the business needs to be able to update their forecasts
    throughout the day. All of a sudden, you need a real-time service. Your model
    performs well on a majority of the articles/segments/regions, but a new product
    is launching this quarter. Now your model is making predictions with no historical
    data (the [cold start problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(recommender_systems)) says

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    output? How will the predictions be consumed? What happens if the model doesn’t

    discussions, and late nights reworking when you know the answer to these questions
    before you start development.

    want, but if the first few predictions your model makes happen to be incorrect,
    will it be given a chance to recover? The basic business rules that were previously
    in place weren’t great, but the business knew which cases it worked well and when
    it didn’t, then could intervene accordingly. Your models (hopefully) have an operational
    impact, and if the business doesn’t trust them, then they won’t be used. Simple
    as that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Discussions on model trust are uncomfortable but essential. You need to understand
    upfront what it will take for the business to be able to use your model in production.
    At the very least, an evaluation period with performance metrics needs to be decided
    and signed off on by both parties.

- en: Agile development has become the de facto standard for software development
    but hasn’t made its way to the data science world (yet). Data science projects
    today tend to happen with the ‘build it and they will come’ mentality. A data
    scientist meets with the business on the problem, decides what metric to optimize,
    and asks how they can get access to the data. Then they go off and spend a few
    months building a beautiful, robust model and present the finished product. And
    then…

    You build the data pipeline, start with a basic baseline model (also known as
