- en: If you want to get a job in data science and you didn’t get a degree in computer
    science, data science, or mathematics the first time around, you might be looking
    at your options now. You could go back to school to get that degree, or you could
    try to complete an accredited data science course or bootcamp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both are expensive and time consuming, but degrees are an order of magnitude
    *more* expensive and time consuming than most courses or bootcamps. Is that price
    tag worth it to employers? Let’s break it down by what each kind of curriculum
    offers.

- en: '**The Traditional Path: Data Science Degrees**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard route is to get a degree (or even two) in data science, computer
    science, or mathematics. This kind of structured learning will teach you what
    you need to know to perform well at a data science job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the benefits of a degree is that it lets you learn the subject solidly
    and comprehensively. It offers real depth and a profound understanding of theoretical
    concepts you wouldn’t get from an intensive bootcamp or online course.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Degrees cover a wide and deep range of themes, including topics like advanced
    mathematics, statistics, computer science fundamentals, data structures, algorithms,
    machine learning, data visualization, and perhaps even specialized areas like
    artificial intelligence, deep learning, and big data technologies which have become
    more applicable in recent years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The benefit of going this broad as well as this deep means that you really understand
    the fundamentals. You’re not just a code monkey; you understand how and when to
    use specific statistical tools or run particular analyses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only that, but a degree carries weight. Many universities are like name
    brands employers recognize and admire. A job candidate with a mathematics degree
    from MIT, for example, stands out in a positive way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, as I’ve mentioned, a degree is normally four years, though there are
    shorter, more focused options available. For instance, if four years is too long,
    you could opt for an accelerated program or a master's degree specializing in
    data science, which typically spans one to two years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These alternatives are kind of like a speed-run of college degrees, offering
    a more concentrated curriculum with a focus on what you’d need in the job – data
    science, machine learning, and statistics skills. They can be an attractive alternative
    for folks who already graduated and want to pivot into data science jobs now without
    spending four years to do so.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you may know, the data science field is robust and growing (nope, [no bubble](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/data-science-in-2024-what-has-changed/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+ds+degrees+vs+courses)).
    The number of graduates in those fields is not matching up to the number of job
    openings. That means that while it’s certainly not easy to get a job without a
    degree, it’s also not impossible – employers just want you to prove your skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to do that is through a combination of online courses, certificates,
    and bootcamps. This path is more flexible. You can even do it part-time, alongside
    an existing job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compared to standard degrees, the curriculum in these programs is more practical,and
    designed with the current demands of the job market in mind. They include hands-on
    projects that approximate real data science work, teaching the specific skills
    that you might see on standard job descriptions, like proficiency in Python, R,
    machine learning algorithms, and data visualization tools. This approach can be
    especially useful for anyone who prefers direct application versus sitting in
    lecture halls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many bootcamps run for just a couple of months, often with some kind of job
    placement offer at the end. They are expensive, sometimes running into the tens
    of thousands of dollars, but if they can help you land a six-figure job in under
    a year, that can have a high ROI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is that this route doesn’t give you the whole, holistic picture.
    You might be able to stuff your resume with great portfolio projects but stumble
    in the interview because you get asked about a basic fundamental question the
    bootcamp didn’t cover.

    auditing (or paying for) Coursera or EdX courses, or doing your own learning,
    research, and practice alongside.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Degrees definitely offer unmatched depth and prestige. But the agility and practical
    skills acquired through courses, and bootcamps are not only a worthy alternative
    but might actually make you better prepared for the job market. Degrees, while
    traditional, also have more inertia – courses and bootcamps can change things
    up much faster in response to evolving job markets than a degree can. Plus, the
    focus is on theory with less emphasis on skills like interview prep.

    a great option, so long as you supplement your deep theoretical knowledge with

    you fully grasp the concepts.
