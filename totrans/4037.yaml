    pretty sure most of you might have already experienced the agony of sitting for
    hours while our Pandas try to deal with big DataFrames.

    miss the buzz around Polars, a robust dataframe library specifically developed
    to assess large datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So today I will try to delve into the key technical distinctions between these
    two dataframe libraries, examining their respective strengths and limitations.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First things first, why all this obsession to compare Pandas and Polars libraries?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Distinct from other libraries tailored for large datasets, like Spark or Ray,
    Polars is uniquely crafted for single-machine use, leading to frequent comparisons
    with pandas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet, Polars and pandas diverge significantly in their approach to data handling
    and their ideal use cases.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Rust boosted efficiency
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In stark contrast to Pandas, which is grounded in Python libraries like NumPy,
    Polars is built using Rust. This low-level language, renowned for its rapid performance,
    can be compiled into machine code without the use of an interpreter.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such a foundation provides Polars with a substantial advantage, particularly
    in managing data types that are challenging for Python.
  prefs: []

- en: 2\. Eager and lazy execution options
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pandas follows an eager execution model, processing operations as they are coded,
    while Polars provides both eager and lazy execution options.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Polars uses a query optimizer in its lazy execution to efficiently plan and
    potentially reorganize the order of operations, eliminating any unnecessary steps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is in contrast to Pandas, which might process an entire DataFrame before
    applying filters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, in calculating the mean of a column for certain categories, Polars
    would first apply the filter and then perform the group-by operation, optimizing
    the process for efficiency.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “To provide a lightning-fast DataFrame library that utilizes all available cores
    on your machine.”
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another benefit of Rust's design is its support for safe concurrency, ensuring
    predictable and efficient parallelism. This feature enables Polars to fully utilize
    a machine's multiple cores for complex.

    operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Expressive APIs
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Polars boasts a highly versatile API, enabling virtually all desired tasks to
    be executed using its methods. In comparison, performing intricate tasks in pandas
    frequently requires using the apply method coupled with lambda expressions within
    its apply method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This approach, however, has a downside: it iteratively processes each row of
    the DataFrame, performing the operation sequentially.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conversely, Polars' capability to utilize inherent methods facilitates operations
    at the column level, leveraging a distinct parallelism type known as SIMD (Single
    Instruction, Multiple Data).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As always, it mainly depends on the use case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main advantage that Polars has over Pandas lies in its speed, particularly
    with large datasets. For those handling extensive data processing tasks, exploring
    Polars is highly recommended.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Polars excels in data transformation efficiency, it falls short in areas
    like data exploration and integration into machine learning pipelines, where Pandas
    remains superior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Polars' incompatibility with most Python data visualization and machine learning
    libraries, such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, limits its applicability in these
    fields.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's an ongoing discussion about integrating the Python dataframe interchange
    protocol across these packages to support diverse dataframe libraries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This development could streamline data science and machine learning processes,
    currently reliant on Pandas, but it's a relatively new concept and will require
    time for implementation.

    our workflows, allowing us to leverage the best of both worlds in our data-driven
    endeavors.
  prefs: []
