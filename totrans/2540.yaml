    yet ML models are the most susceptible to the changing dynamics of a digital landscape.
    ML models are defined and optimized by the variables and parameters available
    at the time period in which they are created.

- en: Let us look at the case of an **[ML model](https://www.sigmoid.com/ebooks-whitepapers/ml-models-poc-to-production/)** created
    to track spam emails based on a generalized template of spam emails that may have
    been proliferating at the time. With this baseline in place, the ML model is able
    to identify and stop these sorts of emails, thus preventing potential phishing
    attacks. However, as the threat landscape changes and cybercriminals become smarter,
    more sophisticated and realistic emails have replaced the old ones. When faced
    with these newer hacking attempts, ML detection systems operating on variables
    from prior years will be ill-equipped to classify these new threats properly.
    This is just one example of Model Drift.

- en: Model Drift (or model decay) is the degradation of an ML model’s predictive
    ability. Caused by changes in the digital environment, and the subsequent changes
    in variables such as concept and data, model drift is prominent in ML models simply
    by the nature of the machine language model as a whole.

- en: The assumption that all future variables will remain the same as those that
    were prevalent when the ML model was created is a fertile breeding ground for **[model
    drift in MLOps](https://www.sigmoid.com/machine-learning-operationalization-mlops/)**.

    its performance shouldn’t degrade as the data predicted is coming from the same
    distribution which was used during training. However, if the model exists in a
    constantly changing and dynamic environment, involving too many variables, then
    the model performance is expected to differ as well.

    in either the variables or the predictors: Concept drift and Data Drift respectively.'

- en: 1. **Concept Drift** – When the statistical attributes of target variables in
    a model change, concept drift occurs. Simply put, if the very nature of the model’s
    variables change then the model cannot function as intended.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2. **Data Drift** – The most common type of model drift, occurs when the statistical
    properties of certain predictors change. As the variables change, the model is
    subject to failure as a result. A model that might work during one time period
    might not see the same efficacy when applied to a different environment, simply
    because the data is not tailored to the changing variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the tussle between concept drift vs data drift, upstream data changes also
    play a prominent role in model drift. As all the requisite data moves through
    a **[data pipeline](https://www.sigmoid.com/etl-and-data-warehousing/)**, features
    not being generated and changes in units (such as measurements) can also lead
    to missing values which will hamper ML model operations.

- en: Early detection of model drift is critical when it comes to maintaining model
    accuracy. This is because the model accuracy decreases as time passes and the
    predicted values continue to deviate further from the actual ones. The further
    this process goes, the more irreplaceable damage is done to the model as a whole.
    Hence, catching the problem early on is essential. The F1 score, where both the
    precision and recall capabilities of the model are evaluated for their accuracy
    is a quick way to detect if anything is awry.

- en: 'Similarly, based on the model’s purpose, a variety of other metrics will matter
    depending on the situation. An ML model designed for medical usage will require
    a different set of metrics when compared to an ML model designed for business
    operations. However, the end result is the same: whenever a specified metric drops
    below a set threshold, then there’s a high chance that model drift is happening.'

- en: However, in several cases measuring the accuracy of a model isn’t possible –
    particularly when there is difficulty in getting the predicted and actual data,
    which remains one of the major **[challenges in scaling ML models](https://www.sigmoid.com/blogs/5-challenges-to-be-prepared-for-before-scaling-machine-learning-models/)**.
    In this case, refitting models based on past experiences can help to create a
    predictive timeline for when drift might occur in a model. With this in mind,
    the models can be redeveloped at regular intervals to deal with an impending model
    drift.

    new models can be created that will improve and correct the predictions of the
    previous baseline model.

- en: However, when the data changes with time, weighing data based on current changes
    can be important. By ensuring that the models give more weight to recent data
    changes, vs less weight to older ones, the ML model will become more robust and
    build a neat little database to manage potential future drift-related changes.

    in a timely manner. Whether it is through scheduled model retraining or through
    real-time **[machine learning](https://www.sigmoid.com/blogs/5-best-practices-for-putting-ml-models-into-production/)**;
    creating a sustainable machine learning model is a challenge in and of itself.

- en: However, the advent of MLOps has simplified the process of retraining models
    more often and within shorter intervals. It has enabled data teams to automate
    the model retraining and the most surefire approach to trigger the process is
    by scheduling. With automated retraining, companies can fortify the existing data
    pipeline with new and fresh data within a specific time frame. The good thing
    is that it doesn’t require any specific code changes or rebuilding of the pipeline.
    If a company, however, discovers a new feature or algorithm which was not previously
    available during model training, then including it while deploying the retrained
    model can significantly enhance model accuracy.

- en: When deciding the frequency with which models need to be retrained, there are
    several variables to consider. Sometimes waiting for the problem to show itself
    becomes the only real option (particularly if there is no past history to work
    with going forward). In other situations, models should be retrained based on
    patterns tied to seasonal changes in variables. What remains constant in this
    sea of change, however, is the importance of monitoring. Regardless of schedules
    or the business domains; constant monitoring at regular intervals is and always
    will be the best way to detect model drift.
