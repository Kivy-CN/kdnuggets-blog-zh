    life of a Data Scientist. Every time we start exploring a new dataset, we need
    to first do an [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://towardsdatascience.com/interactive-data-visualization-167ae26016e8) in
    order to get a feeling of what are the main characteristics of certain features.
    If we are able to understand if it’s present any pattern in the data distribution,
    we can then tailor-made our Machine Learning models to best fit our case study.
    In this way, we will be able to get a better result in less time (reducing the
    optimization steps). In fact, some Machine Learning models are designed to work
    best under some distribution assumptions. Therefore, knowing with which distributions
    we are working with, can help us to identify which models are best to use.

    a **population**. Using this sample, we can then try to understand it’s main patterns
    so that we can use it to make predictions on the whole population (even though
    we never had the opportunity to examine the whole population).

    we might be able to make quite accurate predictions of the house price in any
    other city in the USA (our population).

    plays a really important role. If we know their values, we can then easily find
    out the probability of predicting exact values by just examining the probability
    distribution (Figure 8). In fact, thanks to the distribution properties, 68% of
    the data lies within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard
    deviations of the mean and 99.7% within three standard deviations of the mean.
