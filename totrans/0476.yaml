    background. It can be confusing sometimes. It makes it difficult to know whether
    you’re over-or underqualified for a job. Sometimes, companies have overlapping
    job descriptions, or even their own specific understanding (and names) of what
    tasks a job should cover doesn’t help.

    different data science job titles that require a data science background. Because
    many of these data science jobs require the same or very similar skills, we’ll
    start off by talking about the similarities between the jobs. We’ll also cover
    what qualifications and data science skills you need to land a job, as well as
    the example interview questions you could expect. Then we’ll talk about some specifics
    of the job description, technical skills, and the career trajectory, including
    the salaries.

    It involves programming skills combined with mathematical and/or statistical knowledge
    and with business domain expertise. From this definition, we can answer where
    do the data scientists usually come from.

    statistics, economics, or any similar quantitative field. For some data science
    jobs, a degree in a humanistic field could also be nice to have, especially if
    the job is more people-behavior-oriented.

    various data science jobs. However, there are some skills that you need to have
    for virtually every job that requires a data science background. The only difference
    is to what extent you’ll use that skill at your job.

    skills to gain insights from data. They will gather, organize, clean, and analyze
    data. This part is the same as with data analysts. However, they are more forward-looking
    and prediction-oriented. They will use the data to build the machine learning
    models. They help them make predictions by finding trends, patterns, and behaviors
    in the available data. They do it to solve business problems and increase the
    company’s performance in terms of sales, clients’ experience, costs, revenue,
    etc.

    to some business problems. Data analysts are usually required to visualize data

    analysts are using data to describe past and present, while data scientists use
    it to predict the future.

    Its purpose is to transform data into an “analyzable” format and make such data
    available to data scientists and data analysts. That means they have to gather,
    maintain, manipulate, and load data for others to use. Data engineers are more
    focused on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data than data analysts
    and data scientists.

- en: Compared to data modeler and database administrator, the data architect is a
    data science job title that requires a high-level point of view. The data architect’s
    job is to have in mind the company’s business needs and develop the complete architecture
    of data management. This doesn’t involve just databases but laying out the framework
    for how the data will be collected, used, modeled, retrieved, secured. In general,
    this means providing an architecture that will be there from the point data enters
    the company to the point it leaves it.

- en: This data science job title is relatively similar to a data engineer. The main
    difference is they are usually not concerned with data infrastructure, like data
    engineers. Instead, they build software on top of this data infrastructure, which
    allows the end-users to use the underlying data and data infrastructure.

    it's focused only on the statistics part of the data scientist job. They, too,
    analyze data, apply statistical methods to data, and identify patterns and trends
    that will provide business insight and support decision-making.

    analyses and models, the company will decide on its investments, FX and equity

    Data Science job titles we gave you is not an ultimate list because the new data
    science job types are being created almost daily. It also depends on the company’s
    organization and size how they will call a certain position. This can mean merging
    several job types into one or breaking down one job type into several sub-types
    and specializations, all performed by several people.
