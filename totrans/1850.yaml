    data scientists spend 80% of their time with data preparation. That is their JOB!
    If you are not good at data preparation, you are NOT a good data scientist. It
    is not a [janitor](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0)
    problem as Steve Lohr provoked. The validity of any analysis is resting almost
    completely on the preparation. The algorithm you end up using is close to irrelevant.Complaining
    about data preparation is the same as being a farmer and complaining about having
    to do anything but harvesting and please have somebody else deal with the pesky
    watering, fertilizing, weeding, etc.'

    data collection. Designing a system that collects data in a form that is useful
    and easily digestible by data science is a high art. Providing full transparency
    to DS how exactly the data flows to the system is another. It involves processes
    that consider sampling, data annotation, matching, etc. It does not include things
    like replacing missing value and excessive normalization. Creating an effective
    data environment for DS needs to involve DS and cannot be entirely owned by engineering.
    DS is often NOT able to spec such system requirements in sufficient detail to
    allow for a clean handover.

    by far biggest issue I see is data science solving irrelevant problems. This is
    a huge waste of time and energy. The reason is typically that whoever has the
    problem is lacking data science understanding to even express the issue and data
    scientists end up solving whatever they understood might be be the problem, ultimately
    creating a solution that is not really helpful (and often far too complicated).
    A typical category are ‘underdefined’ tasks: “Find actionable insights in this
    dataset!”. Well - most data scientists do not know which actions can be taken.
    They also do not know what insights are trivial vs. interesting. So there is really
    no point sending them on a wild goose chase.'

- en: The “solving the wrong problem” is pervasive in part because the data science
    is not sufficiently involved in the decision process (thanks to Meta for asking
    me to clarify). Now - not EVERY data scientist can and should be expected to be
    able to shape the problem as well as the solution (back to the unicorn problem),
    but at least one data scientist on the team should. The bigger issue is however
    not the lack of ability/willingness from the data science side (although indeed
    there are plenty who just like to solve a cute problem, not matter how relevant)
    - but often a corporate culture where analytics, IT, etc is considered an ‘execution’
    function. Management decides what is needed and everybody else goes and does it.

    data understanding, data intuition, and finally skepticism as most limiting factors
    to efficiency. What makes these factors contribute to inefficiency is NOT that
    it takes longer get to an answer (in fact lack of the three typically leads to
    results much more quickly) but rather how long it takes to a (almost) right answer.
