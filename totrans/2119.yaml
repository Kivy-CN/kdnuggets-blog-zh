    computer scientist and AI researcher known for his work on deep learning and neural
    networks. He played a key role in the development of ChatGPT at OpenAI and was
    previously the Sr. Director of AI at Tesla. Even before that, he designed and
    was the primary instructor for the first deep learning class [Stanford - CS 231n:
    Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2016/).
    The class became one of the largest at Stanford and has grown from 150 enrolled
    in 2015 to 750 students in 2017\. I highly recommend anyone interested in deep
    learning to watch this on YouTube. I will not go into more detail about him, and
    we will shift our focus toward one of his most popular talks on YouTube which
    crossed **1.4 million views** "Introduction to Large Language Models." This talk
    is a busy-person introduction to LLMs and is a must-watch for anyone interested
    in LLMs.'

    and the potential risks associated with their use. It has been divided into 3
    major parts that are as follows:'

    In this part, Andrej discusses the Llama 2-70b model specifically. It is one of
    the largest LLMs with 70 billion parameters. The model consists of two main components:
    the parameters file and the run file. The parameters file is a large binary file
    that contains the weights and biases of the model. These weights and biases are
    essentially the "knowledge" that the model has learned during training. The run
    file is a piece of code that is used to load the parameters file and run the model.
    The training process of the model can be divided into the following two stages:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Pretraining
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This involves collecting a large chunk of text, about 10 terabytes, from the
    internet, and then using a GPU cluster to train the model on this data. The result
    of the training process is a base model that is the lossy compression of the internet.
    It is capable of generating coherent and relevant text but not directly answering
    questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Finetuning
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pre-trained model is further trained on a high-quality dataset to make it
    more useful. This results in an assistant model. Andrej also mentions a third
    stage of fine-tuning, which involves using comparison labels. Instead of generating
    answers from scratch, the model is given multiple candidate answers and asked
    to choose the best one. This can be easier and more efficient than generating
    answers, and can further improve the model's performance. This process is called
    reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

    the following key points are discussed:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Scaling Law
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model performance correlates with two variables—the number of parameters and
    the amount of training text. Larger models trained on more data tend to achieve
    better performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Usage of Tools
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs like ChatGPT can utilize tools such as a browser, calculator, and Python
    libraries to perform tasks that would otherwise be challenging or impossible for
    the model alone.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. System One and System Two Thinking in LLMs
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Currently, LLMs predominantly employ system one thinking—fast, instinctive,
    and pattern-based. However, there is interest in developing LLMs capable of engaging
    in system two thinking—slower, rational, and requiring conscious effort.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. LLM OS
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs can be thought of as the kernel process of an emerging operating system.
    They can read and generate text, have extensive knowledge on various subjects,
    browse the internet or reference local files, use existing software infrastructure,
    generate images and videos, hear and speak, and think for extended periods using
    system 2\. The context window of an LLM is analogous to RAM in a computer, and
    the kernel process tries to page relevant information in and out of its context
    window to perform tasks.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Jailbreak
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Attempts to bypass safety measures in LLMs to extract harmful or inappropriate
    information. Examples include role-playing to deceive the model and manipulating
    responses using optimized sequences of words or images.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Prompt Injection
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Involves injecting new instructions or prompts into an LLM to manipulate its
    responses. Attackers can hide instructions within images or web pages, leading
    to the inclusion of unrelated or harmful content in the model's answers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Data Poisoning /Backdoor Attack/Sleeper Agent Attack
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Involves training a large language model on malicious or manipulated data containing
    trigger phrases. When the model encounters the trigger phrase, it can be manipulated
    to perform undesirable actions or provide incorrect predictions.
