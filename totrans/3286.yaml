    learning has shown a steady (almost threefold) increase in interest since 2015\.
    Coursera and Udacity machine learning courses are both in the top ten related
    topics. It appears that many people want to learn more about it.

    with machine learning (ML). It has become an important component in online retail,
    recommendation systems, fraud detection and others. Open source machine learning and data
    science tools such as [Python’s Scikit-learn package](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
    are freely available, very powerful and often used to build these tools.

- en: In the past, ML learning hasn't had as much success in cyber security as in
    other fields. Many early attempts struggled with problems such as generating too
    many false positives, which resulted mixed attitudes towards it. For example Simon
    Crosby, CTO of Bromium, has argued that while machine learning is very good at
    finding similarities, it is less successful at finding anomalies and therefore
    not suited to Cyber Security. Former Symantec CTO Amit Mital has claimed that
    cybersecurity is “basically broken” and [machine learning is one of the few ‘beacons
    of hope](http://www.csoonline.com/article/3015670/security/machine-learning-cybersecurity-dream-come-true-or-pipe-dream.html).’ I
    disagree with the first opinion, it is factually incorrect. Unsupervised machine
    learning is capable of distinguishing outliers from normal activity.

    or unsupervised learning. Supervised learning requires labelled training datasets
    and is less suited to cyber security. Unsupervised learning doesn't require labelled
    training data and is better suited to finding suspicious activity, including the
    ability to detect attacks that have never been seen before.

- en: Amit Mital's opinion is more interesting. Is cyber security broken? I’m not
    a security expert, so I can’t comment on the technical aspects of security, but
    I can look at the facts. Every day major companies and organizations undergo attacks,
    and some of these attacks are successful. Cyber security is a ‘zero-tolerance
    field,’ by which I mean that one successful attack is a failure of the security.
    It seems to me that if there is even a chance that ML can help then we should
    investigate it.

    For example, Sophos acquired Invincia, Radware bought Seculert and Hewlett Packard
    bought Niara. This may be a sign that at least some major organisations see ML and
    [big data capability](http://blog.blackducksoftware.com/big-data-challenges-open-source-management)
    as [an important asset for the future](http://www.lightreading.com/security/security-platforms-tools/machine-learning-at-heart-of-security-manda-splurge/d/d-id/730174).

    The internet of things will severely challenge existing cyber security methodology.
    Once all those potentially insecure ‘smart’ toilets and toaster ovens and so on
    start coming online, it will significantly increase the amount of data being produced
    and distributed. This may significantly increase the number of weaknesses that
    can be exploited, a challenge that machine learning can perhaps help with.

    a human can deal with. It still requires human intervention. ML is not really
    a ‘plug and play’ technology; it requires tuning to help filter real attacks from
    what appear suspicious but are actually benign activity, and this tuning requires
    human experts. I don't think even the most pro-machine people would claim that
    it can replace firewalls, antivirus or human security experts, but it will complement
    these more traditional defenses to create a more multi-layered defense.

    include a joint effort by MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
    (CSAIL) and a ML startup called PatternEx. The result of this effort is AI2, a
    system that delivers a detection rate of 85%, [with a five fold decrease in false
    positives](http://news.mit.edu/2016/ai-system-predicts-85-percent-cyber-attacks-using-input-human-experts-0418).

    different from ML because it''s based on algorithms that mimic how neurons in
    the brain behave. The goal with deep learning is similar to the goal for unsupervised
    learning: to be able to recognize known and unknown attack types. Deep learning,
    however, may deal with incomplete, messy and complex data better — which is the
    kind of data we see in the real world.'
