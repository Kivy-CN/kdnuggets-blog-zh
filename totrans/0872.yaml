- en: Once upon a time, a small firm had just started its business in the market.
    This firm had a group of professionals who were passionate about their role and
    worked in a way so that the overall firm would profit. As the firm started growing
    in terms of employees or users about the product it was promoting, the management
    team realized that they needed help understanding the need and behavior of users
    or customers towards the product or services the firm was offering.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To overcome this issue, they started hiring some tech professionals. Eventually,
    they were able to find one tech guy under the profile of Data Analyst so that
    they could better understand the customer data. That analyst would be able to
    find important information or insights from it. The analyst they hired had good
    hands-on experience in the same type of technology or projects where they mainly
    worked on exploratory data analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, for this problem, they started collecting data from multiple APIs through
    web scraping in an ethical manner, which includes the company website, social
    media handles, forums, etc. After data collection, they started with cleaning
    and processing the data so that they would be able to find some insights from
    that data. They used statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing and business
    intelligence tools to explore the data and uncover the hidden patterns using pattern
    recognition techniques.

    most interested in buying eco-friendly and sustainable products. The company's
    management launched eco-friendly and sustainable products based on these insights.
    So, based on these updates, the new products were liked by the customers, and
    eventually, the company's revenue started multiplying. Management has started
    realizing the importance of exploratory data analysis and hired more data analysts.

    different techniques inside the exploratory data analysis phase of the pipeline
    and use popular tools in this process, through which you can find million-dollar
    insights for your company. This article provides a comprehensive overview of EDA
    and its importance in data science for beginners and experienced data analysts.

    an average survival rate of 38%. The minimum and maximum value of the age columns

    a minimum of 50% of the passengers don't have siblings/spouses, and a minimum

    the relative frequency instead of the absolute frequency by using Cumulative density

- en: This ends our discussion. Of course, there are many more techniques in EDA than
    I just covered here, which depend on the dataset we will use in our problem statement.
    To sum up, the EDA, knowing your data before you use it to train your model with
    it, is beneficial. This technique plays a crucial role in any Data Science Project,
    allowing our simple models to perform better when used in projects. Therefore,
    every aspiring Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer, and Analytics
    Manager needs to know these techniques properly.
