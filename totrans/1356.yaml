    and process natural human language. If you use Google Search, Alex, Siri, or Google
    Assistant, you’ve already seen it at work. The advantage of NLP is that it allows
    users to make queries without first having to translate them into “computer-speak.”

    to use. [Software developers](https://www.bairesdev.com/software-development-services/?utm_source=kdnuggets&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=content&utm_content=middle)
    are already incorporating it in [more applications](https://towardsdatascience.com/natural-language-processing-nlp-top-10-applications-to-know-b2c80bd428cb)
    than ever, including machine translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis,
    chatbots, market intelligence, text classification, and spell checking.

    data to help business leaders, researchers, and others gain insights that assist
    them in making effective decisions. As we’ll see below, NLP can support data analytics
    efforts in multiple ways, such as solving major global problems and helping more
    people, even those not trained in data processing, use these systems.

    processes like medical research. This technology is especially important now,
    as researchers attempt to find a vaccine for COVID-19.

    (WEF) points out that NLP can help researchers tackle COVID-19 by going through
    vast amounts of data that would be impossible for humans to analyze. “Machines
    can find, evaluate, and summarise the tens of thousands of research papers on
    the new coronavirus, to which thousands are added every week….” In addition, this
    technology can help track the spread of the virus by detecting new outbreaks.

    “[train] machines to analyze a user question in a full sentence, then to read
    the tens of thousands of scholarly articles in the database, rank them and generate
    answer snippets and summaries.” For example, a researcher may use the question,
    “Is COVID-19 seasonal?” and the system reviews the data and returns relevant responses.

    intelligence (AI) can help professionals solve other global challenges, such as
    clean energy, global hunger, improving education, and natural disasters. For example,
    according to a Council Post appearing on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/09/03/15-social-challenges-ai-could-help-solve/#633b5de3533d),
    “Huge companies like Google are setting their sights on flood prevention, utilizing
    AI to predetermine areas of risk and notify people in impacted areas.”

    article, “With natural language search capabilities, users don’t have to understand
    SQL or Boolean search, so the act of searching is easier.” As the quality of insights
    depends on knowing how to “ask the right questions,” this skill may soon become
    essential for business operators, managers, and administrative staff.

    a question like, “What was the inventory turnover rate last fiscal year compared
    to this fiscal year?” The system would convert each phrase to numeric information,
    search for the needed data, and return it in natural language format. Such queries
    allow any employee in any department to gain critical insights to help them make
    informed decisions.

    trained data professionals to correctly input queries and understand results.
    But NLP is changing that dynamic, resulting in what some experts are calling “data
    democratization”: the ability for more people to have access to data sets formerly
    reserved only for those with the advanced skills needed to interpret it.'

- en: The more people within a company who know how to gather insights based on data,
    the more that company can benefit from a data-driven culture, which is one that
    relies on hard evidence rather than guesswork, observation, or theories to make
    decisions. Such a culture can be nurtured in any industry, including healthcare,
    manufacturing, finance, retail, or logistics.

    of customers who spend the most per purchase and target those customers with special
    offers or loyalty rewards. A manufacturing shift leader might want to test different
    methods within its operations to determine which one yields the greatest efficiency.
    With NLP, the commands needed to get this information can be executed by anyone
    in the business.

    BI and analytics vendors are offering NLP capabilities but they're in the minority
    for now. More will likely enter the market soon to stay competitive.”

    in ways not possible before. This new type of collaboration will allow improvements
    in a wide variety of human endeavors, including business, philanthropy, health,
    and communication.

    context and even nonverbal human cues like body language and facial expressions.
    In other words, conversations with computers are likely to continue becoming more
    and more human.
