    are used to judge the sentiment expressed within a body of text and is an essential
    technology behind modern applications of customer feedback assessment, social
    media sentiment tracking, and market research. Sentiment helps businesses and
    other organizations assess public opinion, offer improved customer service, and
    augment their products or services.

    is a language processing model that, when initially released, improved the state
    of the art of NLP by having an important understanding of words in context, surpassing
    prior models by a considerable margin. BERT's bidirectionality — reading both
    the left and right context of a given word — proved especially valuable in use
    cases such as sentiment analysis.

    BERT for your own sentiment analysis projects, using the Hugging Face Transformers
    library. Whether you are a newcomer or an existing NLP practitioner, we are going
    to cover a lot of practical strategies and considerations in the course of this
    step-by-step tutorial to ensure that you are well equipped to fine-tune BERT properly
    for your own purposes.

    our model. Specifically, this will require Hugging Face Transformers, in addition
    to both PyTorch and Hugging Face's datasets library at a minimum. You might do
    so as follows.

    places used to demonstrate sentiment analysis. Let's go ahead and load the dataset
    using the `datasets` library.

    algorithms. BERT has a special tokenization step which ensures that when a sentence
    fragment is transformed, it will stay as coherent for humans as it can. Let’s
    see how we can tokenize our data by using `BertTokenizer` from Transformers.
