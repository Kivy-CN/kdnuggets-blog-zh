    chance to see a lot of amazing research come out. Especially in the field of artificial
    intelligence and more precisely computer vision. More, many important aspects
    were highlighted this year, like the ethical aspects, important biases, and much
    more. Artificial intelligence and our understanding of the human brain and its
    link to AI is constantly evolving, showing promising applications in the soon
    future, which I will definitely cover.

    car using a new artificial intelligence system based on the brains of tiny animals,
    such as threadworms. They achieved that with only a few neurons able to control
    the self-driving car, compared to the millions of neurons needed by the popular
    deep neural networks such as Inceptions, Resnets, or VGG. Their network was able
    to completely control a car using only 75 000 parameters, composed of 19 control
    neurons, rather than millions!

    human in a picture and remove the background from it. It is really hard to achieve
    due to the complexity of the task, having to find the person or people with the
    perfect contour. In this post, I review the best techniques used over the years
    and a novel approach published on November 29th, 2020\. Many techniques are using
    basic computer vision algorithms to achieve this task, such as the GrabCut algorithm,
    which is extremely fast, but not very precise.
