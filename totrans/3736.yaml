    in all the unstructured data they handle daily, and buried in archives whose size
    increased immensely over the years. We’re observing the (re)birth of an industry
    made of many players offering Artificial Intelligence-based solutions, organizations
    asking for their help in understanding the content of their documents, new important
    roles like the one of Data Scientist.

    what Natural Language processing is really about. Most companies look at it like
    it’s *one big technology*, and assume the vendors’ offerings might differ in product
    quality and price but ultimately be largely the same. Truth is, **NLP is not one
    thing**; it’s not one tool, but rather a toolbox. There’s great diversity when
    we consider the market as a whole, even though most vendors only have one tool
    each at their disposal, and that tool isn’t the right one for every problem. While
    it is understandable that a technical partner, when approached by a prospective
    client, will try to address a business case using the tool it has, from the client’s
    standpoint this isn’t ideal. Each problem demands a different solution.

- en: 'I’ll start by saying that, the way I look at this problem, those two questions
    are very much connected. Some approaches (like, for instance, ML-based ones) can
    respond to a short time-to-market requirement, it is in fact possible to deliver
    very quickly a solution that has *good-enough* performance, at least for some
    use cases (for example those where you can ignore a balance between [Precision
    and Recall](https://community.expert.ai/articles-showcase-56/precision-and-recall-f-score-and-accuracy-measuring-nlp-performance-191?)),
    especially when our solution happens to be based on a large archive that happened
    to be, for some reason, manually pre-tagged in the past. On the other hand, a
    project might demand high precision and high recall, but it mostly revolves around
    proper nouns or codes that are unique (that is, rarely presenting any ambiguity),
    so it’s easier to approach the problem using a straight-forward list of keywords.
    Unfortunately, we don’t have strict guidelines on when a methodology is better
    than others, this choice is tightly linked to the specific solution we want to
    build…but there are a few general rules. Since everything in life comes with advantages
    and drawbacks, here’s a (again, simplified) view:'
  prefs: []

    of unambiguous words are involved, not advisable when relevant words can represent
    multiple meanings'

    collect information in great detail, and it’s ideal when one wants to remove noise
    from the results, but it’s not the best solution when a goal needs to be reached
    quickly or if the effort needs to be kept to a minimum (unless we’re talking of
    an already-customized solution, in fact some NLP vendors are specialized in a
    single industry, which makes the development faster)'

    years in the form of techniques we generally address as Deep Learning, mostly
    on the promise to require very little effort and time to deliver a solution starting
    from scratch; and it is true that sometimes it’s incredibly easy to reach 75%
    [Accuracy](https://community.expert.ai/articles-showcase-56/precision-and-recall-f-score-and-accuracy-measuring-nlp-performance-191?)
    with a very basic algorithm (assuming you have a large-enough corpus that’s been
    tagged, or you’re willing to put in the work). This is probably why a lot of startups,
    notoriously careful when it comes to spending, are riding this horse. If your
    application expects a production-grade accuracy (which I personally define as
    north of 85% F-score) then the problem could seem insurmountable, depending on
    the use case, in fact we have lately read more and more articles talking about
    Machine Learning not being the ideal approach to NLP problems, and a few names
    in the industry have reshaped their message into something like “Machine Learning
    is here to work *with* you”.'

    list: *Classification, Entity Extraction, Sentiment, Summarization, Part-of-Speech,
    Triples (SAO), Relations, Fact Mining, Linked Data, Heuristics, Emotions/Feelings/Moods*.
    Almost every single use case in Computational Linguistics can be reconducted to
    ***meta-tagging***; a document goes through an engine, and it comes out richer,
    decorated with a list of tags indicating key intelligence data related to it.
    It’s probably this simple concept that has so many companies think all NLP technologies
    are the same, but the point is: what do you want to tag your documents with? Categories
    coming from a standard taxonomy? Names of companies mentioned in the text? An
    indication of the document’s general sentiment stated as “positive” or “negative”?
    Maybe a combination of the above (e.g., sentiment for each entity extracted from
    the document)?'

    offers, for example, Classification, it’s pretty common for them to build an argument
    on how to address any use case through the process of classifying content. The
    same way I can put a nail into a wall using my shoe, but if I had a hammer I’d
    probably go with that. How can we recognize the tool we need for each project?
    Some are more obvious than others, but let me give you a few pointers about the
    most famous:'

    comes from recognizing that a document belongs to a very specific, predefined
    class (sports, food, insurance policies, financial reports about the energy market
    in south-east Asia, …). Like storing magazines in a box and putting a label on
    it. The name of a class isn’t necessarily mentioned in a document belonging to
    that class'

    vendors in the NLP space, and, more importantly, **NLP is still growing every

    hard to sort through everything that the market offers. Having said that, knowing
    that every product is profoundly different helps in making the right choice.
