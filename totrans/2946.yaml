    Optical Flow [[Lucas, Kanade ‘81](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~stb/klt/lucas_bruce_d_1981_1.pdf)]. 
    Around ''80, they were working the problem of tracking.  His student Bruce Lucas
    came up with an idea: the solution as a combination of the Taylor series expansion
    (well known for 300 years) and the graphical solution for a quadratic equation. 
    Lucas insisted they should write a paper and Dr. Kanade insisted they should not
    publish as it seemed trivial … the student insisted and finally, the Professor
    gave in … allowing the student to publish in an obscure journal.  Lo, behold! 
    Of the 400+ papers Dr. Kanade has published, this has become the most-referenced
    paper of all.  Every algorithm that has video processing uses this concept.'
