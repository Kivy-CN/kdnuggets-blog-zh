    data science, then you will need to know the best route to take. The good news
    is that there is an abundance of free resources to get you there and awesome online
    communities to help you along the way. The bad news is that it can get overwhelming
    to pick which resources to take advantage of. This here is a no-nonsense guide
    that you can follow without regret, so you can spend less time worrying about
    the trail and more time trekking it. It’s based on the lessons I learned when
    I went from a renewable energy project engineer who had never taken a statistics
    class to the head of a major data platform.

    doing data analysis by necessity, not passion. They were trained to be engineers
    and business analysts, who picked up the easiest software possible to run their
    equations. Spreadsheets are beautiful because they are so visual. You can literally
    see and metaphorically feel the numbers through every step of the equations. Building
    a master spreadsheet is an intimate process. (Don’t believe me? Try criticizing
    somebody’s color scheme when they show you their new template.) However, spreadsheets
    quickly reach limitations once you move from prototype to full-scale data analysis.
    Once you encounter a circular reference that takes a full day to fix, start planning
    your restroom breaks around when you need to open large files or spend a week
    trying to recreate an analysis that somebody else completed, it’s time to move
    on. With the first steps of your journey, you want to remove the manual steps
    of your spreadsheets, speed them up, and make the formulas easier to track. You
    want to start programming.

- en: 'You are now faced with the most important decision of your life. Most aspirational
    data scientists never make it past this massive obstacle. What programming language
    are you going to learn first? To save you some anxiety, you should know that there
    truly are no wrong answers; it’s like choosing between a puppy and a new car (or
    a cat and a motorcycle for some of you out there). While there are plenty of programming
    languages to choose from, there are only two which I would recommend at this point
    on the trail: Python and R.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could spend months reading articles about which one is better, but they
    all end up saying the same thing. So, save yourself some burden and let this be
    the last time you dwell on this topic. This guide is no-nonsense, remember? I’ll
    shoot it to you straight.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are going to collaborate with anybody, and they already made this choice,
    then choose the same language. Life is easier that way. Assuming you are blazing
    this trail for your team (which is awesome), I probably recommend you pick R.
    The language was designed specifically to make the lives of non-computer programmers
    easier, and the learning community is incredible. More importantly, the RStudio
    IDE (Integrated Development Environment; a place where you will edit your code)
    makes getting started a lot easier than if you use Python. (It will feel like
    using Matlab, for anybody who used that in college.) That all said, Python is
    the more popular language for software engineers and is used a bit more in the
    “real world” when you start building machine learning applications.
  prefs: []

- en: I personally started teaching myself Python for normal computer programming
    purposes and got caught up on a lot of frustrating stuff (like the darned PATH
    variable), which made progress slow at the start. When I started learning Data
    Science, I switched to R and really enjoyed the experience. More recently, I dug
    into the data science packages for Python and now flip back and forth between
    the two frequently (something that is surprisingly easy).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to give this topic a bit more justice, you should read [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/should-an-engineer-learn-r-or-python-c91b36215a91) that
    dives into more detail. Then, you should pick one and get started.

    If you chose R, use RStudio and read “R For Data Science” (often abbreviated R4DS)
    by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. If you chose Python, download JupyterLab
    (using Anaconda) and read “Python Data Science Handbook” by Jake VanderPlas. Both
    of these books are available free online.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Either book will take you from complete novice to beyond-spreadsheet capabilities,
    enabling you to tackle a wide range of projects. So, do it. Take a data analysis
    process that was really frustrating you (maybe it was having to copy data from
    a bunch of CSVs into one template, maybe it was a process that required a bunch
    of spreadsheets and copying/pasting data between them, etc.) and write an R/Python
    script to do it for you. When you hit roadblocks, reach out to the community for
    support.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest step that propelled me forward was understanding the concept of
    tidy data. For that reason, I recommend reading the “Tidy Data” paper by Hadley
    Wickham and putting its principles to use in your code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, by far, the most fun piece of doing any data analysis is creating awesome
    visualizations. Make sure you spend a lot of time playing with your plots. These
    are how you will impress other people into seeing your code is better than their
    spreadsheets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, since you are now doing deeper data analysis, it may be beneficial to
    review the principles of firm statistics. I recommend “The Art of Statistics”
    by David Spiegelhalter. It’s a non-textbook that walks through the mindset behind
    the math of statistics, which is more applicable for somebody coding than a deep
    dive into the math itself.

    Analyst. At this point in time, you can now do everything you could do in Excel,
    and then some. Analyzing data is now considerably faster, you automate the boring
    stuff, and you have way more fun making plots. For many, this is as far as you
    wanted to go. However, the next couple of steps will look awfully enticing. If
    you thought you were having fun before, wait until you make your first dashboard.

    Or for you Pythonistas, look at the Dash Enterprise App Gallery ([https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/)).
    These are dashboards, a place where you can combine all the results from your
    data analyses into one location so that your business leaders can awe at the work
    you put in and make educated decisions driven by data. (Pretty nice catchphrase,
    right?) Taken a step further, dashboards can be web apps that allow other members
    of your team to run your code through a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Is there
    software that your team currently uses but drives you nuts? You could recreate
    it but tailor-made to do exactly what you want and nothing else, seriously reducing
    the number of clicks you take. And the output of this program could be a beautiful
    PDF report.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Long story short, dashboards are dope. You want to master making these. Start
    by taking one of your analyses and turning its results into a dashboard, and then
    build on from there. Use the Shiny package for R and the Dash package for Python.
    There is plenty of documentation to help you out, including the book “Mastering
    Shiny” by Hadley Wickham, but unlike the basic data science books, I don’t necessarily
    recommend working all the way through them. Just get coding and use them to help
    you when you aren’t sure how to do something. Again, the learning community is
    your friend.

    automated scripts, you will need to start collaborating. At first, you will probably
    share your code with somebody to run on their computer through email or filesharing.
    Similarly, with each new analysis you start, you will likely copy your last analysis
    and start changing pieces here and there to morph it to the new data. This is
    how everybody starts, but it quickly gets messy. Plus, you would like a better
    way to keep track of changes to the code and to let other people edit it jointly.
    To handle all of this, you will want to turn your code into a package, which you
    host on GitHub. Then, everybody has access to the code, and you can even make
    it open source, allowing you to collaborate with the world.
  prefs: []

    and the official Python Packaging documentation ([https://packaging.python.org/overview/](https://packaging.python.org/overview/)).

    ([https://guides.github.com/](https://guides.github.com/)).

- en: The first time you build an app for your team, managing local environments will
    cause you a lot of frustration. By this, I mean that everybody’s computers will
    have different files installed and nuances within their operating systems that
    force code running in their “environment” to behave differently from yours. It’s
    a very messy thing to understand and heavy into computer science instead of basic
    data science. I avoided learning about environment management as long as I could,
    but once I did, it made my life so much easier. Whether proactively or by necessity,
    you will need to learn this yourself. I never found a great resource for learning
    about this, so I made one [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-environments-adfeb5dadd7a)
    that I recommend you read.

    past simple linear regression and calculating averages. You need to start digging
    into advanced statistics and (buzz-word-alert!) Machine Learning. This trek is
    one of the steeper ones. It’s possible to blindly try open-source machine learning
    models, but that’s a little bit like playing with fire. You should really understand
    what you are doing, or else the computer will try to subvert your motives into
    something maniacal. I’m not saying you have to understand all of the math going
    into each model, but you should get comfortable with what the math is trying to
    accomplish. You also want to start gleaning bigger inferences from your data,
    recognizing patterns that you missed with the untrained eye. You should learn
    even more of the nuances of statistics to make sure you are coming to conclusions
    responsibly. This truly is the section about great power requiring great responsibility.
    Learn these tools well, and you can do good.

    on Coursera, taught by Stanford professor and Machine Learning celebrity Andrew
    Ng. You can find the homework assignments in Python and R instead of Octave (the
    programming language he uses in his course) hosted on GitHub. Another fantastic
    course to follow this one is the MIT Intro To Deep Learning (6.S191) class. It’s
    an MIT course made publicly available each year after it concludes. This course
    uses Python and a package called TensorFlow. (Note, Deep Learning is a type of

    could be due to the amount of computing power needed, the need to aggregate data
    from lots of sources into one location, or the need for a continuously running
    application and not a one-time analysis. When this is the case, you will turn
    to cloud computing, which means you must find a way to get the data into that
    cloud as well. At this point, you are likely transitioning from data analyst/scientist
    to data engineer. There is a lot to this, and most of it is cloud-hosting-provider
    specific. To avoid this route, you could use something like RStudio Cloud, which
    will do all of the messy stuff for you. Otherwise, you will need to brush up on
    a lot of computer science concepts, like partitioning, replication, and networking.

    to actually host an application, you should definitely check out Google Colab
    Notebooks. These enable you to run Jupyter notebooks on the cloud instead of on
    your own computer without any fancy set up. It’s ideal for sharing code without
    having to deal with local environment issues as well.
