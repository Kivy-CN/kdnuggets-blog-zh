    a huge explosion of data. While more data is always welcomed, it comes with its
    own sets of challenges, especially when it comes to data management. Data that
    is not managed effectively is as good as no data at all.

    unstructured) annually. So, if a business is producing and managing around 10PB
    of data today, hypothetically it will be managing 14PB of data the next year.
    Now the problem with this exponential growth in data is that it pressurizes businesses
    to scale and adapt quickly.

    the cloud storage market is booming. IDC expects that by 2025, 87% of the world’s
    total storage would reside on the cloud.

    On top of the mind, you could say convenience, since it makes your data available
    anytime, anywhere. But is the rapid shift justified? Well, there is more to the
    cloud than meets the eye.

    billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate of 22%. There are a few major

    storage, block storage, and file storage. Object storage is ideal for unstructured
    data, such as images and videos. What sets object storage apart from others is
    the usage of metadata. Some common examples of object storage, include Amazon
    S3, Google Cloud, and Azure Blob storage.'

    software, and human resources to maintain on-prem data centers. Some companies
    hesitate due to the complex process and cost involved in migration. However, as
    organizations learn to adapt, the cost of the cloud goes down. An easy-to-use
    cloud data integration tool can also help make the process seamless and reduce
    costs.

    storage tiers, so you can manage the cost of storing your data according to its
    usage. For example, Azure Blob storage has three tiers of access: hot, cold, and
    archive. Hot storage has low accessibility costs but high storage costs, making
    it ideal for current data. Archive tier, on the other hand, has low storage costs
    but high accessibility costs, which makes it better suited for historical data.'

    cannot afford.

    a huge issue for organizations. Data centers are ripe for hacking, and we are
    not exaggerating. In 2014, Target came under attack and 40 million debit and credit
    card information was stolen. A similar hack happened with JP Morgan Chase in 2015\.
    It was one of the biggest hacks, where 80 million accounts were compromised. The
    hackers exploited a vulnerability in the encryption software to gain access to
    the financial institution’s information.

    even natural disasters. However, when it comes to choosing between cloud and on-prem,
    the cloud is always a better option because running a data center is not the core
    strength or primary business for organizations. Hence, they are better off using
    the services of companies, such as Amazon, that specialize in this domain.

    longer run, the cloud definitely has more value than on-prem data centers.
