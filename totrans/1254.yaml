- en: Defining the terms data science and business intelligence -- and the relationship
    between them -- has long been the subject of heated debate. Although these terms
    are related, failing to grasp the separate and distinct concepts behind them can
    have significant consequences.

- en: For example, hundreds of thousands of data science (DS) and business intelligence
    (BI) jobs will open up in the next few years. The pool of candidates can seem
    impossibly small or surprisingly large depending on how relevant and useful you
    judge the required skills of each position to be. Can a BI expert successfully
    transition to a DS role? Is DS important to BI positions?

    projects. What gets the green light and what gets shelved will be affected by
    how executives and their teams understand and define the two terms. Project champions
    are quick to attach industry buzzwords to their projects to ride the latest trend,
    but are such projects just a rebranding of older ideas?

- en: Data management and data visualization are still at the core of any effort to
    understand and plan a business. These involve technologies and processes to capture,
    clean, standardize, integrate, visualize, and secure data in a high-performing
    way. Excel is not enough. A pretty dashboard is not enough. You must commit long
    term to preserve data as an asset, and you need discipline to build and maintain
    data lake and data warehouse environments.

- en: The crucial point is that any DS or BI initiative that does not have a solid
    data foundation will be unsustainable. Any processes that are built on manual,
    inconsistent processes will be slow, untrustworthy, and resource intensive. Eventually
    they need to mature with professional IT assistance, or they will fall apart under
    their own weight.

- en: Since the 1980s, nearly every company has tried to use computers and databases
    to manage and understand their historical data. However, here is the thing --
    after almost 40 years, nobody has truly mastered it. Every year, companies add
    or replace software systems, and the IT department can rarely keep up, so enterprises
    end up constantly prioritizing projects to see which data gets attention and which
    data gets ignored (sorry, marketing department).

    diagrams, and data integration projects. It is expensive and frustrating -- but
    indispensable.

- en: BI has a permanent advantage over DS because it has concrete data points; few,
    simple assumptions; self-explanatory metrics; and automated processes. Furthermore,
    BI will never go away. It will always be a work in progress because you will never
    stop changing your business or upgrading and replacing the source systems.

    and will never get you where you want to go. At some point you need to look ahead.
    BI needs to be accompanied by data science.

- en: Where traditional planning is done in discrete, human-directed sessions, DS
    techniques should result in planning and optimization steps that are embedded
    into software and run as part of automated processes. The model is trained using
    historical data, setting aside a subset of data to validate the accuracy of prediction.
    If the results are promising, then the model is deployed and monitored, often
    using BI reports.

- en: Finding business sponsorship for DS projects is a challenge because the techniques
    are difficult to explain and visualize. The projects are difficult to manage and
    often involve unstructured or semistructured data, complex assumptions, statistical
    models, exploratory projects that come to dead ends, and limited or confusing
    visualizations.

- en: Although BI projects are often completed by a single person, DS projects require
    extensive cooperation between employees who don't usually speak the same language,
    including data engineers, statisticians, business experts, and software developers.
    The competencies of each position require many years to master. Data scientists
    often have deep expertise in statistics but only elementary software development
    skills and limited business expertise. DS teams need to partner with IT and business
    departments to create truly integrated solutions.

- en: The bottom line is that the difference between the terms is a matter of whether
    you need to look back (BI) or look forward (data science). BI collects data to
    understand events in the past. DS generates data to model events that have not
    yet occurred.

- en: Knowing the difference between the practices is vital to approving or rejecting
    a proposed project, hiring staff with skills needed for a BI or a DS project,
    and architecting a data management platform that can support both. We should avoid
    looking at them as competing initiatives or as fads that will pass. Both data
    science and business intelligence are here for the long term and will be major
    differentiators for business that harness their potential.
