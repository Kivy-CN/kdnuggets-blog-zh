    a coherent data strategy. We all know that the problem is not with a lack of data,
    we know that we have a lot of that. The problem is how we take the data and transform
    it into actionable insights.

    make a clear decision. Funny how too much data has become a problem, right? This
    is why companies must understand how to approach a new data science problem.

    problem. You want to accurately define the problem that is being solved. This
    can be done by ensuring that the problem is clear, concise and measurable within
    your organization's limitations.

    but you also don’t want to overcomplicate it. Both make it difficult for data

- en: As you can imagine, for a data science project you need data. With your problem
    clearly defined and you have chosen a suitable approach based on it, you need
    to go and collect the data to back it up.

    sources and all the data that you collect needs to be organized in a log with
    further information such as collection dates, source name, and other useful metadata.

    it is ready for analysis. As a data scientist, you will spend some time cleaning
    the data and getting it in analysis-ready format.

    clean, and we’re now ready to move on to analyzing the data.

- en: Your first phase when analyzing your data is exploratory data analysis. In this
    phase, you want to understand the nature of the data and be able to pick up and
    identify the different patterns, correlations and possible outliers. In this phase,
    you want to know your data inside and out so you don’t come across any shocking
    surprises later on.

- en: Once you have done this, a simple approach to your second phase of analyzing
    the data is to start with trying all the basic machine learning approaches as
    you will have to deal with fewer parameters. You can also use a variety of open-source
    data science libraries to analyze your data, such as scikit learn.
