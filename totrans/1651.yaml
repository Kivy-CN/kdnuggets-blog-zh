    step that we must take into consideration is understanding what **problem**we’re
    trying to solve. **Let’s say this again**. Before we even begin doing anything

    trying to solve. If you have a small problem you want to solve, then at most you’ll
    get a small solution. If you have a *BIG *problem to solve, then you’ll have the

    you introduced a new feature for customers to buy “footwear feature”. You’re old
    model doesn’t have this and now you must update the model that includes this feature.
    If not, your model will degrade over time and won’t perform as good, leaving your
    business to degrade as well. The introduction to new features will alter the model
    performance either through different variations or possibly correlations to other
    features.
