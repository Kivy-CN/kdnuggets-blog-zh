    Using CRISP-DM and How To Fix Them**](/2017/01/four-problems-crisp-dm-fix.html).
    Two of these problems relate to a lack of clarity about the business problem that
    undermines the business value of any analytic developed. Analytic teams need to
    model business decision-making to connect their analytics to the business goals
    as this will bring clarity to the business problem and enable analytic results
    to be evaluated in business terms. In CRISP-DM solving these problems involves
    changes to the Business Understanding and Evaluation phases as shown in Figure
    1.

- en: The first phase of CRISP-DM, Business Understanding, is all about bringing clarity
    to the business problem and so providing a business focus for the project. The
    need for this clarity is persistently under-called by analytic teams and overlooked
    in a rush to find data, analyze it and try new techniques. At best, analytic teams
    identify the business metrics they want to improve and then dive straight in.
  prefs: []

- en: But analytics cannot improve metrics directly. Take customer churn, for instance.
    If you need to reduce customer churn you might develop various analytics – churn
    predictions, propensity to accept retention offer predictions, life time value
    predictions etc. But none of these analytics will, by themselves, improve your
    customer churn rate. Unless you change your behavior – unless you do something
    different – your churn rate is not going to improve. The analytics might give
    you clues as to what change you need to make and how you might need to change
    but unless you actually change behavior you will not get a different outcome.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is it you need to change? Decision-making is the key – only if people
    and systems make different choices, different decisions, will results change.
    If that decision-making can be improved with analytics, then results will improve.
    For instance, simply having a churn model will not reduce churn but deciding to
    focus valuable retention offers on those customers most likely to churn will.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To ensure their analytic results will improve business results, analytic teams
    need to connect the metrics they are focused on to specific decision-making that
    can be improved with analytics. And they need to do this explicitly in the Business
    Understanding step of CRISP-DM. They need to be able to capture which decisions
    must change, how these decisions are made, and by whom. This is where a decision
    model comes in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decision modeling begins by understanding the business measures of success and
    finding the business decisions that impact those measures – especially the day
    to day, repeatable, decisions that do so. One or more of these decisions will
    have to be made differently – more analytically – if the project is going to make
    any business difference. A decision model clarifies this decision-making in terms
    of the question that must be answered to make the decision as well as the possible
    answers. It then breaks down the decision-making and represents it using a simple
    but powerful notation like Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard to clarity
    the decision-making approach.

    to be improved (the rectangle at the top) so the project’s business focus is clear.
    It breaks this decision-making down into its component sub-decisions (more rectangles),
    both to make it clear how the decision is made and to identify the role of the
    specific decision that should be made analytically. It shows the regulations,
    policies and relevant experience involved in making the decision (as Knowledge
    Sources, the document shapes), proposed analytic models and currently used data
    (as Input Data, the flattened ovals). Such a model meets all the requirements
    defined in CRISP-DM for Business Understanding.

    to the model while the systems, processes and business environment that will be
    impacted by any changes can be identified. Because these models are simple and
    visual they can be collaboratively developed and shared between analytic, business
    and IT teams.

- en: With a decision model in hand, analytic teams also have something to evaluate
    their models against. The analytic measures – how accurate is this model, what’s
    its lift – can be used to see how well it would help make the specific analytic
    decision. Changes in the analytical decision can be put into the broader business
    context to see how that will impact overall decision-making. This will show whether
    the analytic approach is a match for the original business intent. Knowing who
    is making the various decisions involved and in what context can also help make
    sure the style of analytic selected will work. For instance, not using a black
    box analytic for a decision that involves regulators or a visual analytic for
    a largely automated decision.

- en: If models don’t evaluate successfully against the decision model, then the project
    is back to square one. It might only need to look at more data or analyze the
    data in a different way, but more likely the team will need to sit down with the
    business and discuss how else the decision could be made. Many projects lose their
    way at this point, continuing to add new data or new refinements to an analytic
    without checking that they are still working toward a valid business objective.
    The data may not support the kind of analytic that would improve the decision
    as currently made but perhaps it will have revealed a way to improve a different
    decision or that the metric is not the right one. A return to Business Understanding
    and an updated decision model may be required to re-focus and give the project
    the purpose it needs to move forward.

    have the business understanding they need to build a successful analytic and gives
    them a business benchmark to assess their analytic results against. With a decision
    model in hand, analytic projects can avoid the first two problems in CRISP-DM
    and build an analytic that will solve a real business problem and make a real
    business difference.
