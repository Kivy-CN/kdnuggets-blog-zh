    Executive Officer. Florian started his career at Exalead, an innovative search
    engine technology company. There, he led a R&D team of 50 brilliant data geeks,
    until the company was bought by Dassault Systemes in 2010 for $150 million. Florian
    was then CTO at IsCool, a European leader in social gaming, where he managed game
    analytics and one of the biggest European cloud setup. Florian also served as
    freelance Lead Data Scientist in various companies, such as Criteo, the European
    Advertising leader.'

- en: '**Florian Douetteau**: In 2012, my partners and I saw an opportunity: the data
    science market was (and still is) extremely fragmented. We’re living in a very
    interesting technological universe where lots of tools and options for working
    on and with data are available. Today, the challenge is more about applying the
    right tool and the right location and then tackling the complexity of having multiple
    storage systems and languages. For instance, you could prefer using Pig for some
    data munging, Hive for computations, Python or R for advanced modeling, ElasticSearch
    for search, Hadoop for large scale processing, and so on.'

    solve and why? What existed and who else was trying to solve it. Then, we focused
    on the users. How could we solve the fragmentation problem of the data science
    ecosystem (for both proprietary and open source solutions) for them better than
    the rest? What weren’t those users getting from available solutions and how could
    we bring it to them intelligently? For us, that meant enabling our users, no matter
    their skill set or level of expertise, to collaborate while maintaining the freedom
    to use the tools and languages they know best.'

- en: '**Florian Douetteau**: Dataiku is guided by the belief that to succeed in the
    world’s rapidly evolving data ecosystem, companies - no matter their industry
    or size - must continuously re-invent & deliver innovative data products. With
    this in mind, our mission is to provide all organizations with the technological
    environment that will enable their teams to effectively dispense the data innovations
    of tomorrow. Dataiku’s approach to collaborative data science and machine learning
    enables these organizations to compete with the digital giants that have blossomed
    in the past decade.'

    and beginner analysts, to a unified framework for both development and deployment
    of data projects, and to immediate access to all the features and tools required
    to design data products from scratch, users can easily apply machine learning
    and data science techniques to all types, sizes, and formats of raw data to build
    and deploy predictive data flows.

    levels can quickly learn and excel in languages like R or Python and discover
    what machine learning is really all about.

    case studies where DSS use led to much better results than say alternative data
    science editors?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Florian Douettea**: Thanks to Dataiku DSS’s collaborative features and advanced
    analytics capabilities, customers such as AXA, L’Oreal, Bechtel, Webbmason, Urban
    Insights, and many more easily apply machine learning and data science techniques
    to all types, sizes, and formats of raw data to build and deploy predictive data
    flows. Use cases range from churn prediction, fraud detection, dynamic customer
    segmentation, cost and logistic optimization, predictive maintenance, trend forecasting,
    and much more. And so far, feedback is excellent: increased team productivity
    (“Within a few months, we’d established 30% increase in productivity”), new business
    opportunities (“With DSS, we have internalized the design & deployment of our
    data solutions”), development of solutions that actually deliver additional revenue
    and savings (“DSS has paid for itself”), quick onboarding (“I’ve even had our
    marketing and business teams try it out”), easy and secure deployment (“We no
    longer have to re-code everything”), etc. And we plan on keeping it that way!'

    (from SQL, R or Python to Hive, Pig, or all things Spark) is great for two main
    reasons:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Different languages are more adapted to different parts of the data science
    workflow – for example, R may be better for statistical computations, whereas
    Python for algorithms, and Hive for all things Hadoop.

    technologies that are available. If team managers enable them to use the tools
    they know best, they’re ensuring optimized productivity and individual freedom.

    is "Live Data": it’s soon going to be all about building products that handle
    data coming from moving, living systems. This means real-time processing. It means
    deep learning techniques. It means having the tools and technologies that can
    handle the complexity of live data structures.'

- en: There is an increasing demand for applications that need to follow a rather
    simple business process, but involve a vast amount of data that is reduced and
    analysed by an algorithm with a human making the final interactions. That’s the
    case of modern fraud detection applications, where an algorithm reduces all weak
    signals from the data, and where the human analyzes the resulting alerts. That’s
    also the case for modern marketing campaign management applications, where an
    algorithm analyses past campaigns, makes attributions, forecasts the current campaign performance,
    and a human takes possible new resource allocation decisions. And there’s a demand
    for similar  “thinking apps” in process quality control, predictive maintenance,
    operational support, human resources, and so on.

    just passive displayers of information or controllers of a process. People expect
    apps that can “think” with them; and at Dataiku we can help people actually implement
    them. That’s exciting!
