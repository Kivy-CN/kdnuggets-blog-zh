    we are treated to a super harsh guide to machine learning, find that Google is
    acquiring Kaggle, get pro-supervised learning advice from Salesforce's chief data
    scientist, hear a goodbye from Andrew Ng as he resigns from Baidu, and learn more
    exciting info about Distill, the web-based "Interactive, Visual Journal for Machine
    Learning Research."

    so some Kaggle competitions. If you have debugging questions, use StackOverflow.
    If you have math questions, read more. If you have life questions, I have no idea.

    this month, Google and Kaggle teamed up to host a $100,000 machine learning competition
    around classifying YouTube videos. That competition had some deep integrations
    with the Google Cloud Platform, too.

    of possibilities for crossover here. The event is either exciting or terrifying,
    depending on your views on potential monopolies. But it's a great branding move,
    and can help Google extend their recent interests in becoming the lone global
    machine learning behemoth.

    meat lovers pizza, just go chop some wood"), I can see where he is coming from
    to some extent. It would be a great educational undertaking, and could support
    the community at large, especially so if he were to encourage the sharing of said
    curated dataset afterward. But really, in general, I wouldn't think that everyone
    working on unsupervised learning problems would or should go out and label classification
    data. That clearly wouldn't lead to progress in unsupervised learning.

    to transforming large companies to use AI, there are also rich opportunities for
    entrepreneurship as well as further AI research. I want all of us to have self-driving
    cars; conversational computers that we can talk to naturally; and healthcare robots
    that understand what ails us. The industrial revolution freed humanity from much
    repetitive physical drudgery; I now want AI to free humanity from repetitive mental
    drudgery, such as driving in traffic.

    visualizations into a single environment. In such an environment, users can explore
    in ways impossible with traditional static media. They can change models, try
    out different hypotheses, and immediately see what happens. That will let them
    rapidly build their understanding in ways impossible in traditional static media.
