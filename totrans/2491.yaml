    I thought it was the great leap of AGI.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today’s neural network lacks in many ways to human brains. Machine learning
    (including deep learning) can solve a particular recognition problem. Yet, intelligence
    is more of a generative problem.

    only an approach of AI, not AI itself.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way humans and animals learn is by creating a representation of the real
    world. Further learning occurs by improving this representation by merging other
    such virtual worlds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is generating ideas from this internal representation and matching them with the
    real world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is [how children learn](https://www.simplypsychology.org/constructivism.html).
    Because of this, they don’t need to necessarily see cats and dogs before they
    start to recognize them. Their parents and surroundings play a role in nurturing
    them to refine the internal representation of the world. Thus they generate ideas
    about dogs and cats, then match them with the natural world to classify when they
    see one.

    They solve the problem by optimizing rather than generating ideas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is why deep neural networks are limited in many ways. For example, they
    require vast quantities of data and labeled training samples. They don’t scale
    very well with complex tasks or problems with large classes/categories.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    learning allows us to use a deep learning model trained on one task as a starting
    point for a similar job.

    transfer learning, you need to comply with many requirements, such as maintaining
    a similar input structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Further, transfer learning is not a solution for the non-generative nature of
    machine learning models. It simply helps the neural network to converge much quickly
    for an adjustment problem.
  prefs: []

    still a recognition problem.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not capable of artificial general intelligence yet. They understand that a trained
    model is a weak form of representing real-world knowledge.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There hasn’t been much-published information on how Pathway works. But according
    to Jeff Dean’s [blog post](https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/),
    Google Pathway is about to solve three of the common challenges towards AGI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pathway enables us to use a single model to solve thousands of different problems.
    This is different from conventional machine learning models as they are trained
    to solve a specific problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, Pathway uses multiple senses. Conventional models use inputs from a single
    sense. For example, computer vision problems take images, and speech recognition
    takes audio signals. The Pathway is expected to have them both and many others
    at once.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Further, Pathway promises to move model execution from dense mode to sparse.
    It means, to solve a problem, you don’t have to activate the entire neural network
    but a specific path in isolation.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not to say that machine learning doesn’t have its place in the field
    of AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It simply means we shouldn’t mistake ML for AGI or assume it’s leading us towards
    achieving something akin to human intelligence and general problem-solving capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deep neural networks (and ML models in general) are suitable for recognition
    problems. But they don’t create a representation of the world which is essential
    to solving more general issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It isn’t clear how Google will solve these challenges towards AGI with Pathway
    yet. We’ll have to wait for some information on that front before we can comment
    further.
