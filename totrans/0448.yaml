    more from the time we waste at the workplace; on commuting, socializing, lunch
    breaks, and meetings. At the end of June, I started looking for part-time work
    and I found a lot of online platforms that had provided me extra income and opportunities
    to work on the things **I love**.

    or a technical manager on ghostwriting jobs. Ghostwriting is a job where writers
    get paid without credit. These jobs are highly lucrative as they pay double the
    current rate. You can even ask for 0.4$ per word if you are an experienced writer.
    Keep an eye on your local or on an online job board for the gigs. Try to negotiate
    the price before signing any contract.

    and clear goals that you have to achieve in a given period. The contract work
    comes in many forms; research work, designing machine learning models, data analysis,
    writing papers, or integrating new tools in a workflow. You can get contract work
    either by searching job boards or being approached by hiring managers.

    subject matter expertise. Most of the time a local recruiter will approach you
    by looking at your LinkedIn profile and propose the project objectives with payment
    details. It can be an hourly rate or a fixed price. I mostly get hourly rate contracts,
    as companies want an expert opinion at the start of the project.

    on investing in tech startups, starting a new venture or project, product analysis,
    and application development.

    educational institute but in reality, students are still struggling. These students
    or recent graduates then look for a professional career counseling platform to
    gain insights on their resumes. These platforms also provide help with technical
    interviews, career coaching, and networking.
