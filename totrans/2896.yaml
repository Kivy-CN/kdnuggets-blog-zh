    papers. So, what you should do in case you want to learn from the academic literature
    whether you want to learn to build a machine learning system/project of interest,
    or just to stay on top of things, gain more knowledge and evolve as a deep learning
    person.

  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Skip around the list**: basically, you should read research papers in a parallel
    fashion; meaning try to tackle more than one paper at a time. Concretely, try
    to quickly skim and understand each of these paper and do not read it all, maybe
    you read 10–20% of each one and probably that will be enough to give you a high-level
    understanding of the paper in hand. After that, you may decide to eliminate some
    of these papers or just go over one or two them and read them fully.'

    the key network architecture figure, and maybe the experiments section, you will

    there are a lot of research papers where the entire paper is summarized in one
    or two figures without the need to go hardly through the text.'

    work done by others that somehow ties in with the author(s) work. Hence, it may
    be useful to read it but if you’re not familiar with the literature, it is sometimes
    very hard to understand.

    you’ll find maybe some parts that is much less used or it doesn’t make sense.
    Consequently, it’s fine if you read a paper and some of it doesn’t make sense
    (it’s not unusual), it’s okay to skim it initially. Unless, you’re trying to master
    it, then spend more time.
