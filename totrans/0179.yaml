- en: The AI Index is an independent report by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered
    Artificial Intelligence (HAI), consisting of experts from different academics
    and a range of industries. The purpose of the annual report is to track, collate,
    and visualize data that is related to artificial intelligence. It is used to steer
    companies and decision-makers in a better direction to advance AI responsibly
    and ethically.
