    I don't like how it's used to disarm analysts. This one simple phrase can bring
    any analysis to a screeching halt as soon as the words are uttered.

- en: This popular phrase has led decision makers to believe that they *need* a causal
    insight in order to make a decision with data. Yes, in a perfect world, we'd only
    act on causal insights. But in practice, this requirement isn't reasonable. More
    often than not, when stakeholders require "causality" to make a decision, it takes
    way too long so they lose patience and end up making a decision without any data
    at all.
  prefs: []

    the requirement of causality today. But an A/B is surprisingly difficult to execute
    correctly - as shown by the countless statisticians waving their hands trying
    to get us to acknowledge this fact (like [this](https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html) and [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-5-mistakes-with-statistics-in-a-b-testing-9b121ea1827c)).
    The sad reality is that A/B tests require a lot of data, flawless engineering
    implementation, and a high level of statistical rigor to do it right... so we
    end up releasing new features without valid results.
  prefs: []

- en: This happens all the time! But data teams are not doing themselves any favors
    by going through the motions of a half-baked attempt at proving causality, just
    to make a gut-based decision at the end of the day. We need to change the approach.

    a higher level of statistical rigor, it also requires A LOT of carefully collected
    data. Meaning you will have to wait a long time before you can make any causal
    claim. This is true for other causal inference methods too, not just A/B testing.

    data. So let's stop trying and find another way. Let's go back to using correlations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm not suggesting a free-for-all. We don't want to end up with ridiculous insights
    that are "technically correlated" but have no reasonable explanation, like [these](https://flowingdata.com/2014/05/12/random-things-that-correlate/).
    I'm talking about using correlations in a business context to maximize our chances
    of making the "best" decision. And doing it in such a way where we can trust that
    the insights give us a reasonable expectation about how any given decision will
    impact the things we care about. After all, this is the goal of data.

    that the correlated relationship we're seeing in the data is actually a causal
    relationship. We can do that by following four best practices below.

    really "surprising" correlation[,](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/hilarious-graphs-and-pirates-prove-that-correlation-is-not) [like
    this](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/hilarious-graphs-and-pirates-prove-that-correlation-is-not).
    Most likely that relationship is due to chance and now you've wasted your time
    and everyone else's. Statisticians refer to this approach as "[p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging)".

- en: Instead, focus on correlating things that are already connected. A great way
    to do this is by focusing on the customer's action. If you try to correlate data
    centered around a customer's actions, you're guaranteed to only explore behaviors
    that are *actually* linked in some way. It sounds simple, but it's easy to overlook.
    For example, we shouldn't look at how "the time of day that we launched a class"
    influences a customer's likelihood to sign up, we should look at how the "time
    of day that *the customer saw the class*" influences their likelihood to sign
    up. Because we're looking at all behavior from the perspective of the customer
    and their actions, we can guarantee the actions are linked, increasing the chances
    that the correlated relationship we see is also causal.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most analyses we're trying to gauge how a particular decision or change will
    influence a customer's behavior. And customer behaviors are best represented with
    conversion rates, not totals. If I tell you that 10 people converted vs 30 people
    converted that doesn't tell me much about the customer's behavioral mindset. If
    I tell you that 10% of people on the website converted vs 30% of people, then
    you have some understanding of the customer's willingness to convert.

- en: Now, imagine trying to correlate the total phone inquiries with total conversions.
    We might see that an increase in the total phone inquiries is highly correlated
    with an increase in total conversions. Obviously yes, because we have a higher
    volume of people in our funnel, but we intuitively know that more phone inquiries
    don't *cause* more conversions. They're just correlated because they're both influenced
    by another factor (volume). By looking at conversion rates, we can more easily
    tease out insights that can be used to influence customer behavior.

- en: You may also want to correlate other normalized metrics (like average order
    value), but if possible this should be avoided. These metrics can have more variance,
    meaning you will either need a lot more data to find a reliable insight OR you
    will need to do dimensionality reduction on the metric (effectively turning it
    into a conversion rate) to reduce the variance before analyzing it. I won't go
    into too much detail on this now, but we'll cover it in a future blog post. In
    the meantime, conversion rates are always a safe bet.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your business and customers are always changing, so it's important to be aware
    of that. Often times we'll look at correlations in an aggregated way, stripping
    time from our analysis. But everything is changing in time so a correlation that
    existed in the past may have disappeared today, and you'll never know it if you
    don't analyze the data over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since historical behavior is the best predictor of future behavior, we need
    to look at how the data has been changing over time, especially as the feature
    we're analyzing has been changing too. If people who have X have consistently
    had a higher metric Y, then we know we can more easily trust that when we get
    more people to do X, we'll have a better shot of also increasing Y. As long as
    the impact is consistent over time, we'll can be more confident that these trends
    will be reliable in the future too.

- en: A good exercise to demonstrate this point is to look back at previous A/B tests
    you've run. When we've done this, we've found that some of them were statistically
    significant during a short blip in time, and not consistent as time went on. This
    is a [common risk](https://cxl.com/blog/12-ab-split-testing-mistakes-i-see-businesses-make-all-the-time/#weeks) in
    A/B testing and as a result, many experts recommend running evergreen tests. This
    comes with lots of engineering complexity though and most teams don't end up setting
    it up.

    likely when we follow best practices above, it's still a risk. But we if can act
    quickly on correlated findings and vigilantly monitor the results, we can significantly
    minimize the risk of any wrong decision becoming a catastrophe. This is true for
    causal insights too, by the way. There is always a risk of things not panning
    out the way you expected ([like in this cautionary tale](https://www.narrator.ai/blog/when-good-data-analyses-fail-to-deliver-the-results-you-expect/)).

    is influencing the outcome you're trying to achieve.  Suppose you found a positive
    correlation between customers who used a discount code and average order value.
    Once you find a correlated trend, you'll want to slowly shift volume of customers
    into the group with the better performance. Then, we can monitor the results using
    the plot below.

- en: In practice, we need accurate insights and we to act fast. Waiting two months
    for an analysis that claims causality or 4 weeks for an A/B test to run its course
    is not going to cut it. But if we can act quickly on correlations, especially
    when they've been rigorously evaluated using the techniques above, we'll be able
    to make better decisions, faster. So, let's retire the phrase "correlation does
    not equal causation" and put a little more faith into correlations themselves.
