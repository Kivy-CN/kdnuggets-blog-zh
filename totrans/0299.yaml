    and was often left feeling lost and confused.

    I struggled with, and after each interview round, I’d feel my confidence falter.

    however, I’ve learned more about what employers are looking for in data analyst
    candidates.
  prefs: []

    expertise, business problem-solving, and soft skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every interview round will cover some aspect of these broader areas, although
    each employer places a higher emphasis on different sets of skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, management consulting firms are big on presentation skills. They
    want to know if you can present complex technical insights to business stakeholders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, your soft skills and ability to problem-solve are prioritized
    more than the technical skill. They don’t care as much about your clean Python
    code as they do your ability to explain the results of a hypothesis test to the
    stakeholder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    skills. They often test your ability to code, perform ETL tasks, and handle deliverables
    in a timely manner.

    a list of technical questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of which will be used to determine if you progress to the next level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of how they can be answered:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. What is hypothesis testing?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Sample answer:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hypothesis testing is a technique used to identify and make decisions about
    population parameters based on a sample dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It starts by formulating a null hypothesis (H0), which represents the default
    assumption that there is no effect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A significance level is then chosen, which is typically 0.05 or 0.10\. This
    is the probability threshold for which the null hypothesis will be rejected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statistical tests, such as the T-test, ANOVA, or the Chi-Squared Test will then
    be applied to test the initial hypothesis using data from the sample population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A test statistic is then computed, along with a p-value, which is the probability
    of observing the test result under the null hypothesis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the p-value falls below the significance level, then the null hypothesis
    can be rejected, and there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. What is the difference between a T-Test and a Chi-Squared Test and when
    would you use them?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Sample answer:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    distribution of different groups of data. They are used in different scenarios.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Sample answer:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are various ways to handle missing data in a dataset depending on the
    problem statement and the variable’s distribution. Some common approaches include:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you can simply drop these entire rows from the dataset.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Imputation: Depending on the underlying variable distribution, you can choose
    to impute missing values with the mean, median, or mode. For instance, if the
    feature is normally distributed, the mean can be used to preserve the overall
    distribution of the data.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Sample answer:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To detect outliers, I would visualize the variables using a box plot to identify
    the points outside the chart’s whiskers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would also calculate the Z-score for each variable and identify data points
    with a Z-score of +3 or -3 as they are typically outliers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reduce the impact of outliers, I would transform the dataset using a function
    like RobustScaler() in Scikit-Learn, which scales the data according to the quantile
    range.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I might also use a transformation like the log, square root, or BoxCox transformation
    to normalize the variable’s distribution.

- en: 5\. Explain the difference between the “Where” and “Having” clauses in SQL.
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Sample answer:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The “Where” clause is used to filter rows in a table based on individual conditions
    and is applied before any groupings are made.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In comparison, the “Having” clause is used to filter records after a table has
    been aggregated, and can only be used in conjunction with the “Group By” clause.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6\. If Table 1 has 100 records and Table 2 has 200 records, what is the range
    of records you’d expect from an inner join between these tables?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Sample answer:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An inner join returns only records that have matching values between tables.
    If there are no matching values in the dataset, the result of the inner join might
    be 0\.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If all the rows between Table 1 and Table 2 match, then the query will return
    the total number of records in Table 1, which is 100.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, the range of expected records from an inner join between these tables
    is anywhere between 0 to 100.

  prefs: []

    a better understanding of the target audience and realized that the female-directed
    movies in my dataset had lower ratings due to them being concentrated in a genre
    that was more poorly rated.
