    Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)** presents critical fulminations
    to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late December
    2019 in China.

    widely in severity. The first known severe illness caused by a coronavirus appeared
    with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (**SARS**) epidemic in China.
    A second outbreak of severe illness originated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the
    Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (**MERS**). And now the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
