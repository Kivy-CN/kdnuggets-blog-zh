- en: Uber continues its innovative contributions to open source machine learning
    technologies. Last week, the transportation giant [open sourced Ludwig 0.3](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/?from=%40),
    the third update to its no-code machine learning platform. Over the last few months,
    the Ludwig community has expanded beyond Uber and includes contributors such as
    Stanford University. This new release expands on the AutoML capabilities of its
    predecessors. Let’s do a recap of previous versions of Ludwig and explore this
    new release.

    training and evaluating machine learning models for a given scenario. Ludwig provides
    a set of model architectures that can be combined together to create an end-to-end
    model optimized for a specific set of requirements. Conceptually, Ludwig was designed
    based on a series of principles:'

- en: Using Ludwig, a data scientist can train a deep learning model by simply providing
    a CSV file that contains the training data as well as a YAML file with the inputs
    and outputs of the model. Using those two data points, Ludwig performs a multi-task
    learning routine to predict all outputs simultaneously and evaluate the results.
    Under the covers, Ludwig provides a series of deep learning models that are constantly
    evaluated and can be combined in a final architecture. The main innovation behind
    Ludwig is based on the idea of data-type specific encoders and decoders. Ludwig
    uses specific encoders and decoders for any given data type supported. Like in
    other deep learning architectures, encoders are responsible for mapping raw data
    to tensors while decoders map tensors to outputs. The architecture of Ludwig also
    includes the concept of a combiner which is a component that combine the tensors
    from all input encoders, process them, and return the tensors to be used for the
    output decoders.

    Hyperopt can be called using a simple syntax:'

    for rapid experimentation and hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models.
    To use W&B, Ludwig users can simple append the -wandb parameters to their commands.

    addresses this challenge by introducing integration with many other formats such
    as excel, feather, fwf, hdf5, html tables, json, jsonl, parquet, pickle, sas,
    spss, stata and tsv. The new datasets can be used using a simple command line:'

    and k-fold cross-validation for training which complement an already impressive
    release. Little by little, Ludwig is becoming one of the most impressive open
    source AutoML stacks in the market.
