    were [responsible](http://layoffs.fyi) for over 50,000 layoffs ([10,000](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/)

    and current setting. I’ll also describe ways to increase your odds both for FAANG
    companies and others. Ultimately, it’s not as hard as you think. I’d also encourage
    you to broaden your perspective on getting accepted to a tech company.

    for the acronym: Facebook (now Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (really
    Alphabet). The acronym was coined by CNBC’s Jim Cramer in 2013\. Those companies
    were outperforming the broader market at the time, and FAANG caught on.'
  prefs: []

- en: But it’s also useful to think of FAANG as a stand in for tech companies at large
    – think Microsoft, AirBnb, and Spotify. When I say FAANG has a low acceptance
    rate, what I really mean is that these big, loud tech companies are hard to get
    into, including Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, and Google, but also a lot of
    other flashy tech companies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overall, FAANG companies in both senses are known for rapid growth at all costs,
    dominant market positions, and innovative products. They attracted a lot of tech
    talent throughout the 2010s – applicants really thought they could help build
    products to make the world a better place.

    (6,800 in 2019) by the total number of applicants (350k). That means that even

    less than 2%. In reality, it was probably a lot smaller.

    had a very cool vibe – think ping-pong tables, free lunch, and other awesome perks

    fit is super important. Netflix [didn’t want](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-culture-deck-top-most-impactful-slides-2019-10)

    or worse, has hit a rocky patch. FAANG companies are no longer universally recognized
    as the best to work at. As VC money dries up and they struggle to pivot profitably,
    salaries and perks can be just as good at smaller companies. Plus, it’s clear
    FAANG doesn’t offer any job reliability as they laid off 5-10% of their workforce
    in certain instances.

    ZipRecruiter [found](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/blog/laid-off-tech-workers/)

    junk. Like I said, everyone applies to FAANG because it’d be awesome to work there.
    But hiring managers are able to discard a huge number of those applications because
    they’re just not very good. Do a little bit of legwork. Networking can increase
    your chances tremendously. Attend a conference to meet people. Tailor your resume
    and cover letter for each application. That alone will help you stand head and
    shoulders above most FAANG applicants.
