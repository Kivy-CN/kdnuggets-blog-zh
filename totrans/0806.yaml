    that is easy to comprehend. Visualizations can include charts, maps, graphs, infographics,
    and other elements that help to simplify data. This makes it easy to identify
    patterns and trends, spot inconsistencies and outliers, and help an audience conclude
    the data that is being presented.

    possibility of making inaccurate assumptions when there are a large number of

- en: The first step when creating a data visualization is to fully determine who
    the audience is, their knowledge level, and their technical expertise. If you
    know the individuals well then you may also have an understanding of their general
    attention span and their interest in the subject.

- en: When designing a data visualization, simplicity is critical, removing any unnecessary
    elements that could distract or confuse the audience. The overall message should
    be abundantly clear, without any clutter. To achieve this, implement an eye-catching
    and consistent color scheme, clear and suitably-sized fonts, and utilize white
    space, grids, and margins to organize the page layout. Large titles, legends,
    and labels can also help to explain the content more clearly.

    a clear story that keeps the audience engaged and gradually reaches a conclusion.
    Make sure you include any relevant background information before delving into
    the figures and highlight the key points to ensure they’re understood.

    presenting it to an audience. Make sure the key points are apparent, the data
    is accurate, and that charts and graphs are easy to follow. Having the visualization
    cross-checked by a colleague is one of the best ways to find any errors, typos,
    or inconsistencies, plus they can also give honest feedback on whether the design
    and content are engaging.
