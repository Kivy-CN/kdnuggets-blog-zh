- en: When a lot of people think about getting into data science and what programming
    language they should learn - a lot of people naturally turn to Python. And there’s
    a reason for this. It is considered one of the best programming languages to learn
    and has been number one for a while now. It contains a variety of libraries and
    frameworks and uses readable code.

- en: A lot of bootcamps sometimes don’t go over certain elements that are very important
    to the world of data science - statistics is one of them. From personal experience,
    I entered the data science world with little to no understanding of the statistics
    side as my course never offered it. I caught myself having to go back to relearn
    a lot of things - the right way!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in that journey was Josh Starmer from StatQuest who made statistics fun
    and easy to learn. Statistics is important to data science and important to the
    progression of your career. It allows you to have a better understanding of what
    data science is and why it matters in your entire data science workflow when creating
    solutions.

    when working with data, you need to remember that a lot of the data given will
    be messy and you will need to spend time cleaning the data. This is one of the
    first steps in the data science workflow and is an important one.

    techniques on how to get clean and consistent data. The live training will give
    you insight into the type of data-cleaning challenges you will come across.

    produce outputs for the decision-making process. As part of your role as a data
    scientist, you will be responsible for turning your outputs into data visualizations.
    This is to present your data in other forms, as well as cater to stakeholders
    who are not highly technically inclined.
