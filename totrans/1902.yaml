    100 positive cases among 10,000 cases. You want to predict which ones are positive,
    and you pick 200 to have a better chance of catching many of the 100 positive
    cases.  You record the IDs of your predictions, and when you get the actual results
    you sum up how many times you were right or wrong. There are four ways of being
    right or wrong:'

- en: Often it is observed that in the pursuit of rapid innovation (aka "quick fame"),
    the principles of scientific methodology are violated leading to misleading innovations,
    i.e. appealing insights that are confirmed without rigorous validation. One such
    scenario is the case that given the task of improving an algorithm to yield better
    results, you might come with several ideas with potential for improvement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An obvious human urge is to announce these ideas ASAP and ask for their implementation.
    When asked for supporting data, often limited results are shared, which are very
    likely to be impacted by selection bias (known or unknown) or a misleading global
    minima (due to lack of appropriate variety in test data).

- en: 'Data scientists do not let their human emotions overrun their logical reasoning.
    While the exact approach to prove that one improvement you''ve brought to an algorithm
    is really an improvement over not doing anything would depend on the actual case
    at hand, there are a few common guidelines:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensure that the test data has sufficient variety in order to be symbolic of
    real-life data (helps avoid overfitting)
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensure that "controlled experiment" principles are followed i.e. while comparing
    performance, the test environment (hardware, etc.) must be exactly the same while
    running original algorithm and new algorithm
  prefs:

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examine whether the results reflect local maxima/minima or global maxima/minima
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One common way to achieve the above guidelines is through A/B testing, where
    both the versions of algorithm are kept running on similar environment for a considerably
    long time and real-life input data is randomly split between the two. This approach
    is particularly common in Web Analytics.
