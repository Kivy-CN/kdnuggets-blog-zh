- en: Being able to quickly get your hands on datasets for testing algorithms and
    building models has become a vital skill for contemporary data scientists and
    machine learning engineers. Being able to move a semi-complete dataset to one
    that is fully annotated, fleshed out with additional augmented data, and ready
    to move on to building models with is equally important.

- en: For those of us holding incomplete data, and needing some help getting it from
    "not quite" to "let's go!", here are 3 projects found around GitHub that can help
    with your data acquisition, annotation, and augmentation tasks.
