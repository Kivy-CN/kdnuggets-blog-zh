- en: You might not have realized it, but this year saw an important revolution in
    the way we design and use computing resources. The change? Many businesses and
    cloud providers began shifting from traditional *central processing unit* (*CPU*)
    processing to using a *graphics processing unit* (*GPU*). GPU databases are the
    latest development in this trend, and they have the potential to completely change
    the way databases operate.

    when performing repetitive operations on large amounts of data. This is because
    GPUs can have thousands of cores and high bandwidth memory on each card.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just a year or two ago, many in the database world dismissed GPU databases as
    a fad, perhaps only applicable in small niches alongside in-memory databases.
    They said that traditional databases were still the way to go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, some innovative companies didn’t see it that way. Very quickly, the
    use of GPU databases has dramatically expanded, with installations across all
    verticals – including finance, telecoms and even the notoriously late-blooming
    government sector. Why? Put simply, GPU databases shine when used for analytics,
    and with a fraction of the investment.

- en: GPU databases are a perfect complement for Hadoop which was never designed for
    relational data analytics. One can look at the U.S. Postal service, which is now
    using a rack of GPU servers, to understand the advantage. The USPS covers 154
    million addresses spread over 200,000 delivery routes, and analyzes each carrier’s
    location data. So, you can imagine they’ve got a large database.
  prefs: []

- en: With this data, they can estimate delivery times, provide real-time notifications
    to supervisors, and optimize ad-hoc routes. Thanks to their GPU database, they
    can process these complex queries in the time it takes to load a web page. That’s
    pretty impressive.

    retail, security/IT, and even the energy industry. They’ve also seen extensive
    usage in the defense-intelligence complex.

- en: While it may seem trivial that all parts of the business may benefit from faster
    querying, faster ingests and reduced IT costs, it is really the data scientists
    who benefit the most from GPU databases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lightening fast ingest and querying means that typical cycles of data science
    work are reduced from days to hours. Other workloads may be reduced from hours
    to minutes or even seconds. Shortening these cycles for these business-critical
    data science and machine learning workloads, elevates data scientists from common
    “second-class” database users, to the primary beneficiaries of the GPU databases.

    Since each GPU features so much computing power, adding a new box is less common.
    In fact, with some GPU databases, up to 100TB of raw data can be stored and queried
    in a standard 2U server.

    requiring little data modeling and no new/expensive development and usage skills.
    Most GPU databases are often compatible with your ecosystem as well. They play
    nice with your existing data sources, data acquisition tools, and even your BI,
    reporting, analytics, and visualization tools

    are predicted to hold around 17.6 Trillion gigabytes of data by the end of the
    year. But, big data is only as useful as its rate of analysis. With fast analysis,
    your data will add value to your organization in ways you can’t yet imagine.

    thinking about the kind of GPU database that would be right for you. After all,
    the demands on your system are only going to continue to increase.
