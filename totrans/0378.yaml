  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first stream of income you can use your data science skills to generate
    revenue is data science writing. Writing is an overlooked skill in the tech community
    that can be really valuable and help you create both side and passive income.
    A very good option to start blogging on is [**Medium**](https://medium.com/) so
    as to improve your skills and start building an audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will help you generate income from the [**Medium partner program**](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Getting-started-with-the-Partner-Program)
    which can be around 1000 $ per month if you manage to reach 100 k views per month.
    This can be achieved in less than a year if you focused on it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to that you will start getting offers from other websites and online
    blogs to write for them. This will be really profitable as you can charge 100
    $ and more for one article. You can check this [list](https://medium.com/geekculture/8-websites-will-pay-50-to-1000-for-your-data-science-blog-f094d0616555?sk=df49715e8b772c1f4c3e24755499097e)
    of data science blogs that can pay you for your articles.

    good income, but it will also help you build a good personal brand and show up
    your data science skills. In addition to this, it can also be done anywhere, and
    at any time at your own pace and it can create a lot of opportunities after that
    as you will see in the coming sections.
  prefs: []

- en: Another important aspect of this is to start your own newsletter. This will
    be really helpful even if it is free. You can use the email list after that for
    advertising your product such as courses and ebooks. A good place to start a newsletter
    is on [**substack**](https://substack.com/inbox).

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second stream of income you can generate using your data science skills
    is selling data science e-books. You can start this stream of income after data
    science blogging for a while. The main reason for this is that blogging will break
    the ice between you and technical writing and will sharpen your writing skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to that, You will know what topics people are really keen on reading
    and what not. So now you have the skills, audience, and understanding of the market
    so you can use them to write e-books that really people would like to read.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can start selling your ebook on online platforms such as [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/).
    If you are doing really well you can sell your book on amazon after that to sell
    it as a hard copy. To advertise your book you can use the newsletter as mentioned
    in the previous section. In addition to that, I really recommend building your
    own website and selling your products on it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The approach I prefer in writing an ebook is to first write it as a series of
    articles on your own blog or on Medium and then convert it to an ebook. By this,
    you will avoid the pain of writing a complete book in one shot without getting
    any feedback or an indication of the book's success based on the article's stats
    and the people's interaction with it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third stream of income you can generate is by building a data science youtube
    channel. You can take this step after building a strong reputation and online
    personal brand by publishing content online and by writing blogs on a weekly basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having published written blogs will not only help you to build a good brand
    so when you publish videos you would already have a wide audience. In addition,
    you can build most of your videos on the articles you wrote before and use them
    as scripts for your videos. So you will not spend much time preparing the scripts
    and the codes for your videos. This tip will save you a lot of time and will help
    you produce more videos.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also believe that recording youtube videos will be of great help for the next
    source of income. You will break the ice between you and the camera and become
    more confident in recording long videos also will gain hands-on skills in editing
    videos and also how to create interactive videos. In addition to that, your audience
    will build good communication with you and will have more confidence in buying
    your courses as they have seen your explanation before.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fourth stream of income you can generate using your data science skills
    is by creating and selling data science courses. Since producing high-quality
    courses is a very expensive time and resources wise I really advise you to wait
    until you have a large audience to be able to sell your courses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An important tip is to try to produce courses that are more specialized and
    consistent with the personal brand you are building. So for example try to avoid
    courses that are really competitive such as machine learning basics, python for
    data scientists, and so on. Instead, focus on more specialized topics that are
    related to the topics you are focusing on before. So for example I have written
    more than 10 articles about how to optimize your python code and write more efficient
    python code. My articles got very good feedback and I built a strong brand that
    I can give very good tips on how to write optimized python code. So a very reasonable
    step is to convert this after adding more details to a short course.

- en: A final tip is to try to have ebooks for every course you create. As you will
    have the content organized and you will only invest time in creating the visual
    content.

- en: The final method you can use to monetize your data science skills is through
    mentoring and consulting. Once you have built a strong personal brand and you
    have a large audience you can offer paid long-term mentoring and one-time sessions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can offer project reviews, CV & portfolio feedback, mock interview, and
    study plan sessions. In addition to long-term mentoring in which you get your
    mentee from a certain point A to point B in his career.

    and [**Mentorcruise**](https://mentorcruise.com/). I use Calendly for the one-time
    mentoring sessions as it gives me high flexibility regarding time slots and payment
    options. I use Mentorcrusie for long-term mentoring sessions since the platform
    will handle everything between me and the mentee and ensure that we both will
    get the best out of the mentoring process.'

    data science e-books to build a youtube channel then creating data science online
    courses, and finally mentoring and consultation. Ofcourse there are other methods
    such as building data science products, freelancing, and data science competitions.
    However, I tried to share my own experince so I can provide information based
    on my practical experince.
