    in the future eventually if you are dealing with data. It’s very applied in many
    fields, like manufacturing, finance and cybersecurity.

    with values that deviate drastically from the rest of the data points. These anomalies,
    often called outliers, are a minority, while most of the items belong to the normal
    class. This means that we are dealing with an imbalanced dataset.

- en: Another challenge is that most of the time there is no labelled data when working
    in the industry and it’s challenging to interpret the predictions without any
    target. This means that you can’t use evaluation metrics typically used for classification
    models and you need to undertake other methods to interpret and trust the output
    of your model. Let’s get started!

- en: '*Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do
    not conform to expected behavior. These nonconforming patterns are often referred
    to as anomalies, outliers, discordant observations, exceptions, aberrations, surprises,
    peculiarities, or contaminants in different application domains. Credit* [*Anomaly

- en: This is a good definition of anomaly detection in a few words. Anomalies are
    often associated with errors obtained during data collection and, then, they finish
    to be eliminated. But there are also cases when there are new items with a completely
    different variability compared to the rest of the data and there is a need for
    appropriate approaches to recognize this type of observation. The identification
    of these observations can be very useful for making decisions in companies operating
    in many sectors, such as finance and manufacturing.

    when a single observation is anomalous compared to the rest of the data, so it’s
    identified as an outlier/anomaly. For example, let’s suppose that we want to make
    credit card fraud detection in the transactions of clients in a bank. In that
    case, a point anomaly can be considered a fraudulent activity of a client.

    of anomaly only in a specific context. An example can be the summer heat waves
    in the United States. You can notice that there is a huge spike in 1930, which
    represents an extreme event that happened in the United States, called Dust Bowl.
    It’s called that way because it was a period of dust storms that damaged the south-central
    United States.

- en: The third and last type of anomaly is the **collective anomaly**. The most intuitive
    example is to think about the absence of precipitations we are having this year
    from months in Italy. If we compare the data in the last 50 years, there haven’t
    ever been similar behaviours. The single data instances in an anomalous collective
    may not be identified as outliers by themselves, but all these data points together
    indicate a collective anomaly. In this context, a single day without precipitation
    is not anomalous by itself, while a lot of days without precipitation can be considered
    anomalous compared to the data of previous years.

- en: '**Isolation Forest** is an unsupervised and non-parametric technique introduced
    by Fey Tony Liu in 2012\. Like the random forest, it’s an ensemble learning method
    that trains decision trees in a parallel way. But differently from other ensemble
    methods, it is specialized in isolating the anomalies from the rest of the items.
    The assumptions behind this approach constitute the reason for the effectiveness
    of this approach: (1) the anomalies are part of a minority class compared to the
    normal data which are more numerous; (2) the anomalies tend to be found fastly
    with the shortest average path.'

    Markus M. Breuningin 2000, that detects anomalies by calculating the local density
    deviation of a specific item with respect to its neighbours.  It assumes that
    the density around an anomaly should be significantly different from the density
    around its neighbours. Moreover, the outliers should have lower density.'

    encoder and a decoder. During training, only normal data is passed to the model.
    In this way, it learns the compressed representation of normal data, which is
    supposed to be different from the representation of outliers. There is also the
    assumption that anomalous data shouldn’t be reconstructed well by the model since
    it’s completely different from normal data and, then, it should have a higher
    reconstruction error.'

    important than ever to provide an explanation of model predictions. This can be
    achieved by using interpretability approaches, like SHAP and LIME.

    As you have noticed, it’s a challenging problem to solve and the suitable technique
    changes depending on the context. I also should highlight that it’s important
    to make some explorative analysis before applying any anomaly detection model,
    like PCA to visualize the data in a lower dimensional space and boxplots. If you
    want to go deeper, check the resources below. Thanks for reading! Have a nice
