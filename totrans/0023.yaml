    aligning the roadmap to the expected business outcomes becomes challenging, given
    the evolving scope of AI initiatives.

    to technical solutions leveraging AI. They comprehend the associated complexities
    along with opportunity estimation and do not necessarily need to know the intricacies
    of algorithms.

    important to note that there are many innovative ways to solve a business problem,
    and not all of them require the use of sophisticated and advanced technology as
    that of AI.

    solve the problem to a reasonable extent.

    an inventory stock of what part of the problem is solved with the existing solution.
    If the current solution is not acceptable, then the strategists make a trade-off
    by explaining the potential increase in the efficacy of the proposed AI-powered
    solution and the risks that come with it.

    solution, fully cognizant of time, effort, cost, complexity, and the associated
    risks. It would be fair to say that an AI strategist is the linchpin to the success
    of AI transformation.

    factors to build a successful roadmap:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first one is to ensure that the proposed solution is technically feasible.
    They identify the data requirements and evaluate whether the problem at hand warrants
    the use of AI. What if data is not available or is not authorized for model training
    or does not have accurate labels? All this falls under the purview of an AI strategist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to a feasible solution, the second aspect is viability. Even if
    it is possible to scale the solution, an AI strategist wears the techno-business
    lens to assess whether the proposed model development is financially viable for
    the business objectives. If the cost-benefit analysis suggests that the estimated
    benefit from the new AI/ML model development does not justify the non-trivial
    cost of building it, then it is best advised to drop the idea.

- en: Any solution is good only if it provides value, which is often a challenge.
    Value could be in terms of a new revenue stream, a business differentiator, improved
    processes in the form of automation bringing efficiencies, and more. An AI strategist
    has a detailed methodical approach to defining the value proposition behind AI
    initiatives.

    technologies, and adapting to market shifts. So, how do we define transformation
    when innovation is a continuous thing?

    the need to revisit the legacy way of doing business. They understand that the
    status quo mode of operating a business is not sustainable, making them lose their
    competitive edge, thereby impacting their growth.

    flows down to the funnel, making experiments work at scale. That is where the
    organization benefits from the compounded knowledge of an AI strategist over time,
    who has led multiple such AI transformations at scale. They are equipped with
    a toolkit consisting of adaptive frameworks, systems, and processes, which can
    be abstracted as strategies leading to successful AI transformation.

    of boardroom discussions, it caught everyone’s attention. Specifically, for the
    reason of having too many strategies – Business, AI, and Data.

    strategy, data strategy, and now, AI strategy. Here is how the three strategies
    work together in coherence.

    clear business vision, the critical growth drivers, and a roadmap that aligns
    with the business objectives. Once the business leaders decide the “why and what”,
    next follows the “how”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An AI strategist along with technologists focuses on the how part, to achieve
    the business vision through technology. It is important to note that technology
    is just an enabler. Hence, AI strategy is derived from business strategy**,**
    which means it requires extensive time to understand the business – the moat,
    and the competitive vantage point.

    phenomenon. Hence, it works in tandem with data strategy.

    that AI teams do not give any moonshot commitment**.** This goes in line with
    the role of an AI strategist in assessing the feasibility of the proposed idea.
    AI projects bring a lot of “unknown unknowns” with them, hence it is essential
    to bake in foreseen and unforeseen risks.

    and ethical principles of building AI. Imagine having spent a huge amount of money
    building AI pipelines and workflows, data is in place and the predictions work
    just fine.

    on them, and no one can act on predictions until they trust how and where they

    (ownership if it goes rogue), and the process of data collection, transformation,
