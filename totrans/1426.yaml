- en: Major cloud providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure all offer a Data Science environment
    using a jupyter environment. For a while they were the only options for Data Scientists
    that needed the strong compute and storage capacity. Over the years new alternative
    providers have risen to provided a solitary data science environment hosted on
    the cloud for data scientist to analyze, host and share their work.

- en: MatrixDS provides a data science environment with a social network type interface
    to share their work and receive reviews of their work as well. Users can easily
    add someone else to join their project to collaborate with their peers. The platform
    also allows you to fork another persons project like GitHub and has a private
    and public mode as well. We are able upload our files directly on to the platform
    or pull from GitHub, Amazon S3, Dropbox, or Google Cloud.

- en: Saturn Cloud is a relatively brand new service co-founded in 2018 by [Hugo Shi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-shi/)
    who is also the co-founder of Anaconda. Saturn Cloud aims to be the platform where
    we can be the data scientists and they can be the data engineers. They are here
    to provide the DevOps of data science to the masses so that we can focus on the
    analysis stage as much as possible.

    gives you the ability to control and budget your costs for you and your team.
    It offers version control and parallel computing with Dask so that it is compatible
    with Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and Scikit Learn instead of having
    to use languages like Spark or Scala for distributed computing.

- en: These are two services that are becoming adopted by the wider data science community
    as an alternative to your traditional cloud providers. Sometimes for certain projects
    a full stack cloud experience may not be needed so these 2 platforms can provide
    what is only needed for our projects and not have to compromise on storage or
    compute capacity.
