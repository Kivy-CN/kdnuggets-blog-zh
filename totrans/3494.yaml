    lots of decimal places or even be negative. For some questions, especially questions
    beginning “How many…”, negative answers may have to be re-interpreted as zero
    and fractional values re-interpreted as the nearest whole number.

- en: Sometimes questions that look like multi-value classification questions are
    actually better suited to regression. For instance, “Which news story is the most
    interesting to this reader?” appears to ask for a category—a single item from
    the list of news stories. However, you can reformulate it to “How interesting
    is each story on this list to this reader?” and give each article a numerical
    score. Then it is a simple thing to identify the highest-scoring article. Questions
    of this type often occur as rankings or comparisons.

    reformulated as regression. (In fact, under the hood some algorithms reformulate
    *every* binary classification as regression.) This is especially helpful when
    an example can belong part A and part B, or have a chance of going either way.
    When an answer can be partly yes and no, probably on but possibly off, then regression
    can reflect that. Questions of this type often begin “How likely…” or “What fraction…”

- en: As you may have gathered, the families of two-class classification, multi-class
    classification, anomaly detection, and regression are all closely related. They
    all belong to the same extended family, **supervised learning**. They have a lot
    in common, and often questions can be modified and posed in more than one of them.
    What they all share is that they are built using a set labeled examples (a process
    called **training**), after which they can assign a value or category to unlabeled
    examples (a process called **scoring**).

    about how data is organized belong to **unsupervised learning**. There are a wide
    variety of techniques that try to tease out the structure of data. One family
    of these perform **clustering**, a.k.a. chunking, grouping, bunching, or segmentation.
    They seek to separate out a data set into intuitive chunks. What makes clustering
    different from supervised learning is that there is no number or name that tells
    you what group each point belongs to, what the groups represent, or even how many
    groups there should be. If supervised learning is picking out planets from among
    the stars in the night sky, then clustering is inventing constellations. Clustering
    tries to separate out data into natural “clumps,” so that a human analyst can
    more easily interpret it and explain it to others.'

    a distance metric. The distance metric can be any measurable quantity, such as
    difference in IQ, number of shared genetic base pairs, or miles-as-the-crow-flies.
    Clustering questions all try to break data into more nearly uniform groups.

- en: Another family of unsupervised learning algorithms are called **dimensionality
    reduction** techniques. Dimensionality reduction is another way to simplify the
    data, to make it both easier to communicate, faster to compute with, and easier
    to store.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At its core, dimensionality reduction is all about creating a shorthand for
    describing data points. A simple example is GPA. A college student’s academic
    strength is measured in dozens of classes by hundreds of exams and thousands of
    assignments. Each assignment says something about how well that student understands
    the course material, but a full listing of them would be way too much for any
    recruiter to digest. Luckily, you can create a shorthand just by averaging all
    the scores together. You can get away with this massive simplification because
    students who do very well on one assignment or in one class typically do well
    in others. By using GPA rather than the full portfolio, you do lose richness.
    For instance, you wouldn’t know it if the student is stronger in math than English,
    or if she scored better on take-home programming assignments than on in-class
    quizzes. But what you gain is simplicity, which makes it a lot easier to talk
    about and compare students’ strength.

- en: A third extended family of ML algorithms focuses on taking actions. These are
    called **reinforcement learning**(RL) algorithms. They are little different than
    the supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. A regression algorithm might
    predict that the high temperature will be 98 degrees tomorrow, but it doesn’t
    decide what to do about it. A RL algorithm goes the next step and chooses an action,
    such as pre-refrigerating the upper floors of the office building while the day
    is still cool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RL algorithms were originally inspired by how the brains of rats and humans
    respond to punishment and rewards. They choose actions, trying very hard to choose
    the action that will earn the greatest reward. You have to provide them with a
    set of possible actions, and they need to get feedback after each action on whether
    it was good, neutral, or a huge mistake.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically RL algorithms are a good fit for automated systems that have to make
    a lot of small decisions without a human’s guidance. Elevators, heating, cooling,
    and lighting systems are excellent candidates. RL was originally developed to
    control robots, so anything that moves on its own, from inspection drones to vacuum
    cleaners, is fair game. Questions that RL answers are always about what action
    should be taken, although the action is usually taken by machine.

    it’s so tightly integrated with the rest of the system. The upside is that most
    RL algorithms can start working without any data. They gather data as they go,
    learning from trial and error.
