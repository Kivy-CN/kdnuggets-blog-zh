    of the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast with Ben Lorica, guest Jerry Overton of [DXC
    Technology](http://www.dxc.technology/) discussed, among other things, some of
    the more non-technical issues which data practitioners must tend with, such as
    privacy, security, and ethics, as well as the current state of data science in
    businesses.

    to businesses, and that businesses had to be convinced that it was worth their
    effort to collect data and analyze it for meaningful patterns from which they
    could benefit. He then contrasted that with the views of today, noted that it
    is now understood that not using data is losing out on a potential competitive
    edge. It seems a forgone conclusion that data science is necessary to some degree,
    yet businesses now have a different set of questions. What should our data scientists
    be doing? What areas of our business should we be focusing on? How exactly can
    our data add value?

    data usage in business, where Jerry defined and outlined 4 such categories. The
    discussion was interesting, and the description of the levels, while intuitive,
    was useful, in my view. Below I have summarized the basics of these categories,
    and I would encourage everyone to listen to the entire episode for more solid
    discussion.
