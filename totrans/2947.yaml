- en: Recommendation systems are used in a variety of industries, from retail to news
    and media. If you’ve ever used a streaming service or ecommerce site that has
    surfaced recommendations for you based on what you’ve previously watched or purchased,
    you’ve interacted with a recommendation system. With the availability of large
    amounts of data, many businesses are turning to recommendation systems as a critical
    revenue driver. However, finding the right recommender algorithms can be very
    time consuming for data scientists. This is why Microsoft has provided a [GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders/tree/master/) with Python
    best practice examples to facilitate the building and evaluation of recommendation
    systems using [Azure Machine Learning services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/).

- en: 'There are two main types of recommendation systems: collaborative filtering
    and content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering (commonly used in e-commerce
    scenarios), identifies interactions between users and the items they rate in order
    to recommend new items they have not seen before. Content-based filtering (commonly
    used by streaming services) identifies features about users’ profiles or item
    descriptions to make recommendations for new content. These approaches can also
    be combined for a hybrid approach.'

    with more products/content, and it suggests products or content a customer is
    likely to purchase or engage with as a store sales associate might. Below, we’ll
    show you what this repository is, and how it eases pain points for data scientists
    building and implementing recommender systems.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key benefits of the recommender GitHub repository is that it provides
    a set of options and shows which algorithms are best for solving certain types
    of problems. It also provides a rough framework for how to switch between different
    algorithms. If model performance accuracy isn’t enough, an algorithm better suited
    for real-time results is needed, or the originally chosen algorithm isn’t the
    best fit for the type of data being used, a data scientist may want to switch
    to a different algorithm.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Selecting the right recommender algorithm from scratch and implementing new
    models for recommender systems can be costly as they require ample time for training
    and testing as well as large amounts of compute power. The recommender GitHub
    repository streamlines the selection process, reducing costs by saving data scientists
    time in testing many algorithms that are not a good fit for their projects/scenarios.
    This, coupled with [Azure’s various pricing options](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/),
    reduces data scientists’ costs on testing and organization’s costs in deployment.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When asked to build a recommender system, data scientists will often turn to
    more commonly known algorithms to alleviate the time and costs needed to choose
    and test more state-of-the-art algorithms, even if these more advanced algorithms
    may be a better fit for the project/data set. The recommender GitHub repository
    provides a library of well-known and state-of-the-art recommender algorithms that
    best fit certain scenarios. It also provides best practices that, when followed,
    make implementing more state-of-the-art algorithms easier to approach.

    train, test, optimize, and deploy recommender models on Azure and [Azure Machine
    Learning (Azure ML) service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/).
    In fact, there are [several notebooks available](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders/tree/master/notebooks#submit-an-existing-notebook-to-azure-machine-learning)on
    how to run the recommender algorithms in the repository on Azure ML service. Data
    scientists can also take any notebook that has already been created and submit
    it to Azure with minimal or no changes.
