    and graphic designers, collaborate to design software projects intensively in
    a short period of times. The goal of a hackathon is to create a functional product
    at the end of the event.

    Hackathon held by Junction Ltd. Our team made an iOS application that brings an
    optimized shopping service experience for Korean beauty product powered by image
    search engines. This application can help travelers who want to explore Korean
    beauty products but not knowing what to try due to an obvious language barrier.
    Users can find useful data about a product just by scanning it and the information
    is translated into their local languages. There is also a searching history page
    which could be utilized for further customized service. You can find more about
    it [**here**](https://devpost.com/software/skana#_=_) as well.

    in the process. So today, I’m going to talk about the 4 reasons why you should
    apply for a place in a Hackathon (especially if you’re an aspiring data scientist),
    how you should prepare and some of my tips. I hope this article can motivate you
    to go out of your comfort zone and get some profound inspiration just as I did.

- en: If you haven’t tried a hackathon or a programming competition before, and say
    you ask me if it’s worth trying, I’ll nod my head without hesitation. Here are
    the 4 reasons why you should go to a hackathon.
  prefs: []

- en: Beyond “modeling”
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We, data science learners, tend to work alone or study alone. We tend to invest
    most of our time in data preprocessing and wangling. And we pour most of our energy
    into studying machine learning or deep learning algorithms. Our project usually
    starts with importing data (or sometimes with building data by ourselves) and
    ends with the evaluation of the predictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost every real-world project in the world sadly doesn’t work that way. We
    don’t work alone. We work with other team members. From database to deployment
    and product management, all the processes should be done through collaboration.
    Having toolkits beyond the “modeling” territory can be a great plus for aspirants.
    (Many articles are pointing out this and you can find one [**here**](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-third-wave-data-scientist-1421df7433c9) as
    well) Now the important question, where can we learn and experience this?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “*Unlike competitions, nobody gives you two .csv files called train and test
    and a nicely written evaluation metric. Almost 80% of the efforts go into defining
    the problem and getting and processing data. Remaining 20% effort goes into pure
    modeling and deployment.*” - [AnalyticsVidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/05/exclusive-interview-sonny-laskar-kaggle-master-analytics-vidhya-hackathon-expert/)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A hackathon can be a great chance to collaborate with others and make a real-world
    project. Although there are some limitations, still you can learn how to communicate
    with others (who do not have much of the knowledge in machine learning as you
    do) and understand the overall workflow for releasing an actual product. And if
    you get a chance of being on the team with someone who knows a lot better than
    yourself in machine learning, I believe it’ll be such a great time to push your
    limits as well.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step of the project will be deciding what to build. And I can tell
    half of the winning chance is determined here. You should get off on the right
    foot. Implementation is also a critical point but the business value plays an
    essential role. If it’s neglected, your work can be nothing but just showing off
    how technically competent you are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“*Likewise, data scientists are hired to create business value, not just to
    build models. Ask yourself: How will the outcome of my work influence company
    decisions? What do I have to do to maximize this effect? With this entrepreneurial
    spirit, the third wave data scientist does not only produce actionable insights,
    but also seeks that they bring about real change.”* - [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-third-wave-data-scientist-1421df7433c9)'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’d have seen many people pointing out the importance of business mindset
    already. Finding a hidden need of users and observing a problem in the market.
    Suggesting a solution with your technical knowledge. Developing a service that
    can become profitable. At a hackathon, you are asked to think and discuss deeply
    with this viewpoint.

- en: I heard of a guy who had won programming competitions more than 15 times. He
    retired in his ‘prize hunting’ career after he won one of Google’s competitions.
    Do you know what his secret was? It was just business sense and a little bit of
    wit. By making a clever and creative product, he made people shout “Brilliant!”
    which definitely leaves an impression on panels. So if you’re looking for an additional
    tip for winning, having business values with some wit can be a great bonus.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of a hackathon is creating a functional product during a short period
    (commonly 2 or 3 days). You are asked to present a prototype or demo of your product
    during these days. It’s all about limited time, limited resources and limited
    energy problems. Sometimes, you could have situations where things go wrong and
    you’d have to instantly find solutions. Sometimes you have to prioritize your
    work, which means what to come first and when to stop. You could feel intense
    pressure to do all your tasks and not to be a burden on the team. And as time
    passes, becoming completely famished and exhausted is literally inevitable! (More
    like energy drain or depletion until finally “falling” asleep).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re someone like me, who tend to freeze at an extremely stressful moment,
    you’d be overwhelmed even by the air at the competition hall. It was my first
    time in a Hackathon so I experienced my brain being paralyzed several times. I
    had to get some fresh air and relax to ease off the tension. But this also became
    a great chance for me to learn how to dealing with stress. Because it’s unavoidable
    meeting those unexpected problems in the workplace and we have to manage those
    demanding moments.

    people. At a hackathon, you can meet various people from different regions and
    with different specialties but with the same interest. They can be web developers,
    app developers or designers but they are people who’re willing to invest their
    weekend in developing something cool.

- en: I met people who came from Russia to Korea just for this event. I also met a
    Ukrainian lady studying Computer Science in Korea. There were people from Denmark,
    French, China, and Japan. Meeting new people itself is a great joy. But more than
    that, I could hear what kind of pain points they have and what they are really
    passionate about. My horizon could become broadened in programming by chatting
    with fellow participants. And this is a reason why I think you should try a Hackathon
    with generous topics rather than heavily focused on the data science fields.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, it’d be good to care about what others do as well. Although you’ll be
    too busy to take extra care of others, this will help you understand the whole
    process as I mentioned above. We’re here to learn new things, anyway!

    could be how you should prepare. Actually, nothing. Just go for it. Whatever skillsets
    you have, don’t hesitate to apply for. Hackathons are not a stage only for professionals.
    But if you’d like to prepare something before the day, then I’d like to list some
    of the skills I find useful and applicable.

- en: This is not a project that starts with importing the data and ends with some
    evaluation plots. You need to collect the data and build a database according
    to your team project. After you finish with data analysis or modeling part, you
    have to pass your model to frontend. Or you might need to deploy your work on
    a web by yourself. Therefore having database and Flask in your toolkits can be
    a huge asset for this event.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re totally new to database, you can start your learning from understanding [*the
    difference between the SQL and NoSQL*](https://medium.com/xplenty-blog/the-sql-vs-nosql-difference-mysql-vs-mongodb-32c9980e67b2).
    Here is a compact [*SQL course for beginners*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaWlS9HtWYw&list=PL-osiE80TeTsKOdPrKeSOp4rN3mza8VHN) but
    there are tons of tutorials on databases besides this. So go and pick according
    to your taste.

    is easy to learn and very useful for the model deployment. Here is an excellent

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conditions could be different for each hackathon, but the one I took part in
    highly depended on API and Cloud Services. There were several sub tracks and the
    participants were asked to use particular API to participate in a given track.
    But besides this condition, you’d need to collect data by yourself anyway. Where
    will you get the data? And what about the computing power for training? You’d
    have probably left your “super-computer” with GPUs at home.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore it’d be better to have an experience of getting data from API and
    handling data in a JSON format. If you’re new to API, [*this article*](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-api-and-how-to-use-youtube-api-65525744f520?source=friends_link&sk=eedcecef15f918954df8ff6fbec0334a)can
    explain to you what API is all about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ability to use a cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud GPU is also necessary.
    Here is [*an official guide for AWS EC2*](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/)but
    here is [*a friendly video *](https://www.notion.so/Junction-X-Seoul-9320fbe9fee94e0aac0b705bbbd7e17f)by

    the competition, I slept for 4 hours in total. Sleeping less can be a good strategy
    but you need to be in good condition when you enter the hall. Also, a neck pillow
    and a blanket for a catnap can be as much useful item as “Flask” or “AWS.” ????????

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re a solo applicant, you have to build your team from the bottom. There
    can be a social network platform like Slack where you can get the information
    from other applicants and make a team before the event. You might get a chance
    to join a premade team with one opening.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have an idea on what you want to develop, divide it into parts and look
    for crew members who can take on each part. You need to find someone who has the
    skill different from us (like data modeling). The common list of members you’d
    need to have is a backend engineer, a web/app developer, and a UI/UX designer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be honest with what you can do
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might think your ability is not enough for doing this. So you might want
    to hide your level or pretend knowing more than you do. But you really don’t have
    to. Hackathons are open to everyone. And no matter how much you know about programming,
    there is a portion that can be filled only by you! Is the person next to you know
    much more than you do? Awesome! You get more chances to learn. Asking for help
    is a better way to “help” your team than struggling alone and wasting precious
    time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Enjoy, Enjoy and Enjoy!
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s more than winning. Although you should do your best during the time, don’t
    lose a smile on your face. Enjoy the time for learning, meeting new people and
    working with them. Enjoy the time for being creative and developing a new thing
    that doesn’t exist in the world. Enjoy the time for being stressed and going beyond
    your limits. It will be extremely demanding. At the end of the event, however,
    you’ll go back to your home with new thoughts and lessons on your mind even if
    you don’t win a prize. And you’d find yourself looking forward to the next Hackathon
    like me. ????
