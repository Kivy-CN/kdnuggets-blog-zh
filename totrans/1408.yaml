    data science puzzle. What are the most important constituent concepts of the data
    science landscape? How do they fit together? Which of these have been elevated
    in importance since the previous installment, and which are less important?

    be worth [having a look at this](/2017/01/data-science-puzzle-revisited.html)
    out of interest, and for comparison. We will proceed by first looking at the concept
    definitions from last time, and then look at how things have changed since then.

    start providing actual financial returns, and the challenges related to data privacy
    and security will become the big Big Data stories not only of 2017 but moving
    forward in general. In short, it's time for big returns from, and big protections

    seemed to previously demand this treatment given its near-fabled status and brand
    name-like station. Notice this time around I have reneged this status, which goes
    hand in hand with the idea that big data is no longer top level data science terminology.
    As alluded to in the final sentence, moving forward big data is simply "data,"
    and we could reword part of that excerpt to read, "*data* is the raw material
    that continues to fuel the data science revolution."

    of data science (it's right there in the name). Whether our data is big or small
    or lies somewhere else on the data sizing spectrum really doesn't require distinguishing
    from the outset. We all want to science the data and provide value, whether the
    data is a lot or a little. "Big data" may provide us with more or unique opportunities
    for the types of analytics and modeling to employ, but this seems akin to distinguishing
    the size of our nails from the get-go just so we know what size and type of hammer
    to bring along for a given job.

    like it's time we stop saying "smart" phone. The phones are all basically smart
    now, and making special note of it really says more about you than it does about
    the phone.

    and security will only grow in importance as the years march on, and we can add
    ethics into that mix as well, though seriously treating these topics is beyond
    the scope of this article.

    goal of data science is to extract insight from data, and machine learning is
    the engine which allows this process to be automated. Machine learning algorithms
    continue to facilitate the automatic improvement of computer programs from experience,
    and these algorithms are becoming increasingly vital to a variety of diverse fields.
  prefs:

    than one of the primary technical drivers of data extraction, it is the *the*
    primary technical driver.

    them in this very article. However, when thinking about extracting insight from
    data which cannot be seen with the "naked eye" via descriptive statistics or the
    visualization of these stats or some type of business intelligence reporting —
    all of which can be very useful and provide invaluable illumination in the proper
    circumstance — machine learning is the natural path to take, a path which has
    automation baked in.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deep learning is also a process; it is the application of deep neural network
    technologies -- neural network architectures (which are particular types of machine
    learning algorithms) with multiple hidden layers -- to solve problems. As a process,
    deep learning is to neural networks as data mining is to "traditional" machine
    learning (this is a somewhat flawed comparison lacking nuance, but at a very high
    level I stand by it).

- en: Deep learning is a specific type of machine learning, which is the employment
    of deep neural networks for insight extraction. Neural networks still provide
    state of the art results in a wide variety of fields — notably computer vision
    and natural language processing — which is why they are often treated distinctly
    from machine learning. While they are just a tool, they are a tool that often
    seems to prove especially useful in particular data science tasks.

    having asserted itself quite dominantly in computer vision and having its sights
    set on natural language processing, to now having completed its engulfing of NLP.
    Like in computer vision, deep learning algorithms are now not the only algorithms
    used for tackling problems, but they certainly have become some of the first choices
    for a whole host of subtasks, and for god reason.

    morphed quite dramatically over the past three years. AI seemed to be used much
    more sparingly way back then. Today, every machine learning and data science startup
    seems to be in the business of artificial intelligence, along with a whole host
    of others which employ no AI whatsoever.

    struck fear into the hearts of many (mostly related to the invasion of privacy),
    AI frightens the masses from an entirely different viewpoint, one that evokes
    SkyNet-style fears. I don''t know whether we thank the media, Elon Musk, the confounding
    of AI with deep learning and its successes, or something else entirely, but I
    don''t think the end result is escapable: this perception issue is real, and the

    to admit that there is some continually evolving "concept creep" going on any
    more, beyond the regular ol'' confusion and confounding that has always taken
    place. And that''s OK; these fields all started out as niche sub-disciplines of
    other fields (computer science, statistics, linguistics, etc.), and so their constant
    evolution should be expected. While it is important on some level to ensure that
    everyone who should have a basic understanding of their differences indeed possesses
    this understanding, when it comes to their application in fields such as data
    science, I would humbly submit that getting too far into the semantic weeds doesn''t
    provide practitioners with much benefit in the long term.'

    artificial intelligence is not what I'm wont to do. I have a vague idea of what
    I would technically classify as "artificial intelligence," as do you; our vague
    ideas may differ. The underlying current of my perception of what I consider AI,
    and its main benefit, is its unattainability. AI represents a set of vaguely defined
    lofty goals, the closer to which we get become replaced with eve more lofty goals.
