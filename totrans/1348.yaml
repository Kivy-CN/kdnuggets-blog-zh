- en: The COVID-19 pandemic has been raging for several months now and will likely
    continue for months to come. Amid this ongoing crisis, people need resources to
    stay as safe as they can for as long as they can. Data science and its related
    technologies are enabling such actions, playing an essential role in global safety.

- en: Times of hardship often serve as proving grounds for systems that people have
    boasted about in calmer days. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception, and data
    science has more than proved its value. Data, and more importantly, the way people
    use it, is shaping and refining approaches to COVID-19 safety.

- en: Data analysis is central to establishing effective policies for combating the
    spread of the virus. Politicians can't expect to enact any adequate prevention
    measures if they don't know anything about how COVID-19 is spreading through their
    area. If they turn to data scientists, on the other hand, they can gain the knowledge
    they need to make informed decisions.

    they are available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [analyzes
    various data pools](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/surveillance-data-analytics.html) to
    offer metrics like case trends, hospitalization rates and mortality reports to
    authorities. As states begin to reopen, these analytics become increasingly valuable.

- en: There's still a lot that medical professionals don't know about the virus, so
    COVID-19 safety is a developing subject. As doctors learn more about the disease,
    they find that some older practices were ineffective. For example, most doctors
    have [turned away from hydroxychloroquine](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317128/improved-covid-treatment-hospitals-remdesivir-dexamethasone)
    in favor of drugs like remdesivir and dexamethasone.

- en: Data science can go beyond suggesting medical approaches and show if current
    ones work or not. As authorities continue to implement new practices, they need
    to keep an eye on data to see if these methods are useful. Better data analytics
    can provide more conclusive answers about what is and isn't working.

    pandemic. Last-mile deliveries have [increased more than tenfold](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-transport-infrastructure/our-insights/us-freight-after-covid-19-whats-next)
    as people order necessities instead of leaving the house to shop. With more perishable
    goods like groceries moving through the mail, companies need data science to ensure
    product quality.

    minus 65 degrees](https://klingecorp.com/sushi-transport-containers/ultra-low-temperature-dual-redundant-freezer-container/)
    Celsius, or they could compromise the items inside. Data scientists can help companies
    create smart monitoring systems to make sure these containers maintain the proper
    environment. Without the right data tools, shipped groceries, vaccines and plants
    could spoil en route.

- en: Amid all the confusion of the pandemic, misinformation has seen an outbreak
    of its own. Incorrect information can be a threat to COVID-19 safety, but data
    science can help. Social media users generate too much data for a human moderator
    to monitor, but machine-learning-based analytic tools can flag potentially false
    information.

    like hate speech or that which calls for violence. In the same way, this technology
    can highlight statements that could be false or misleading. By comparing social
    media posts to data sets to scientifically accepted truths, these tools can find
    and flag misinformation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most critical steps in COVID-19 safety is contact tracing. Some of
    the most effective instances of contact tracing have taken advantage of data science
    techniques. Countries like South Korea have established systems that [analyze
    government data on infections](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-digital-contact-tracing-slowed-covid-19-in-east-asia)
    to alert users if they might've been exposed to the virus.

- en: These apps need to employ data science techniques like data acquisition, cleansing
    and masking to work correctly. Data scientists can lend their expertise to app
    developers and researchers to help create a functioning contact tracing network.
    With these tools, numerous areas can take more control over slowing the spread
    of the virus.

    offering — information. If authorities and citizens are to respond to the pandemic
    appropriately, they need to understand the situation as a whole. Data science
    enables people to draw a more cohesive picture from raw data, bolstering the fight
    against COVID-19.
