    Here are a few common traps that data scientists can avoid.

- en: There’s no doubt that predictive modeling is a big upside of data science —
    especially during those frequent instances when we know that the result is out
    of our control so predicting it is all we can do. But why only limit data science
    to predictions?

    retention offers to those most at risk? Or should we understand why people are
    likely to churn and make them happier customers in the first place?

    drivers. This is obviously easier said than done, given finding the root causes
    of your open-ended problem is much more complex than building a model. If you
    want to shape the future instead of being shaped by it, you need to [**discover
    what drives your problem**](https://www.sparkbeyond.com/demo/?utm_source=KDNuggets&utm_medium=Sponsored_Blog&utm_campaign=13_Sep_2021).

    is often, “What is my target variable?” This isn’t as trivial a question as you
    may think.

    for example. We’d want to know which claims are overall low risk and can be fast-tracked.
    In addition, we’d also want to know which would need to go through triage with
    another insurer, or which ones are likely uncovered. Each of these objectives
    typically has different drivers, and using traditional methods, exploring five
    use cases will require you to put in five times the effort. In order to create
    sustainable business impact, this is not enough.

    models on up-to-date data. Recalibration only allows your models to correctly
    interpret the information presented to them — the information encoded in the features
    that the data scientist provides. But what about the information that was discarded
    or ignored by the data scientist, because, in the past, it did not matter?
