    pretty much any industry.

- en: Its ability to “outthink” humans is touted as a magical ROI booster that can
    drastically maximize productivity while minimizing resource expenditure. The security
    industry is no different. With internet-scale attack campaigns overwhelming security
    teams that struggle to process alerts quickly enough amidst oceans of data, machine
    learning was supposed to be the silver bullet for any modern cybersecurity problem.
    However, with great hype often comes great disappointment and we’re now experiencing
    the blowback from a growing number of people who believe it has not at all lived
    up to expectation.

- en: The truth is, machine learning is no silver bullet. However, that doesn’t mean
    it’s not immensely helpful to security programs and crucial to the future of cybersecurity,
    people just need to reconsider the way they use it. Rather than treating it as
    an all-powerful robot overlord, the secret to unlocking its potential is treating
    it as a very junior employee.

    any common sense. Just like any intern on their first day, you wouldn’t assume
    it knows how your organization works, nor, necessarily, the concepts you hope
    it will eventually master. When you start with machine learning program, think
    of it as an onboarding process. In the beginning, you need to check in on your
    models frequently and spend a lot of time getting them started in the right direction.
    At first, the models, which you hope will drive your business to new heights by
    processing terabytes of data at awesome speed, won’t even understand the task
    you’re asking of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning’s inability to think critically is probably the source of most
    of the disappointment and why humans need to have a very prominent role in the
    machine-learning age of cyber security. Because your models are low-level (but
    diligent) taskmasters that can’t see the big picture, you need to continually
    spoon feed them instructions. Over time, they’ll eventually see patterns based
    on your feedback and begin to get the hang of what you want them to look for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As your models learn, you’ll need to check in on them less and less, but they
    can and should never be completely autonomous. They don’t see things the way you
    see them and don’t follow a thought process like our own. They can quickly stray
    away from the task at hand, sending your entire program into disarray.

- en: Once you think your model is performing well, you need a few things to make
    sure it doesn’t go off the rails. Before you go and build a pipeline, make sure
    you have the proper safety nets in place. The first of these safety nets is what
    we call a tripwire. If your model exceeds your expectation of the number of instances
    it will classify within a certain period, your tripwire will automatically disable
    it. This measure is critical to prevent your model from running out of control.

- en: Going rogue is extremely common for models when they’re first released because,
    although you’ve provided your initial model a pristine, hand-curated data set
    from which to learn, the real world is really dirty, dirty in ways you could never
    anticipate. Just like a fresh college graduate, your model will encounter things
    that didn’t appear in its textbook, causing it to default to biases formed through
    its training data.

- en: For example, if your training data only contains cats and dogs, when you provide
    it with a fish, it will try to classify it as either a cat or dog. Unlike a human
    with common sense, your model will need to be corrected, learn from its mistakes
    and try again. The algorithm used to train your model also has inherent biases.
    Just like people, every model creates its own view of the problem. At first, it
    makes assumptions that over simplify the solution (we’ll get into this later).

- en: The next safety net is a whitelist. These are lists of items your models should
    ignore. In a perfect world, you wouldn’t need whitelists because you would invest
    the time engineering better features and retraining your model until it gets a
    specific example right. However, when you need to act now, you will be thankful
    you have them. While not ideal, whitelists not only prevent your current model
    from classifying an instance incorrectly, but it also helps your future models.

- en: Your model may to work at first, but without proper feedback, its performance
    will degrade over time (the precision during the first week will be better than
    on the tenth week). How long it takes the model to degrade to an unacceptable
    level depends on your tolerance and its ability to generalize to the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The world changes all the time and it’s important that your model changes with
    it. If you need your model to keep up with current trends, selecting an [instance-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance-based_learning)
    model or a model that can learn incrementally, is critical. Just as providing
    frequent feedback helps an employee learn and grow, your model needs the same
    kind of feedback.

- en: Active learning places an expert in the loop. When the model is unsure how to
    categorize a certain instance, having the ability to ask for help is critical.
    Models typically provide a probability or score with their prediction, which get
    turned into a binary decision based on some threshold you’ve provided (i.e. threat
    or not a threat).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But with no guidance, things get problematic and quick. Imagine a junior security
    researcher that doesn’t know how to assess a certain threat. They think something
    might be malicious, but they aren’t quite sure. They fire off an email to you
    requesting help, but that email doesn’t get answered for a month or more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Left to its own devices, the employee may make an incorrect assumption. In the
    case where the instance was just below the cutoff, but the threat was real, the
    model will continue to ignore it, resulting in a potentially serious false negative.
    However, if it chose to act, the model will continue to flag benign instances
    generating a flood of false positives. Developing a feedback mechanism that provides
    your model with the ability to identify and surface questionable items is critical
    to the success of your model.

    surround themselves with “yes-men” or lone wolves decide they can do better by
    themselves, ideas stagnate. Machine learning models are no different. Data scientists
    have their “go-to” algorithm to train their models. It’s important to not only
    try other algorithms but try other algorithms together.

    With some work, machine learning can be used to leverage your employees’ knowledge
    and abilities to fill a necessary gap in the talent pool. However, machine learning
    models are not something you can set and forget. They need frequent feedback and
    monitoring to provide you with the best performance. Do yourself a favor and make
    providing that feedback easy. The time you invest in it will pay dividends.
