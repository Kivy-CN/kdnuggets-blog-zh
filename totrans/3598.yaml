- en: Interactive notebooks, such as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org), are essential
    for artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) development, but are ill-suited
    for production environments. Therefore converting notebooks to a well-designed
    software system is a mandatory step in every ML project. But there is a notable
    lack of tooling to assist developers with such translation, beyond the basic [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    utility.

- en: Even before Jupyter was developed, mathematicians, researchers and analysts
    used interactive “notebook style” development environments (for example [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)).
    For data exploration and statistical analysis, immediate feedback and visualization
    is essential to know if a given workflow will lead to a working model.

    Jupyter alternative notebooks like [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com) and [Hex](https://hex.tech);
    cron schedulers like [PaperMill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/);
    and full-service cloud setups like Databricks. However, all of these tools have
    one thing in common: they are built around notebooks and assist in *using* notebooks
    in production settings. When using any of these tools, you’ll run into two issues:
    1.) the code structure in the notebook is the same (usually a poorly maintainable
    “spaghetti code”) and 2.) the environment the notebook is scheduled to run in
    is the notebook kernel (programming language interpreter optimized for developer
    interactivity instead of runtime efficiency).'

    science and the rest of the enterprise stack. For example, a typical marketing

    the weakest link.

    the production stack to adequately address respective areas of concern. Existing
    tools that try to do both have proven to only compromise both environments. Asking
    data scientists to be more mindful of engineering concerns during development
    substantially reduces workflow productivity. And it’s not realistic to fundamentally
    change the way data science operates. So the question is: is it possible to bridge
    the gap with a single tool?'

    but was built with this tooling gap specifically in mind. It gives data scientists
    a way to work exactly as they do now, while also reaping the benefits of the good
    engineering ‘stuff’ that comes with the production stack. LineaPy doesn’t try
    to change the data science or the production stack environments, but rather attempts
    to act as a much needed bridge (It can be used in interactive computing environments
    like Jupyter Notebook/Lab or IPython).'

- en: The existence of a tool like LineaPy shows that it’s possible to respect the
    separation of concerns while still closing the gap between development and production.
    In general, we should avoid jury rigging existing tools that serve clearly defined
    purposes to do something else. When we do this, we create more frustrations than
    the problems we’re solving.
