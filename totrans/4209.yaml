    and you stumble across this article, you may be wondering, “How can Python help
    in finance?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You, like me, may be surprised to learn that you should learn to code altogether
    – and even more surprised to learn that the best language for finance is a popular
    data science language, Python. Learning financial programming with Python is becoming
    a requirement.

- en: Finance and banking have a reputation for very high salaries, so the job field
    attracts a large number of applicants. If you’re one of them, you should know
    Python is hugely popular for finance — and still growing in popularity. Python
    is widely used in risk management, the creation of trading bots, quantitative
    finance for analyzing big financial data, and more.

    you’ll already know the reasons Python rules in general so I’ll save you time
    and condense them into a single bullet: Python is fast for both beginner and experienced
    coders to learn. It’s easy to read as it has a clear and simple syntax. It’s quick
    to deploy – you can build working code in just a few lines.'

    make Python great for anything else. If you want to analyze financial data with
    Python, you’ll be pleased to hear it’s a breeze to start.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python as a language is bolstered by libraries, AKA reusable chunks of code
    someone else already built for you. Beyond being simple to pick up, there’s a
    robust framework of open-source, third-party libraries that are useful in all
    sorts of situations but specifically for finance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Libraries like Scikit and Pybrain are especially useful in the finance world.
    Some people consider the Python finance libraries “shortcuts” already since you
    don’t have to code that functionality from scratch. I’d agree. Financial data
    analysis with Python is a lot quicker with these libraries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scipy, NumPy, Matplotlib, and a range of other add-ons make it easier than ever
    to perform and visualize financial calculations and algorithms. Importantly, these
    help you not only work with the data, but more easily communicate the results
    to key decision-makers.

    a relatively new use of the language, there are already a ton of resources that
    can help you get started and smooth your way in. This is because Python has been
    in use generally for decades. A lot of the same resources that made Python great
    for data science can make your finance experience better too.

    were in sports leagues), I’m talking about minimum viable products in this section.
    The finance sector prizes agility and responsiveness as it’s customer-facing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In finance, programmers should be able to quickly create a prototype that can
    be tested. A company can use an MVP to determine market fit and get the idea off
    the ground that way. Python is a dream language to spin up quick MVPs for testing.
  prefs: []

- en: If your finance company is a startup, Python is valuable because it helps developers
    create products quickly and flexibly without wasting resources. If it’s an established
    corporation, Python is valuable because it increases agility and helps encourage
    innovation, which is critical for bigger, slower companies. Either way, it’s a
    great tool for your team.

    around for three decades; plenty of finance companies have already invested in
    building infrastructure and long-term projects with Python, and most tellingly,
    there are new applications of Python for finance coming out every year, like Dash
    for cryptocurrency as you’ll learn in section nine.

    surprised to learn that Python is becoming a key player in the cryptocurrency

    Python) and [found 327 packages](https://libraries.io/search?keywords=blockchain&languages=Python) that
    deal with cryptocurrency and blockchains.

    it is to use Python to retrieve and analyze cryptocurrency pricing. If you’re
    invested in the cryptocurrency scene, Python is a must for you.

    language to learn. It’s no longer enough to rely on existing products that are
    built on Python for financial companies and jobs – more and more, employees are
    expected to know Python for finance in everyday use.
  prefs: []

    on and more finance workers learn Python, that number will only grow. If you were
    also unclear on if Python is good for finance, hopefully this article has cleared
    up the answer for you.
