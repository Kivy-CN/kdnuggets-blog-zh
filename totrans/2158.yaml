- en: A lot has happened in the year 2023\. We’ve seen the growth and emergence of
    Large Language Models (LLMs) and their particular use as fundamental controllers
    for autonomous agents. We’ve seen it for ourselves, many people have adopted these
    autonomous agents, and integrated them into organizations and more companies are
    interested in LLMs.
