    is poised to make a transformative impact on data science in 2017\. At the University
    of Pennsylvania, we’ve been working hard to develop [TPOT](https://github.com/rhiever/tpot),
    a state-of-the-art open source AutoML tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines
    for supervised learning problems.'

- en: Over the next couple months, we’re going to challenge you to apply TPOT to any
    data science problem you find interesting on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
    If your entry ranks in the top 25% of the leaderboard on a Kaggle problem, we
    want to see how TPOT helped you accomplish that.

    them, and award (monetary!) prizes to the top 3 entries: $500, $250, $100\. We’ll
    also post a write-up highlighting the best entries after the competition.'
  prefs: []

    well as the technical write-up provided with the entry.

- en: If you’re new to TPOT and AutoML, you’re in luck! We’ve written [extensive documentation](http://rhiever.github.io/tpot/)
    describing how to use TPOT, as well as a [User Guide](http://rhiever.github.io/tpot/using/)
    and [API documentation](http://rhiever.github.io/tpot/api/). To give you a starting
    point, below is basic example applying TPOT to scikit-learn’s MNIST dataset.
  prefs: []

- en: This Python code will fit TPOT on the training data, score it on the testing
    data, then export the optimized pipeline as Python code to the file “tpot_mnist_pipeline.py”.

- en: Importantly, the machine learning algorithms that TPOT uses can be heavily customized.
    Essentially, **TPOT can optimize pipelines for any machine learning algorithm**
    that follows the [scikit-learn interface](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects).
    You can read more about customizing TPOT’s configuration in the User Guide [here](http://rhiever.github.io/tpot/using/#customizing-tpots-operators-and-parameters).

    that are running on their web site. One of the classic Kaggle problems is the
    [Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), where you’re tasked to
    use machine learning to predict the survivors of the Titanic disaster.

    using TPOT.
