- en: Data Science enthusiasts are often self-taught at first instead of a master's
    degree taken later on. But, the reality of the vast field of Data Science is realized
    later on by beginners in the field, and the really valuable time is spent in the
    wrong way of learning. In this article, I will share few facts I learned through
    my journey of learning data science over the course of 2 years, which could help
    you learn in a better way.

    field. Never expect to complete learning in a few months or by doing online courses.
    Research and development happen quite frequently, so be ready for a long time
    of learning. Also, do understand the fact that real-world data science is quite
    different from what we do by ourselves, but keep what you learn in memory.

    calculus, statistics, and linear algebra) is good. You do not necessarily need
    to go very deep into the subjects, but the basic understanding will be a great
    plus point when solving data problems. The majority of the workload from math
    calculations is done by libraries.

- en: The most common mistake is jumping directly into machine learning, kick-starting
    the learning from there, only in the reverse way. Machine learning is the last
    part of any data science process. Starting your learning from here will make you
    miss out on a lot of more important concepts — data loading and management, exploratory
    analysis, and data engineering. Start by learning Python, lading data, and working
    with datasets (pandas), then move on to generating dashboards and visualizations,
    and then move on to Machine Learning and predictive modelling. This [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/data-science-process-a-brief-overview-18ad34bd812f?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------) explains
    the general data science process.

    Kaggle is the site where you can find datasets — you can use that and work on
    Data Science skills. But do keep one thing in mind: if you are a beginner, start
    working on basic and small datasets with simpler tasks, and then move on to competitions.
    The reason is that Kaggle is a public platform where you may find industry experts
    and researchers. Their level of knowledge will be different from what you have
    as a rookie — so work on your own by starting with basic datasets and then moving
    on to complex modelling problems or competitions.'

    business. Moreover, understanding the business problem is often termed as “The
    first rule of Data Science.” The best advice out there is to work on datasets
    and projects that solve a problem rather than generating visualizations and models.
    The “Cats vs. Dogs” dataset is all good for learning and trying out things but
    not as a project or work.

    library or API! Learn what is necessary on-demand.
