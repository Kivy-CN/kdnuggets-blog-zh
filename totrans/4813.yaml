    you can see in the image above. 68% of the data is within 1 standard deviation
    (σ) of the mean (μ), 95% of the data is within 2 standard deviations (σ) of the
    mean (μ), and 99.7% of the data is within 3 standard deviations (σ) of the mean
    (μ).

    be more interpretable for your future endeavors. As always, the code used to derive
    to make everything (including the graphs) is available on my [github](https://github.com/mGalarnyk/Python_Tutorials/blob/master/Statistics/normal_Distribution_Area_Under_Curve.ipynb).
    With that, let’s get started!

    know about the probability density function (PDF). A PDF is used to specify the
    probability of the [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) falling *within
    a particular range of values*, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability
    is given by the [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral) of this variable’s
    PDF over that range — that is, it is given by the area under the density function
    but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the
    range. This definition might not make much sense so let’s clear it up by graphing
    the probability density function for a normal distribution. The equation below
    is the probability density function for a normal distribution

- en: The graph above does not show you the *probability* of events but their *probability
    density. *To get the probability of an event within a given range we will need
    to integrate. Suppose we are interested in finding the probability of a random
    data point landing within 1 standard deviation of the mean, we need to integrate
    from -1 to 1\. This can be done with SciPy.
