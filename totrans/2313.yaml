    incomplete information. These faults may be due to the human element (incorrectly
    filled or unfilled surveys) or technology (malfunctioning sensors). Whatever the
    case is, you are often left with missing values or information.

    set may be deemed unusable. But since it takes considerable time, effort, and
    (in many cases) money to [acquire high-quality data](/2022/12/collect-data-customer-sentiment-analysis.html),
    disposing of the incorrect data and starting again may not be viable options.

    to allow the data set to be still usable. Data imputation is one of the most reliable
    techniques for achieving this. However, we must first identify what type of data
    is missing and why.

    deletion. This involves deleting records with missing information or values. The
    main advantage of list-wise deletion is that it supports all three categories
    of missing data.
  prefs: []

    only use [listwise deletion](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/pairwise-vs-listwise-deletion-what-are-they-and-when-should-i-use-them)
    in instances where there are a greater number of missing (observed) values than
    present (observed) values, mainly because there isn’t enough data to infer or
    replace them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the observed missing data isn’t important (ignorable) and only a few values
    are missing, you can ignore them and work with what you have. However, this isn’t
    always a possibility. Data imputation offers a third and potentially more viable
    solution.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MI is a form of simple imputation. This involves calculating the mean of the
    observed values and using the results to infer the missing values. Unfortunately,
    this method has been proven to be inefficient. It can lead to many biased estimates,
    even when the data is missing completely at random. Additionally, the “accuracy”
    of the estimations depends on the number of missing values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, if there is a great number of missing observed values, [using
    mean imputation](/2020/09/missing-value-imputation-review.html) could lead to
    value underestimation. Thus, it’s better suited for data sets and variables with
    only a few missing values.

    data set to replace the missing values. It’s a single imputation method that relies
    on the memory or knowledge of the operator and is sometimes referred to as prior
    knowledge of an ideal number. Accuracy hinges on the operator’s ability to recall
    the values, so this method may be more suitable for data sets with only a few
    missing values.

    specified as Y) to a collection of independent variables (usually denoted as X).
    Linear regression is the most well-known form of regression. It uses the line
    of best fit to predict or determine the missing value. Consequently, it’s the
    best method for representing data visually through a regression model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When linear regression is a form of deterministic regression where an exact
    relationship between the missing and present values is established, the missing
    values are replaced with the 100% prediction of the regression model. There is
    a limitation to this method, however. Deterministic linear regression can often
    result in an overestimation of the closeness of the relationship between the values.

- en: Stochastic [linear regression](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/what-is-linear-regression/)
    compensates for the “over-preciseness” of deterministic regression by introducing
    a (random) error term because two situations or variables are seldom perfectly
    connected. This makes filling in missing values using regression more appropriate.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach involves selecting a randomly chosen value from a subject with
    other values similar to the subject missing the value. It requires you to search
    for subjects or individuals and then fill in the missing data using their values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The hot deck sampling method limits the range of attainable values. For instance,
    if your sample is restricted to an age group between 20 and 25, your result will
    always be between these numbers, increasing the potential accuracy of the replacement
    value. The subjects/individuals for this method of imputation are chosen at random.

    identical values for all other variables/parameters in the data set. For example,
    the subject may have the same height, cultural background, and age as the subject
    whose values are missing. It differs from hot deck sampling in that the subjects
    are systematically chosen and reused.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While there are many options and techniques for dealing with missing data, prevention
    is always better than a cure. Researchers must implement stringent [planning for
    experiments](/2020/09/design-experiments-data-science.html) and studies. The study
    must have a clear mission statement or goal in mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often, researchers overcomplicate a study or fail to plan against impediments,
    which results in missing or insufficient data. It’s always best to simplify the
    design of the study while placing a precise focus on data collection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Collect only the data you need to meet the study’s goals and nothing more. You
    should also ensure that all instruments and sensors involved in the study or experiments
    are fully functional at all times. Consider creating regular backups of your data/responses
    as the study progresses.
