    data, providing intuitive geographic data handling in Pandas DataFrames. It supports
    formats like Shapefiles and GeoJSON and offers spatial operations such as merging,
    grouping, and spatial joins. Geopandas integrates seamlessly with popular libraries
    like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It can handle large datasets, but this can
    pose challenges. Geopandas package is commonly used for spatial data analysis
    tasks, including spatial joins, queries, and geospatial operations like buffering
    and intersection analysis. Geopandas requires different packages like Shapely
    to handle geometric operations, Fiona to access files, and matplotlib for plotting.
