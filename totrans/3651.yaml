    imagination is the limit. Today, WavJourney can automate the art of storytelling.
    Given a single prompt, WavJourney leverages the power of LLMs to generate grasping
    audio scripts, complete with an accurate storyline, lifelike human voices, and
    engaging background music.

    We only need to provide a simple instruction, describing a scenario and scene
    setting, and the model generates a gripping audio script highlighting the supreme
    context relevance to the original instruction.

- en: 'WavJourney utilizes GPT-4 model with a predefined prompt template to generate
    the script. The prompt templates restrict the output to be in a simple JSON format,
    that can easily be parsed later by a computer program. Each script has 3 different
    audio types as shown in the image above: **Speech**, **sound effects**, and **music**.
    Each audio type can then be run as foreground audio, or overlaid as a background
    sound effect over other audio. Other attributes such as content description, length,
    and character are sufficient attributes to formally define an audio setting for
    script generation.'

    relevant information from the predefined JSON script format. It associates each
    description and character to a preset speech audio. This process helps in breaking
    down the audio generation process into separate steps, that include text-to-speech,
    music, and sound addition.

    generated that is overlaid by background music and sound effects. For speech generation,
    the model uses the pre-trained [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) model and
    a [VoiceFixer](https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer) restoration model to improve
    audio quality. [AudioLDM](https://audioldm.github.io/) and [MusicGen](https://ai.honu.io/papers/musicgen/)
    models are utilized for sound effects and music overlays. The outputs of all three
    models are combined for the final audio output.
