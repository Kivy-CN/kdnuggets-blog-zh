- en: KDnuggets recently brought you the [Top YouTube Channels for Data Science](/2021/03/top-youtube-channels-data-science.html),
    employing a qualitative approach to identifying those channels of value on the
    platform. As the endeavour seemed to be be useful to some of our readers, we have
    repeated the exercise, this time bringing you the top machine learning channels
    that YouTube has to offer.

    We have maintained our quantitative approach, but tweaked the specifics. (Also,
    we fully recognize that the act of creating a criteria is a form of subjectivity,
    but realistically some decisions need to be made.) This time around, determining
    which channels ended up on our list began with this YouTube search criteria:'

    post. However, one channel was removed in an act of subjectivity given some of
    the channel creator's recent controversies. While we wish the individual well,
    we could not in good faith include their content in our recommendations list.
