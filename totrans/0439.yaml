    to clock in and out on a daily basis. You can handpick tasks to work on, and reject

    wherever and whenever you want. You get to save a lot on expenses like petrol
    and food since you don’t need to travel to the office everyday. If you find that
    you’re working on repetitive and boring tasks, you have the opportunity to switch
    things up and only accept projects that excite you.

    scientists on a freelance basis.
  prefs: []

    freelancers. They generally don’t require data scientists, and don’t have a proper
    data pipeline in place.
  prefs: []

    They would prefer to hire employees on a full-time basis, and almost never hire
    freelancers.

    writers, and designers, and only a handful of opportunities for data scientists.

    will need to constantly source for jobs in a space where there aren’t many, and
    where supply tends to exceed demand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This being said, however, you can get creative with the services you offer as
    a freelance data scientist. You don’t need to limit yourself to building machine
    learning models for organizations. There are many other areas that intersect with
    the skillset of a data scientist that you can take advantage of to land more freelance
    opportunities.

    would help him improve an existing model that predicted which stock to invest
    in.
  prefs: []

    small to mid-sized organizations don’t have enough data available to do this,
    especially during their initial stages.

    trends. These patterns can then tell you who these companies should be targeting,
    the types of products that should be promoted, when these products should be released,
    and how they should be advertised to different people.

    They have tutorials on almost every topic in data science. Their tutorials are
    very easy to understand, even if you are a beginner in the field. Every step is
    clearly outlined, and the code examples always include an explanation as to why
    things are being done a certain way.

    blindly copy pasting code that they don’t understand. They actually gain knowledge
    of the topic by the time they complete the tutorial, and will definitely go back
    to the same site the next time they want to learn something.

    the past. Apart from the above, I’ve also built machine learning models for companies
    on a one-off basis. This was a more complicated task than I expected, since these
    organizations are pretty small and their data isn’t cleaned or stored properly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tables, how database access could be automated so the model could run each time,
    and cleaning the data so it could easily be queried.

    of my articles or posts on social media.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    more likely to hire you if you are highly recommended by someone they are close
    to, as opposed to taking the risk of hiring an applicant who uploaded their resume
    on a job portal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    more of them. The more jobs you successfully complete, the higher your profile
    will rank on platforms like Upwork.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will provide future employers with confidence that you can get the job done, and
    increases your chances of getting hired.

    In the beginning, it makes sense to charge slightly lower to build up your portfolio.
    As you start gaining more expertise and more jobs start coming in, you can gradually
    increase your rates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I wasn’t aware of this when I first started freelancing, and did a lot of work
    for a fraction of the market price.

    of working with them, I asked if this could be increased to $70\. They negotiated
    and lowballed, and settled on $60.
  prefs: []

    worth the effort I was putting in, and I decided to direct my energy towards tasks
    that added value.

    provided in this article was useful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember, it isn’t wise to leave your full-time job and start freelancing immediately.
    I suggest creating a portfolio first and taking up freelance roles on a part-time
    basis. Once you constantly have a steady stream of jobs coming in and establish
    a certain level of stability, then you can make the transition towards becoming
    a full-time freelancer.
