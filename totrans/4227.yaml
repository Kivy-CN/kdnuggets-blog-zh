- en: Django is a free, open-source, high-level Python web framework that facilitates
    rapid development and pragmatic & clean code. It was created to support [web application
    development](https://scalexcloud.com/digital-applications/web-app-development/),
    web APIs, and web services. It utilizes the principles of MVC (Model-View-Controller)
    architecture and its primary aim is to ease the development of complex and database-driven
    websites. With the Django framework, web developers can focus on creating unique
    applications that are feature-rich, fast, secure, and scalable and benefit from
    greater flexibility than using a web development tool. Django takes care of a
    lot of hassles involved in web development, it enables users to focus on developing
    components needed for their application rather than spending time on already developed
    components

    of this programming language. It is considered to be quite easy to both use and
    read, and it’s ideal for machine learning. Python is really easy to learn and

    everything to develop a full-fledged application. These batteries include ORM,
    Authentication, session management support, HTML templating, URL routing, Middlewares,
    HTTP libraries, Multi-site support, template engine, forms, view layers, model
    layers, Python compatibility, and more. This aspect speeds up the development
    as developers simply don’t need to implement this basic stuff.

    protect your application and your users. It helps developers avoid many common
    security mistakes by providing a framework that has been engineered to do the
    right things to protect the website automatically. Django is usually the first
    one to respond to vulnerabilities and alert other frameworks.

    on your application. Django enables any application to handle any audience volume
    growth with efficiency. It includes a series of default components that can be
    unplugged and replaced for more specific solutions. As Django is a very popular
    and widely used web application framework across the industries, a lot of cloud
    service providers are taking all measures to deploy the application fast and easily
    on their platforms. This makes it easy for developers to develop more functional,
    reliable, and efficient applications.
