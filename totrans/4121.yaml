    using Pandas, and nor should you look for one. Pandas is rich in functionality,
    is incredibly powerful, and provides robust flexibility. Want to inspect data?
    Pandas can help. Need to query data? Pandas has you covered. Have to prepare tabular
    data for machine learning? Pandas is here for you.

    operations needed to start querying and modifying DataFrames, the basic data structure
    of the library. It will show you how to create DataFrames, import and export data
    to and from them, inspect the DataFrames, as well subset, query, and reshape the
    DataFrames. Once you master these introductory operations, you should be ready
    for more advanced Pandas tasks.

    breadth of operations and the at-first intimidating syntax. But by taking it step
    by step, mastering the basics, and keeping a reference handy while you practice
    (like, say, this cheatsheet), you will be making progress with Python's most data
    processing ubiquitous library in no time.
