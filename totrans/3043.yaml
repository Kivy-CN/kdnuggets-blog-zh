    in 2016 to $8.81 Billion USD by 2022, it can almost be said that machine learning
    is taking over the world. With that, there is a growing need for professionals
    who know the ins and out of machine learning.

    machine learning patents grew at a 34 percent Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
    between 2013 and 2017, which is the third-fastest growing category of all patents
    granted. Also, the International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts that spending
    on AI and ML will increase from $12 Billion USD in 2017 to $57.6 Billion USD by
    2021\. Even [Deloitte Global](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/technologymediatelecommunications/gx-deloitte-tmt-2018-intense-machine-learning-report.pdf)
    predicts that the number of machine learning pilots and implementations will double
    in 2018 compared to 2017, and double again by 2020.

    is by enrolling in an online education program or taking an online course. There
    are several online course providers in the market, and different modes of online
    study. You can opt for self-learning courses or virtual classroom courses, or
    those which blend the two. One of the main benefits of online learning is the
    flexibility it provides.You can learn at any hour of the day and when it is most
    convenient for you, unlike traditional classroom learning. Also, online learning
    can save you a lot of time, since you won’t have to travel to a physical location
    to attend classes. You do, however, need a good, stable internet connection. Depending
    on the specific program you enroll in, you may also need to be comfortable with
    interacting with others online over video or chat sessions.

    you won’t get the same flexibility in schedule that you would with online courses.
    Additionally, university degree courses are often not optimal when it comes to
    developing practical skills. This is because the focus is a lot more on the academic
    foundations, rather than interacting and working with industry professionals.
    And when it comes to enrolling in a college course, it usually means pursuing
    a two or four-year degree.

    this amount of higher education. Attending a technical school or receiving online
    certification is often more than sufficient. In fact, many industry professionals
    tend to agree that shorter, more condensed learning is actually better, because
    you are focusing solely on what you want to learn. This also means you finish
    your program much faster.

    through online blogs and materials. There are also some great resources on YouTube,
    like this [Machine Learning Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEiEAq2VkUULYYgj13YHUWmRePqiu8Ddy)
    by Simplilearn, which provides excellent foundation level videos on machine learning.
    But the biggest drawback of learning through self-study is that it will take a
    lot longer to learn the basics, and you might end up making avoidable, but very
    costly mistakes. You also don’t get the opportunity  to learn from and interact
    with industry professionals. You may find it difficult to manage your time when
    it comes to self-study as well.

    is great when you are looking to achieve specific career goals in a short period
    of time. Focused courses geared toward various projects can teach you how you
    can apply machine learning in real life. Projects like building a predictive model
    for housing prices, building a phishing website detector using LR algorithms or
    KNN algorithms, or building an MNIST Classifier provides curated content for professionals
    to upskill in those specific areas versus a broad education. University degrees
    also have a much longer, undefined return on investment, as they are not always
    geared towards specific goals.

    will generally take between one to six months to complete, depending on your goals.
    A degree from a university, on the other hand, can take up to four years or more.
    If you are looking to further your education with a professional degree, you are
    looking at more time on top of that. It’s questionable whether all these years
    in school are necessary when pursuing a career in machine learning, as a good
    certification course can often offer you all the skills you need to succeed.
