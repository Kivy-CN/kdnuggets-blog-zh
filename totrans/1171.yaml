    Business Review called 'data scientist' the sexiest job of the 21st century, and
    the growing trend of roles in the industry seems to be confirming that statement.
    To confirm this sexiness is still ongoing, the info from Glassdoor shows being
    a data scientist is the second-best job in America in 2021.

    Data science questions asked can be very broad and complex. This is expected,
    considering the role of a data scientist usually incorporates so many areas. 
    To help you prepare for the data science job interviews, I have reviewed all the
    applicable questions and separated them into different question categories. Here’s
    how I did that.

    half of all questions come from that area. It’s not surprising when you think
    about it. Coding and modelling are probably the two most important skills for
    a data scientist. Coding-type questions are widespread, comprising more than one-third
    of all questions. Other question types, such as algorithms and statistics, are
    also fairly significant; 24% of all questions come from these two categories.
    Other categories are not as represented. I find that reasonable, considering the
    nature of a data scientist role.

    data science. Such questions will require some sort of data manipulation using
    the code to identify insights. The questions are designed to test coding ability,
    problem-solving skills, and creativity. You’ll usually do that on a computer or

    you know the difference between different joins and how to use them to get the
    required result.

    other concepts that are usually asked are filtering data using the WHERE and/or

    that you know the aggregate functions, such as SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX().

    being prepared for such questions. For example, Common Table Expressions or CTEs

    estimates are constrained (or regularised) to zero. By doing this, it is possible
    to reduce the variance of the model while at the same time decreasing the sampling
    error. Regularisation is used to avoid or reduce overfitting. Overfitting happens
    when the model learns training data so well it undermines the model’s performance
    on new data. To avoid overfitting, Ridge or Lasso regularisations are usually
    used.”*'

    the probability of getting a certain card/number from a set of dice/cards. This
    seems to be the most common element of questioning for most companies in our research,
    as many of them have asked these types of questions.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**ANSWER**: *“This first card you draw can be whatever, so it does not impact
    the result other than that there is one card less left in the deck. Once the first
    card is drawn, there are three remaining cards in the deck that can be drawn to
    get a pair. So, the chance of matching your first card with a pair is 3 out of
    51 (remaining cards). This means that the probability of this event occurring
    is 3/51 or 5.89%.”*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since this is a kind of “specialised” question that deals only with probability,
    no other concepts are asked. The only difference is how imaginative the question
    is. But basically, you’ll always have to calculate the probability of some event
    and show your thinking.

    value with a key and getting the data using the same key. Tuples are the same
    as lists. The difference is that in a tuple, the data can’t be changed. Set contains

    The interview questions’ data are taken from dozens of companies over a four-year

    question types (algorithms, business case, coding, modelling, probability, product,
    statistics, system design, and technical questions).

    from each question type category. For example, the most asked statistics questions
    have to do with sampling and distribution. Every question category is supported
    by one practical example of the real question.
