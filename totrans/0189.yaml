- en: This one is a no-brainer. We’ve had ChatGPT, Google Bard and god knows what
    else has come out of the woodwork in the past month. So what is Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) and why did I mention ChatGPT and Google Bard?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NLP is the process of helping computers understand text data.  Learning a language
    is already difficult for us humans, so you can imagine how difficult it is to
    teach a computer to understand text data. NLP uses various techniques such as
    Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Summarization, Text Classification,
    Lemmatization/stemming, and more.

- en: 'ChatGPT and Google Bard are Large Language Models (LLM), deep-learning algorithms
    that can read, recognise, summarise, translate, predict, and also generate text.
    With this, they can predict future words and have a conversation with the user
    as if it was talking to a human. Learn more about LLMs here: [Learn About Large
    Language Models](/2023/03/learn-large-language-models.html).'

- en: ChatGPT and Google Bard seem to be competing with one another to see who will
    have the last laugh as the best large language model chatbot out there. This will
    mean that AI systems will become more adept at understanding and generating human
    language, requiring NLP to be at the forefront of this fight.

- en: As we see a rise in chatbots, for example, ChatGPT and Google Bard. We know
    that they will not stay limited to only being able to return text. OpenAI announced
    that ChatGPT-4 is a multimodal model that will offer completely different possibilities
    – for example, videos, images, etc.

    it coming that OpenAI was planning to make ChatGPT-4 multimodal. Learn more about
    ChatGPT-4 here: [GPT-4: Everything You Need To Know](/2023/03/gpt4-everything-need-know.html).'

    and TikTok - where your data is being recorded to improve the recommendation system.
    With that being said if you have a tool that understands you as an individual,
    your preferences, behaviour, and needs - would this essentially eliminate the
    need for human interaction?

    to say that sooner or later these AI systems and tools will be a part of our everyday
    work life. I’m not sure about you, but a lot of my colleagues are already using
    chatbots such as Google Bard to help them create job specs. Regardless if it's
    the use of large language models or computer vision - AI will start to be a core
    part of work environments and processes.

    use of AI. Due to the hype around it, and continuous investment and research going
    into it - more and more industries will adopt AI to improve these industries.

    laundering processes, and investment management. They might look into using chatbots
    to deal with an applicant's whole process, lowering their cost and tasks.

    of countries, with some dealing with unfortunately low salaries. If these roles
    were passed onto AI systems, robots, etc - would that be so bad? It’s hard to
    tell because with anything good - there has to be a bad, right? Let me know what
    you think in the comments.
