    In either case, the model’s ability to solve the problem is just a proxy to the
    model built from actual data (which is not yet available to you, unfortunately).

    the right attributes carrying a good signal. And the buck does not stop here -
    the next concern is to evaluate how much data is needed to get the first model
    version out? Well, it depends on how complex a task ML needs to solve? If the
    features are easily segregating the different classes of the target variable (assuming
    classification ML), lesser data will also do the job like in ‘[Iris toy data’](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html).

    from the statistical associations. Not only do you need to input good signal attributes
    but removing the features that add noise will also help the model to learn faster
    and better.

    the best model. In fact, what is the best model? A model with a good generalizability
    quotient on previously unseen data is what everyone adores. That defines how robust
    the model is. Running experiments is easy but finding a robust model isn’t. Create
    an evaluation dataset that best represents what your model will get to see and
    perform on when deployed in production. Run your best model on this unseen evaluation
    dataset to find if it is truly the best.
