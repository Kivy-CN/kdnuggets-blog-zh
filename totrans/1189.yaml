    tons of talented people to join the competition for a seat in top companies’ data
    science teams. There are numerous articles out there teaching you how to [prep
    for DS interviews](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-interview-prep-guide-for-data-scientists-and-data-analysts-18621db1da47) and
    “stand out from the rest of the interviewees”, but the journey certainly does
    not stop at getting hired. Getting a job offer is merely the first step; however,
    not many people talk about how you can stand out from the rest of the *hired* data
    scientists once you pass the interviews and join the company.

    data scientists across McKinsey and top companies I served and have observed what
    the common traits are among those that get the highest ratings and praises from
    partners and clients alike. And maybe surprising to some of you, the highest performing
    data scientists are not necessarily the ones that build the fanciest models or
    the ones that write the most efficient code (of course they have to clear a pretty
    high bar of technical skills to be hired) but the ones that possess a number of
    important **“soft skills”** on top of their analytical abilities. This article
    summarizes my experience and observations from my time at McKinsey into 5 lessons
    that will help you become a better data scientist.

    “data scientist” as a title covers a wide range of jobs in the industry nowadays,
    in this article I’m mostly focusing on tips for data scientists that influence
    business decisions in any shape or form (rather than those in more research-oriented
    “core data science” roles).

- en: 'Top-down communication, or the pyramid principle, was coined and popularized
    by McKinsey partner Barbara Minto and is viewed by many people as the most efficient
    communication structure when it comes to business (or even personal life). Even
    though it’s second nature to some people like strategic consultants, a lot of
    data scientists get tripped up on this communication front. The idea is simple:
    when you try to communicate an idea/argument, it’s the most efficient and the
    easiest for the audience to follow if you start with a **key message**, followed
    by several **main arguments** supporting this key message; if needed, each argument
    can be followed by **supporting data**.'

    of an email/memo or an executive summary at the beginning of a research paper,
    you will understand the importance of this. Having the key message upfront will
    make sure your audience gets a general idea even if they don’t catch all the details.'

    you can prepare one set of communication and keep it on the level of “key message”

    peers and other analytical audiences who are interested in the in-the-weeds stuff.'

    most of the time, this communication structure might not come naturally and can
    be counterintuitive. Way too frequently I watch data scientists start a presentation
    or communication with in-depth details and get the audience lost without getting
    the key message across.

    should be the key message you convey.'

    it emphasizes the importance of a role called “translator” that supposedly functions
    as the bridge of communication between business and data teams translating analytical
    insights into actionable ones for the business (I assume this role was born partially
    from the frustration of the point I made above). I’m sure as a data scientist,
    you have been asked to “explain it like you are explaining to a five-year-old”
    or “explain it in plain Eglish”. The data scientists that stand out from the rest
    are the ones who can do just that — function as their own translator; if asked,
    they can explain their ML models well to CEOs who have neither an analytics background
    nor time to read white papers, and they can always tie the results of their analyses
    back to business impacts. Those data scientists are valued for the following reasons:'
  prefs: []

- en: 'It’s hard to get “translators” from non-analytical people: McKinsey did try
    to train a group of strategic consultants to be “translators” on different analytics
    studies; but in my opinion, never succeeded. The reason is pretty simple: in order
    to accurately explain the key takeaways of complex analyses and accurately reflect
    caveats, you need an analytical mindset and deep understanding which cannot be
    achieved through a few weeks of analytics boot camp training. For example, how
    do you explain the number of clusters you chose for K-means if you don’t know
    the elbow method? How do you explain the elbow method if you don’t know what SSE
    is?. As a DS, the time you spend teaching this mostly unsuccessful crash course
    is probably better spent crafting your own communication style and coming up with
    the translation yourself.'

    most people have played the “telephone” game or a variation of it. The longer
    the information is being passed around, the harder it is to keep its precision.
    Now imagine the same process happening to your analytics work; if you rely on
    others to explain/translate your work, the message might diverge quite a bit from
    reality when it gets to the end-user.'

    of a company. It’s of course super valuable to be able to identify problems and
    raise concerns, but what’s even more appreciated is the ability to propose potential
    solutions. Without a solution-driven person in the room, discussions can often
    go in circles, obsession over problems rather than trying to figure out a path
    forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At most top consulting firms, being solution-driven is the № 1 rule and in my
    opinion, this approach should be transferred to the tech world as well. As a data
    scientist, you might frequently go through frustrating situations when people
    make ridiculous data asks due to their lack of analytical background. I have seen
    countless DS not knowing how to handle those situations and fail at stakeholder
    management for being the constant naysayer. Instead of shutting them down, be
    solution-driven and help them redefine the ask and limit the scope with your better
    understanding of the data and analytical tools.

    of being the one proposing a new solution. It’s also helpful to branch out fromyour
    workstream and learn more about the business and other teams’ work. Getting the

    hard to take a step back to ask yourself why we wanted to predict churn in the
    first place. Companies want to predict churn so they can find an actionable solution
    to prevent it. So if your model tells the CEO “**the cubic root of #of web visits **is
    one of the most important features indicating churn”, what can he do with that
    information? Probably nothing…'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a data scientist, like many of you, I used to solely focus on accuracy as *the* success
    metric when it comes to modeling. But I gradually came to the realization that
    increasing the accuracy from 96% to 98% by adding unexplainable features and fine-tuning
    hyperparameters means nothing to the business if you can’t tie it to business
    impacts (again, this only applies to business-facing DS, for certain areas of
    ML, this increase probably means the world).

    is a black box. A model is a tool to guide business decisions at the end of the

    and interpretability.

    models or carrying out analyses. When building models, avoid throwing random interactive
    features at the model and hope one of them will stick; instead be very thoughtful
    about the feature engineering stage before even starting to build the model. Writing
    down the business suggestions coming out of the model/analysis will also help
    you re-evaluate the design choices you made when building the model.'

    feature exploration to exploratory data analyses (EDA). Without hypotheses, you
    will have no direction for how to slice and dice the data for EDA or which features
    to test first. Without hypotheses, there’s even no point to carry out AB testing
    (that’s why it’s called hypothesis testing). But every so often, I observe data
    scientists who delve into the head-down analysis stage without a clear hypothesis
    and later get lost in a rabbit hole. Or even more often, data scientists leave
    the hypothesis structuring process completely to team members with no visibility
    into data and later realize there’s not enough data to test those hypotheses.
    The best approach in my opinion is for data scientists to be engaged in those
    hypothesis brainstorm sessions from the beginning and use hypotheses to guide
    and prioritize subsequent analyses.
  prefs: []

- en: As important as hypotheses are, they should serve as the starting point, not
    the endpoint. Time and time again I have seen a lot of data scientists (or people
    who work with data scientists) stick with a hypothesis despite contradictory findings.
    This “loyalty” to the initial hypotheses would lead to data snooping and massaging
    data to fit a certain narrative. If you are familiar with “[Simpson’s paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox#:~:text=Simpson's%20paradox%2C%20which%20also%20goes,when%20these%20groups%20are%20combined.)”,
    you can understand the power of data in telling the “wrong story”.Good data scientists
    should be able to keep data integrity and pivot the narrative to fit the data
    instead of the other way around.

    and acumen in order to come up with good hypotheses. Keep the hypotheses on your
    mind to guide you during data exploration, but be open-minded to admit when the
    data is telling you a different story from your initial “educated guess”. Having
    a good business sense will also help you tweak your initial theory along the way
    and tweak your narrative according to the data.'

    understand the strategic/business side of things and understand how to communicate
