    responsibilities agnostic to technical function and optimized for learning. Thus,
    his team hires and grows generalists who can conceptualize, model, implement,
    and measure. Of course, this is dependent on a solid data platform that abstracts
    away the complexities of infra setup, distributed processing, monitoring, automated
    failover, etc.

    created inefficiencies across the product life cycle. Code releases took more
    time (weeks instead of days), deployment problems took longer to detect and resolve,
    and production issues required multiple back-and-forth communications.'

    simplify common development processes (e.g., build and deploy pipelines, monitoring,
    managed rollbacks). Such tooling is reusable across multiple teams, acts as a
    force multiplier, and helped devs be effective across the entire cycle.

    the entire pipeline took a very long time. I thought we could halve the time by
    moving the data prep and feature engineering pipelines into the database. But,
    the database guy didn’t have time to test this. Being impatient, I ran some benchmarks
    and reduced overall run time by 90%. This allowed us to experiment 10x faster
    and save on compute costs in production.

    (due to the large data volume). However, our cluster only supported the Scala API,
    which I was unfamiliar with. Not wanting to wait (for data engineering support),
    I chose the faster—but painful—route of figuring out Scala Spark and writing the
    pipelines myself. This likely halved dev time and gave me a better understanding
    of the data to build a better model.

    the model. As a result, they were manually picking top products to display, decreasing
    online metrics (e.g., CTR, conversion). To understand more, I made trips to our
    marketplaces (e.g., Indonesia, Vietnam). Through mutual education, we were able
    to address their concerns and reduce the amount of manual overwriting and reap
    the gains.
