    it seems that only advanced techniques will solve all your problems when you want
    to build a predictive model. But, as you get your hands dirty in the code, you
    find out that the truth is very, very different. A lot of the problems you will
    face as a data scientist are solved with a combination of several models and most
    of them have been around for ages.

    problems, with minimum differences between the two — the rationale behind choosing

    trees, you can configure a ton of hyper-parameters to enhance the performance
    of this Bagging model. **What’s Bagging?** A really important concept in ML that

    averages the results from all those previous models — and just like Decision Trees,
    we have Classification and Regression Random Forests. If you’ve heard about the
