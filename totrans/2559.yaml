- en: No-code or low-code platforms have gained a lot of traction in recent years
    as those with limited programming and development experience become interested
    in related technologies. These platforms allow the inexperienced to do things
    like build mobile apps, deploy web applications on websites and within work environments,
    or even leverage AI and machine learning.

- en: Where traditionally one would need a strong background in various development
    and programming disciplines to really take advantage of ML, that’s no longer the
    case. Of course, deployments can be much more sophisticated for those who do have
    the proper background, but TinyML and no-code ML solutions are making these technologies
    more accessible to everyone.

    where the goal isn’t just to “democratize AI,” but also to greatly expand its
    capabilities in a business setting. No-code ML or autoML are not as popular as
    their AI brethren, and it’s definitely an emerging field. TinyML, although slightly
    different, offers the same benefits because the logic is embedded within the device
    itself.

- en: These technologies, even in low-code form, require constant and massive streams
    of data, and they also ingest and process that data in real-time. AI and ML solutions
    can process information exponentially faster than the human mind. As such, they
    already improve efficiency and output. But they’re also limited by today’s networks,
    which can experience bandwidth and service interruptions, bottlenecks, and any
    number of delays or complications.

- en: It stands to reason that unlocking these technologies by providing the active
    connections they require can enhance the performance benefits even more. That
    is precisely where edge computing comes into the picture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Edge computing involves taking the computation and processing solutions and
    moving them closer to the source, or incredibly close to where that processing
    needs to happen. It bridges the gap between complex computations that are carried
    out on the actual device versus those carried out remotely on an external server
    or system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Handling events locally means equipping the device(s) with enough power to do
    the work, which is not always possible, convenient, or cost-effective. Comparatively,
    handling it remotely affords much more power but often at the cost of speed and
    performance. Edge computing solutions offer the best of both worlds, with improvements
    to scalability, reliability, and customization.
  prefs: []

- en: It’s also possible to optimize where that “edge” truly is, to reduce latency,
    lower operating and service costs, increase visibility, accelerate deployments,
    and more. One IoT startup was able to utilize the AWS Compute Optimizer, with
    the assistance of a consultant, to implement a compute savings plan — reducing
    its overall bill [by 37.5% per month](https://www.trek10.com/blog/10-lessons-learned-from-start-ups-on-their-aws-journey).
    It highlights the potential flexibility and dynamic nature of cloud and edge computing
    solutions.

- en: Again, no-code ML aims to democratize and improve accessibility for the related
    technologies. That means more and more people will have access to machine learning,
    AI, and neural network solutions, and both dependability and reliability will
    grow that much more imperative.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is that most people opting to develop with no-code or low-code solutions
    generally do not have the power or infrastructure in place to support machine
    learning platforms on a macro level. Imagine a small startup launches a mobile
    app, and that app uses machine learning to analyze a user’s movie and TV preferences
    to provide recommendations. Neat idea, right? Solutions like this are [already
    being explored](https://rehack.com/data/machine-learning/6-benefits-of-machine-learning-for-the-entertainment-industry/)
    and are already in use.

    to hundreds of thousands or even millions of different users and accounts, it’s
    going to take a ton of computational power to support the platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At some point, the developers will need to scale up their infrastructure to
    handle larger quantities of work, without affecting performance and reliability.
    Edge computing solutions are a more manageable way to do that, from a cost and
    performance perspective. They’re also much more accessible, which is one of the
    major benefits of cloud technologies as a whole.

    Pushing the no-code platforms themselves to the edge of the network comes with
    the same benefits in efficiency, performance, and cost.

- en: When you’re working with a development platform, such as an IDE, you want near-instant
    feedback. If the web applications are taking full advantage of edge processing,
    that improves the entire experience and also makes quick feedback possible.

    or internet-enabled hardware. Everything happens locally, on the device or a microcontroller.
    It has become the go-to practice for the industrial internet of things (IIoT),
    where embedded computing offers unparalleled performance and speed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to understand that edge computing and cloud computing are not
    interchangeable and are not meant to replace one another. They are for distinct
    purposes. Edge computing is often the solution of choice for time-sensitive data
    processing and delivery, whereas cloud computing is for data that has no time
    constraints.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Edge computing is best for localized situations, where open connections may
    be spotty and the bulk of processing power must be done fast and close to the
    device(s) or system. It’s also an excellent solution when the technology hinges
    on speed and reliability, like [with medical and health care devices](https://www.therobotreport.com/why-and-how-to-run-machine-learning-algorithms-on-edge-devices/).
    For all other scenarios, cloud computing likely applies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, pushing no-code ML platforms and computational efforts to the edge does
    not technically mean pushing them into the cloud. There are similarities, but
    they are not the same.

- en: Edge computing is a viable and beneficial form of data processing that is extremely
    relevant to more traditional machine learning applications as well as no-code
    or low-code ML deployments. It moves the power closer to the end-user, or the
    output of the system, to improve performance and reliability and offer a much
    more scalable solution that can handle the requirements of an ML-driven application.
