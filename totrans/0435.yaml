    The person who has specific physical attributes that are going to impress clients

    ‘nerdy’. An industry for men, smart men; pushing women further and further away
    from the career. It is known that most of the people who collect, analyse, produce
    outputs and make decisions are men. In 2019, According to [TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-only-18-of-data-scientists-are-women/),
    women make up 18% of Data Science jobs in the United States. The figures decrease
    even further in lower-income countries where women are less likely to have access
    to better education and degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
    (STEM); which all provide a pathway to Data Science.

    in 2019, 83.02% of women were literate compared to 89.93 percent of men. As a
    result, women often struggle to engage with digital technologies effectively.
    We are already aware that there is a gender imbalance in STEM careers, disheartening
    women from entering the industry. The level of training provided to women in careers
    such as Data Science is also less, making it harder for women to succeed in building
    their careers and landing high-paying professions, pushing more emphasis on the
    gender pay gap.

    of the STEM workforce and just 9% of STEM executive leadership

- en: We are all aware that hiring algorithms have probably been the reason why some
    of us haven’t been selected for the next stage. It makes matters worst for women
    as they are less likely to apply for specific job roles such as Data Science,
    especially high-tech companies that use hiring algorithms. According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G),
    Amazon used a machine learning algorithm as their new recruiting process, which
    did not favor women. The company had used previously submitted resumes from the
    previous decade as their training data for the algorithm. Considering the majority
    of these resumes came from men, the program learned that male candidates were
    preferable, penalising women. The program taught itself to deter from the word
    “women’, for example, “women’s chess club captain”. Although Amazon had picked
    up on this in the early stages, this iterates that it is not a problem of humans
    relying on models too much. It is more of an issue of how biased data can be used
    to make incorrect decisions, enforcing inequality in the workforce.

    decisions, it becomes an important element in our lives. However, what if the
    data we have does not benefit women? Or give us a clear understanding of women?
    Could AI technology help or hinder women in the existing gender gap in the majority
    of industries?

    will also be the reason why many people will lose their jobs in numerous sectors
    as it can replace their role. This further puts women in the worst of positions,
    as there is little data to support them during this revolution. BCG says, “AI
    applications can perpetuate and exacerbate gender bias, further widening the gap
    in the leadership pipeline. If an AI application is trained on data that is biased,
    the algorithms it develops will likely be biased, too”.

    As the numbers of women in these industries increase, it helps to ensure that
    women are not penalised due to predetermined algorithms, giving the younger generation
    a better chance and more hope to develop in STEM careers.
