    business. Several companies are now allowing employees to work remotely. Whether
    you are a seasoned data scientist or a data science aspirant still trying to get
    into the field, there are essential soft skills for remote work that you have
    to develop in addition to your hardcore technical skills. Strengthening your communication
    skills (including writing, speaking, and active listening) is extremely important.

- en: The ability to articulate your ideas during a virtual meeting is a great skill
    that will make you stand out. Generally, industrial data science projects are
    very broad in scope and complexity, and also very multidisciplinary in nature,
    involving individuals with expertise in different areas. Strong speaking skills
    will enable you to convey your ideas clearly to members in your team. Without
    being able to articulate clearly, you won’t be able to function well as a team
    player. If you are a data science aspirant still looking into getting into the
    field of data science, then good speaking skills will help you to express your
    ideas clearly during the zoom interview process. Your ability to demonstrate both
    technical acumen and communication savviness will likely give you an advantage
    over candidates who can’t articulate their ideas clearly.

    completed a project. Now is the time to prepare a project report. Good writing
    skills will help you to present the findings from your project in a clear and
    concise manner. You want to use this opportunity to make a strong case that the
    findings from your project are important and if implemented, could improve the
    way business is being conducted. You want to convince executives and managers
    how you arrived at your solution in a way that is not too technical. With remote
    work, email use has skyrocketed. Good writing skills are helpful when you compose
    emails to send to business executives or other members of your team. You want
    to make sure to write high-quality emails that are professional and error-free.
    As a data science aspirant, writing skills will enable you to compose a great
    follow-up email after the interview process.

    carefully during virtual zoom meetings with members of your team is very essential.
    If possible, take down detailed notes of key points discussed during business
    meetings. Even if you are the lead data scientist, you don’t want to dominate
    the meeting with talking. You have to listen carefully to your team members as
    they often contribute valuable ideas on how to tackle and solve problems. As a
    data science aspirant, you have to listen carefully during the interview process
    to make sure you understand all the details about the company and what your role
    would be. This would enable you to determine if the company is a good fit.

    in your organization. As a lifelong learner, good reading skills will also help
    you to stay current with new developments in the field. Some blogging platforms
    that can help you stay current include Medium, LinkedIn, GitHub, KDnuggets, and
    Kaggle.

- en: Presenting a professional appearance is important not only during the job-seeking
    and interview process — it’s something that should be carried over into your everyday
    life as a career professional. The way you dress is a reflection of how you view
    your work and how others see you and your company. Good business attire will ensure
    that you always project the appropriate image. It is not a good idea to attend
    important business meetings in casual attire such as pajamas. Also, if attending
    a zoom meeting, make sure you are in an area that is quiet with limited distractions.
    How does your zoom background look like? Using a background that ensures you are
    not a distraction to others is certainly helpful.

    work. Make sure you are putting the right amount of time each day. Find a workplace
    that is free from distractions.
