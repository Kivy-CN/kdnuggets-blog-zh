    bias-variance trade-offs, the power of generalization, assumptions of algorithms,
    and much more. This list by no means is complete (or, will ever be), as the data
    science field involves continuous learning – that mostly happens through practical
    hands-on applications, or from learning how industry experts are doing it.

    of the Generative-AI era, which has prompted many organizations to reduce their
    workforce. Even Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang shared his views on future workforce
    and skills by highlighting that “AI will take over coding, making learning optional.
    AI is set to make coding accessible for everyone, reshaping how we learn to program”

    things. Think of every problem statement as a gateway to learning something new
    in AI. It is similar to studying in university, albeit the one where you are paid
    for learning to make innovations come to life, instead of paying fees. Data science
    involves “science”, which is experimentative and involves multiple iterations
    to give meaningful results (and sometimes no success at all, just the learnings).
    These learnings accumulate over time and help you build a knowledge bank, which
    becomes your differentiator as you gain experience.
