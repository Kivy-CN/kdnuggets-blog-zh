    do to start being able to actually build Machine Learning projects and solutions?”*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is so much information out there — both good and bad — that it can be
    hard to know where to begin. Also, people come from very different backgrounds,
    so the starting point can vary significantly. For example, for me, I entered the
    ML world by watching theoretical videos from Computer Science channels about neural
    networks, and as I got more and more interested I started reading articles, news,
    and blogs about the topic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, by doing this I only developed a vague understanding of the most superficial
    part of Machine Learning, and I was nowhere near being able to tackle a project
    by myself. Knowing this I decided to take some affordable [Udemy Machine Learning
    courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).
    Courses like these were helpful, as they rounded and improved my knowledge a little
    bit, and also covered some Python implementations of different algorithms and
    models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Still, the courses did not leave me content with what a knew, and I wanted to
    go deeper, understand every conversation, know the guts of the algorithms, and
    develop and understanding of how to build an End-to-End Machine Learning project
    by myself. I wanted to be able to have and idea, build or download a data-set,
    and execute it.

    It is a book that was originally published in 2017 and that still, in my opinion
    which each new revision has become an even better version of one of the best in-depth

- en: This book is thought for beginners in Machine Learning, that are looking for
    a practical approach to learning by building projects and studying the different
    Machine Learning algorithms within a specific context. After completing the whole
    book you should be ready to face a project by yourself and be confortable with
    the different steps in this process.

    maths, algebra and statistics knowledge. Apart from this, you can finish it easily
    with very little or no initial understanding or Machine Learning if you are willing
    to make an effort.

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every person is different, but for me what worked best was to read the book
    on paper while writing notes on the side. Simultaneously I would try to go through
    the code, and every time at the end of the chapter I would take my time to answer
    the questions and do the mini — exercises. If I got stuck or I didn’t know how
    to do something I re-read some parts of the chapter or looked for information
    on-line.

- en: If you’ve just started studying Machine Learning, this book will take the theoretical
    knowledge you have, considerably improve it, and then put it to use in some real
    projects. Many times we are not able to test how much we know about something
    until we try to put it in practice. By reading this book you will be completely
    ready to work in projects of your interest.

    this book will round up your theoretical knowledge, teach you some practical tricks
    that you probably ignore, and advise you on how to structure your projects in
    an optimal manner. It is a wonderful book to have near-by to answer specific questions
    that might arise in your day to day work.

    of projects you would like to do with Machine Learning and with the book by your
    side, try to execute them. This will test you on real world problems, make you
    face some of the difficulties of Machine Learning projects, and also you will
    be building a portfolio of solved problems that will be of high value in your
    learning and in your future as a Machine Learning engineer or Data Scientist.
