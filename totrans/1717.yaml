- en: This is the step where we have to select the “right algorithm” to get the “right
    set of solutions” for our business problem. This, as you can see, is an extremely
    important step and key is to find the most suitable algorithm for the given business
    objective. In the case above, without going into a lot of details, we have two
    sets of objectives – (1) finding the most responsive set of customers out of 100MM
    – lets say that’s x (2) for each customer out of this list of x customers, show
    offers that are most relevant to him/her preferences. For the first objective,
    we need a response prediction algorithm (e.g. regression techniques) that will
    give a response likelihood score/probability for each customer, which then can
    be used to rank-order the customers and select the most responsive ones for the
    campaign. For objective (2) – finding customer’s offer preferences, we need algorithms
    that can help select the product offers that are most likely to be preferred by
    a customer (e.g. recommender algorithms or classification techniques)

- en: Now, in the above table, you can see that there are discrepancies between the
    values of “average probability of response” and “actual response rate” for some
    of the buckets, for e.g., buckets 3 and 4\. So, the predictions are not very “accurate”
    when compared to the actual values. However, since the objective here is to select
    a set of high response likelihood customers, we are more concerned about how well
    the model is rank-ordering the customers in terms of response. Looking at the
    actual rates, it seems to be doing a pretty good job (the actual response rates
    from past campaigns is also pretty much ordered in a descending order).
  id: totrans-38

    the customers by their response probability rather than the accuracy of the predictions.

    10 product offers:'

    For products 3 and 5, since the preference score is very low, we can assume that
    he doesn’t have any preference for these products. Similarly, we can say that
    customer 2 is not showing preference for any particular product. We can create
    a threshold score where if a customer’s score is higher than that threshold, then
    we will consider the preference, otherwise not.
  id: totrans-45

    of the score and therefore, it is important that we have accurate scores that
    reflect the true preferences of the customer. Hence, in this model evaluation,
    prediction accuracy is very important.
