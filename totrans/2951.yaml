- en: In the real world, data is rarely as simple as rows and columns. Instead the
    pattern of data is more like a web, with numerous links, connections, and relationships
    between different data points. As machine learning engineers, how can we model
    this complex interconnectivity to improve our machine learning applications? This
    is where graph-based machine learning shines.

- en: Graph-based machine learning is an incredibly powerful tool for any task that
    involves pattern matching in large data sets. By organizing and analyzing your
    data as graphs, your applications work more fluidly to spot connections and identify
    relationships. This can be the trick you need to seriously upgrade the performance
    of common machine learning tasks like search results optimisation, recommendation
    engines, or social networking.
