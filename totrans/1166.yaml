    from home became a norm, something which was looked down upon when women used
    to seek this 'LUXURY' in pre-covid times.

    online webinars. Specifically, in the context of women conferences, I often used
    to wonder why is there a need to call out women and organize separate events for
    them.

    in "general conferences" not speak for itself? What stops women from demonstrating
    their work or giving voice to their beliefs in front of a wider audience?

    are talking business" while women are presumably amateurish and inept when they
    do the same. Women-focused conferences relieve them of this impression and give
    them the voice and freedom to share a wide range of topics e.g. how to maintain
    work-life balance, managing kids during the pandemic, receiving support from colleagues,
    a new business idea, or collaboration on the current project.'

    that demands disruptive technical skills, often synonymously dominated by men,
    the talks also involve such skills that a lot of women are yet to pick up, making
    it a tough bet for their time (filled with family responsibilities).'

    the point that mother nature has distinguished it to. And it should just stop
    there. Anything afterward is purely based on merit, dedication, and hard work.
    Why is it important to bring together women in one conference and teach them how
    to open up and ask for help, being assertive and confident?'

    about what they already know? Why can''t we behave agnostic to the gender? No
    one can teach the whole society and pivot the deep-rooted biased lens we have
    been seeing the world with. It calls for a bottom-up approach where every individual
    feels the responsibility to promote and support equality in fighting the prejudices
    prevalent in the society'

    work in Data Science. I found one thing consistent across these networks - leaders
    from the industry share their stories and tips to deal with difficult situations.
    Some of the advice that resonates with me:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Being a yes (wo)man:** Boundaries are just something that exists in our minds.
    Once you are past these self-imposed boundaries, the world of opportunities will
    open up for you. This fearless attitude of being a ''Yes woman'' has done wonders
    to me on both fronts, personally and professionally. I became more confident of
    doing my best to whatever came my way.'

- en: '**Network your way through:** Make an ecosystem of women in data, connecting
    with like-minded people gives you a perspective of how to handle similar situations.
    It also helps you make wiser decisions without committing the same mistakes that
    others have done.'
  prefs: []

- en: '**Share the same vocabulary:** Understand the business requirements, concerns
    of the stakeholders, map it to how you can contribute, and voice it out. I believe
    that the organizations are appreciative of their associates that add value and
    do not let their gender, caste, or religion come in the way of retaining successful
    business contributors.'

- en: '**Stop fighting the unconscious:** It is important to acknowledge that there
    might be a subtle bias present in the subconscious of people around you. But we
    have to stop letting it come in the way of our vision. I am a working mother and
    know for sure the value of each hour that slips out of my hand. I would rather
    prefer to spend my time productively by upskilling myself. People can take anything
    but your knowledge away from you. Keep working on your knowledge bank and it will
    pave the right path for you in the long run.'

- en: '**Ways to be productive:** Women are good at multi-tasking (and we know that :)).
    So, it is important that we use it to our advantage. Listening to podcasts, or
    technical courses while cooking or taking nature''s walk keeps me on my toes and
    lets me utilize my time judiciously. Another important aspect of networking comes
    from the right use of social media, I try to connect with the leaders in Data
    Science to keep myself adept with the latest technologies and algorithms.'

- en: '**No golden rule:** In the end, I would say that there is no recipe for success.
    Working on the "try fast, fail fast" formula proves to be good sometimes. So,
    do not be a victim of self-doubt and give a shot at everything that you dream
    of. When anyone tries to get you down, do not let it affect you. ''Show-up to
    the adversities in the face''.'
