    on May 20th, we decided to host a series of talks on the subject of Ethics in
    Machine Learning. As we mentioned in a [KD Nuggets post](/2016/03/ethics-machine-learning-tay-chatbot-fiasco.html)
    last month, we’ve recently asked ourselves this: Can AI really ever be safe if
    it learns from us? Following our Quora question: “[What constraints to AI and
    machine learning algorithms are needed to prevent AI from becoming a dystopian
    threat to humanity?](https://www.quora.com/What-constraints-to-AI-and-machine-learning-algorithms-are-needed-to-prevent-AI-from-becoming-a-dystopian-threat-to-humanity)“
    The winner of the contest, Igor Markov, went on to present his answer and plan
    at MLconf Seattle on 05/20.'

    is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars.” Markov went on to explore several
    science fiction films, and how the machines rose to power, societal fears around
    this happening in reality, and then reminded us of how humanity survived in past
    eras and how we can use this knowledge in a time of “the rise of the machines”.
    In his plan, Markov suggested that when designing an AI system, you want to introduce
    and keep boundaries between different levels of intelligence & trust. His key
    points were that:'

    In a pre-event interview, Estola participated in the conversation about ethics
    in ML.. His response: “Because the easiest way to build machine learning skills
    is practicing on canned data sets, it’s easy to run into problems with real data.
    It turns out that wild data are messy, incomplete, and sometimes even racist,
    sexist, and immoral. We need to acknowledge that the real world can be garbage
    at times, and consequently we should be building systems that combat this, instead
    of succumbing to it. It won’t be easy, and it will likely cost us some points
    on our traditional performance metrics, but machine learning as we know it can
    really only infer the status quo, and we need to be better than that. We all know
    racist computers are a bad idea. Don’t let your company build racist computers.”
    In his talk, Estola urged us to spread awareness about the issue and urged to
    use solutions such as using simple solutions, even if they have a small concession
    in performance. He also suggested using ensemble modeling and designing test data
    sets for capturing unintended bias.'

    & consequences in data-driven applications and how such errors have the ability
    to offend the masses. Tramèr went on to explain preventative measures, but also
    their limitations. His solution? FairTest, which finds context specific associations
    between protected variables and application outputs. FairTest can be used to understand
    and evaluate potential association bugs.

- en: The conversation of ethics in machine learning is far from over. We’re hoping
    that by providing a platform for these ideas to be expressed, we can keep the
    momentum going on thwarting off any potential threat to society from the machines
    we build. Thankfully, the community does not deal with this potential problem
    on a conceptual and philosophical level. There is an increase in research activity
    seeking solutions to these potential threats. We aim to shed light on this work,
    as we see the value.

    who should not go unacknowledged, who presented on a variety of topics such as
    the future of ML, NLP, Probabilistic Programming, Multi-Algorithm Ensembles, Neuroscience
    as it relates to Deep Learning, Recommender Systems, and more! We’ll be covering
    these and additional topics in machine learning in our series of events this [fall](http://www.eventbrite.com/o/mlconf-the-machine-learning-conference-38144153).
    Mention “Ethics18” and save 18% on [any](http://www.eventbrite.com/o/mlconf-the-machine-learning-conference-38144153)
    of our upcoming events this fall!
