    worked with DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Brain, and many more. The world of ML and
    AI is growing so quickly, to keep up with all of the changes is difficult for
    professionals and aspiring professionals. The goal at TheSequence is to make people
    who are interested in the sector smarter about AI without having to read white
    papers and spend hours on end researching.'

    by data scientists. This sparked from TheSequence's wanting to create a new landscape
    that would be able to address the entire ML value chain, a project that was comprehensive
    but very valuable.

- en: “*We all thought the ML field had its problems, but we didn’t quite realize
    how disjointed it was. It seems that many ML practitioners either struggle or
    don’t reach their goals at all. And not because of poor code or even noisy data.
    But due to software incompatibility and poor strategizing within the chain that
    usually starts to assume form right from the get-go*.”

    tells us that unfortunately there is not one market solution that covers all six
    stages of the chain.
  prefs: []

    Vertex AI, Scale AI, Toloka AI, and Abacus.AI.

- en: This normally starts in the early stages of production and the challenges continue
    throughout till post-deployment. Important aspects of the success of an ML project
    also lie within the collection of data and the effectiveness of data labeling.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the root challenges is poor optimization in the development phase which
    highly reflects in the later stages. Due to this, the monitoring of a model is
    a stage in the value chain landscape that is highly avoided.

- en: Data processing is never a simple task and is a very fragmented field, and it
    comes with its challenges. Many are eager to find a process that is easy to use,
    configure and scale; however, this has not been found yet.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With anything you do, it’s nice when one thing is efficient to be used for the
    next stage and then the next stage. However, if there is no interaction or compatibility
    between the different stages - it results in a low ML project completion rate.
    There are a lot of software tools out there that are unfortunately incompatible
    and the more technical solutions get, the harder it is for professionals from
    different backgrounds to collaborate effectively.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As seen in the image above, none of the vendors were able to cover the entire
    value chain, though some were very close. However, there is currently no flexible
    universal environment available that meets the demands of the spectrum of ML at
    every single stage.
