- en: STEM education is a priority for students and educators across the country.
    Science, technology, education and math are essential fields that need skilled
    workers now and in the future. STEM is even more important for student success
    as tech advances and the world gets more complicated.

    of the world, and education is no exception. People face [many potential challenges
    as AI becomes more ubiquitous](/2023/03/downsides-ai-advancement.html), but the
    educational benefits are undeniable.

    to improve science and technology learning [for students of all ages](/2019/05/ai-machine-learning-kids.html),
    from daily instruction to experiences that reach beyond the classroom.

- en: Everyone learns at a different pace, and students have various learning styles.
    For example, visual learners won’t respond to the same methods as reading/writing
    learners. That means not everyone is on the same page, and some might get left
    behind.

- en: AI enables educators to embrace adaptive learning — a learning experience customized
    for every student. Artificial intelligence programs can gather and analyze data
    from each student to create a personalized curriculum. Kids can move at their
    own pace, getting extra long division practice or physics problems to solve if
    needed.

- en: Personalized tutoring impacts student success rates — tutored children outperform
    their untutored peers in most subjects, including STEM fields. AI tutoring takes
    things to the next level — no more one-size-fits-all learning that holds some
    kids back and leaves others behind.

    thinking and problem-solving. Traditional learning programs are rigid and leave
    little room for students to explore and experiment with new ideas.

    STEM students that enter the workforce will face bigger challenges that require
    smart solutions. Getting [experience with creative problem-solving](https://schola.com/blog/exploring-stem-could-your-daughter-be-a-future-engineer)
    early on will improve their success in future endeavors.

    virtual reality (VR) makes STEM education and other types of learning more available
    for nontraditional students. Children who may be unable to attend classes in person
    or have a learning disability can take part in learning programs thanks to AI.

    assessments may make mistakes that can impact a student’s education. However,
    [AI programs have high rates of accuracy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X22000303)

    feedback. Immediate, meaningful comments from AI and human instructors help students
    get back on the right track. Greater accuracy also allows teachers to pinpoint
    students or academic areas needing extra attention.

    gap](/2022/11/ai-education-gap-close.html) — the demand for highly intelligent
    software is high, but the number of capable workers is struggling to keep up.
    That means it’s more important than ever for students to prepare for an AI-oriented
    career in STEM.
