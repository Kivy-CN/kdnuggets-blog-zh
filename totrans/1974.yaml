    Processing (OLAP) database management system. The database system is designed

    (table join, data aggregation, etc.) and when our workflow usually involves significant
    changes in the table. On the other hand, DuckDB isn’t suitable for high-volume
    data activity and multiple concurrent processes in one database.
