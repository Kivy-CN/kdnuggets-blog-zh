  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to perform a task in
    an environment by taking an action and maximizing the cumulative rewards.

    ad impressions in real-time, self-driving cars, industrial automation including
    cooling of data-centers, stock price prediction, etc. You can read more about
    its real-world applications [here](https://neptune.ai/blog/reinforcement-learning-applications).
