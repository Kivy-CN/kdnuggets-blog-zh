- en: Model deployment is the process of trained models being integrated into practical
    applications. This includes defining the necessary environment, specifying how
    input data is introduced into the model and the output produced, and the capacity
    to analyze new data and provide relevant predictions or categorizations. Let us
    explore the process of deploying models in production.

    rows/columns. Ensure that categorical variables are also transformed from qualitative
    data to quantitative data by One-Hot Encoding or by Label Encoding. Normalize
    and standardize numerical features to transform them to a common scale.

- en: Serialize the code into a more suitable format that can be stored or distributed
    to the other system. Pickle is one of the conventional formats followed by joblib
    and ONNX formats based on the user’s requirements. After you have defined and
    optimized your model, store it in a file or database. Platforms such as Git also
    come in handy to handle the alterations and modifications to be made. Apply specific
    measures like encryption of data both while stored and in transit so that the
    data is not easily accessible to anyone else.

    to use cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Modify the necessary components
    needed for hosting of the model such as servers, databases and all that can be
    done on the right cloud infrastructure services of the selected cloud platform.

    Design a list of steps to be executed in order to make the deploymnt process more
    efficient and use a Jenkinsfile or YAML configuration in the context of GitHub
    Actions.

    fulfilled. After that, the forecasted amounts are compared with the outcomes this
    model is supposed to provide. Check the model’s generalization capability to ascertain
    whether it will perform well on other new data. To compare with the sample data,
    choose the right evaluation criteria – accuracy, precision, recall.
