- en: There is a hype train going on about ML (Machine Learning), and many beginners
    are getting to be the victims of this hype train as they are getting in for the
    wrong reasons. Your professor will explain how getting a Ph.D. is necessary if
    you want to get better or your peers are telling you how to get a better GPU and
    IDE (Integrated Development Environment). When you started to learn from the online
    courses, you realized you needed a bigger dataset and proficiency in Python. After
    learning the required skills when you applied for a job, you realized that you
    need more than a few courses or certifications to make it. In the end, after getting
    the job, you realized that it is demanding work, and sometimes these jobs don’t
    pay well at the initial stages.

    to face these problems. We will be learning a lot about the real-life problem
    faced by a beginner getting into the machine learning field.

- en: Yes, coding is necessary if you are getting into the ML field, especially deep
    learning. That doesn’t mean you spend your time learning Python, C++, or R first
    and then start learning ML. The coding part will come naturally when you are learning
    the basics. You don’t need to remember syntax or model architecture, and you can
    search them from a simple google search. It's that simple. The world is moving
    towards no-code machine learning and [AutoML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml).
    The AutoML is the power tool that will perform all the tasks for you and provide
    you with a working machine learning model. Sometimes you just need to write two
    lines of code instead of two hundred lines of code to get similar results.

    of deep learning. If you are going to train your model and deploy them for production,
    then you might need to learn MLOps rather than mathematics.

    These can be taught in an 8-hour course, and sometimes you don’t even need to
    learn all the model’s architecture available to solve a problem. I am a huge fan
    of Jeremy, and in his book [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527), he
    explains that there is a lot of gatekeeping in the field of deep learning. The
    academics will ask you to learn advanced calculus, learn all the mathematical
    models, and eventually get a Ph.D. in a specific field to make it. But you don’t
    need any of that. I have seen many people who have no degree and have business
    background are now experts in the fields. So, please focus on fundamentals, learn
    the entire course, and start growing by working on portfolio projects.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, but in a few cases. The modern deep learning models are now able to produce
    high accuracy with a limited number of samples. Even getting datasets has now
    become easier with the introduction of a platform like Kaggle, which have thousands
    of open-source datasets available to download and use for commercial purpose.
    We can also find datasets on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets), [DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com/explore/datasets), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets), [Knoema](https://knoema.com/atlas/sources),
    and [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) to train
    our model and eventually use it for production.

- en: Some jobs do require a degree in machine learning or a certificate in TensorFlow,
    but if you have a strong portfolio on GitHub and Kaggle, these things become secondary.
    A lot of developers are transitioning towards machine learning, and they don’t
    have a specialized degree or certificate to show, but they do have experience
    working with deep learning models and deploying them to production. If you can
    somehow prove to the employers that you can do every task in the machine learning
    life cycle, then you are the perfect candidate. Overall, getting a certificate
    or degree should not be in your mind if you have a strong machine learning portfolio.

    TPU with the help of the Kaggle platform. The world is moving from personal computers
    to cloud computers. You can get free CPU, GPU, and TPU from Kaggle and [Google
    Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). There are other platforms that can
    also help you with data analytics and creating complete projects, such as [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/), [JetBrains
    Datalore](https://datalore.jetbrains.com/notebooks), and [Paperspace](https://console.paperspace.com/).
    These platforms provide you with a free workspace to build your machine learning
    product with the addition of collaboration tools. In my day-to-day work, I use
    Deepnote for working on new research or projects, and if I need a better GPU or
    TPU, I switch to Kaggle or Colab.

    a diverse set of skills. The only way you can improve your chance is to keep learning
    a new skill and keep participating in machine learning competitions. This will
    also improve your ML portfolio and eventually make you stand out. It’s hard to

    You might not get a high-paying job, but you will eventually get a job that requires
    your full-time and focus. If you are getting into this field just because it offers
    a high-paying job, then you should start thinking about other options. The only

    degrees, or a Ph.D. It doesn’t require lots of computing power or a huge dataset.
    It only requires your time and hard work. You can find amazing courses online
    and after learning a few skills, start applying those skills to your portfolio
    projects.
