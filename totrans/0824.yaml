- en: Businesses spend billions annually on advertising to increase their product
    awareness and interest among consumers leading to more purchases. Targeted advertisements
    or campaigns are launched to reach a broader audience in order to acquire new
    customers for their products. Advertisements are broadcasted through multiple
    media, it can be broadcasted on television, radio, magazines, online, through
    social media, and even in stores to reach a wide audience. Due to the abundance
    of options and the imperative to maximize return on investment (ROI), efficient
    allocation of advertising resources presents a significant challenge. This is
    where media mix modeling becomes paramount for businesses to optimize their advertisement
    spending and maximize their RoI. By estimating how much money should be spent
    on certain media channels to achieve specific goals (such as increased sales or
    brand awareness), media mix modeling is a useful tool for businesses. This allows
    them to compare various channels' performance and identify where there are opportunities
    for improvement, and spend resources sensibly. Data-driven insights allow businesses
    to fine-tune their marketing approaches, increase the value of their spending,
    and accelerate the process of reaching their business objectives. Media mix modeling
    is a statistical analysis technique where one analyzes historical advertisement
    data including spend, ad impressions or clicks delivered, product sales, new customers
    acquired, etc. in order to understand the impact of different media channels on
    business outcomes. This allows businesses to perform their advertisement budget
    portfolio optimization and increase their RoI.

    ROI 变得至关重要。通过估算在某些媒体渠道上应该花费多少资金以实现特定目标（如增加销售额或品牌知名度），媒体组合建模成为企业的有用工具。这使得企业能够比较各种渠道的表现，识别改进的机会，并合理分配资源。数据驱动的洞察使企业能够调整其营销方法，提高支出的价值，并加速实现业务目标的过程。媒体组合建模是一种统计分析技术，通过分析历史广告数据（包括支出、广告展示量或点击量、产品销售、新客户获得等）来理解不同媒体渠道对业务结果的影响。这使得企业能够优化广告预算组合，提升其
    ROI。

  zh: 什么是季节性，为什么它对媒体广告如此重要
- en: In simple terms, we can define seasonality as a characteristic of time series
    data in which we can observe predictable and regular behavior that gets repeated
    annually. Thus, we can say that any behavioral fluctuation that is predictable
    and recurs every year is a seasonal behavior.
  id: totrans-14

  zh: 简单来说，我们可以将季节性定义为时间序列数据的一种特征，其中我们可以观察到每年都会重复的可预测且规律的行为。因此，我们可以说任何可预测并且每年都会重复的行为就是季节性行为。
- en: But, how does seasonality differ from cyclical effect? Cyclical effects are
    the ones that can span over varying time periods. They may last longer or shorter
    than one year such as boosted sales of water filtration devices in a region due
    to some fault that might have occurred in the water pipeline. This kind of effect
    isn’t regular or predictable and might not repeat every year. Whereas, a boost
    in sales of flu medications due to flu season can be characterized as seasonal
    since it repeats every year from December to February and can be predicted.

  zh: 那么，季节性与周期性效应有何不同？周期性效应是指可以跨越不同时间段的效应。它们可能持续时间长于或短于一年，例如由于水管故障导致某地区水过滤设备销售的增加。这种效应并不规律或可预测，也可能不会每年重复。而流感季节导致流感药物销售的增加可以被称为季节性，因为它每年从12月到2月重复，并且可以预测。
- en: But why is seasonality important for media advertising? Seasonality primarily
    affects media mix modeling in two ways. Firstly, a change in media consumption
    patterns, and secondly a shift in advertising effectiveness is observed. As we
    discussed above how media mix modeling can help marketers understand the impact
    of various media channels on their sales or other key performance indicators such
    as new customer acquisitions. The incorporation of seasonality into these models
    enables advertisers to more accurately reflect the shifts in advertising performance
    that occur throughout the year. For instance, during the holiday seasons, various
    media channels may observe increased viewership or higher engagement, which makes
    them more successful in reaching their respective target audiences. Advertisers
    are able to maximize the effectiveness of their media allocation plans when they
    acknowledge and take into account seasonality. They are able to modify their advertising
    budgets, campaigns, and channel selection in order to align themselves with seasonal
    trends and the demand of consumers. This guarantees that marketing efforts are
    concentrated during times when they are most likely to generate maximum impact,
    hence optimizing the return on advertising investments.

  zh: 那么季节性为何对媒体广告如此重要？季节性主要在两个方面影响媒体混合建模。首先，观察到媒体消费模式的变化；其次，广告效果的变化。正如我们上面讨论的，媒体混合建模如何帮助营销人员了解各种媒体渠道对销售或其他关键绩效指标（如新客户获取）的影响。将季节性纳入这些模型使广告主能够更准确地反映全年广告绩效的变化。例如，在节假日期间，各种媒体渠道可能会观察到观众增加或参与度提高，这使得它们在接触各自目标受众时更加成功。当广告主认识到并考虑季节性时，他们能够最大化媒体分配计划的效果。他们能够调整广告预算、活动和渠道选择，以便与季节性趋势和消费者需求保持一致。这确保了营销工作在最有可能产生最大影响的时间集中，从而优化广告投资回报。

    model can be used when the variance of the time series doesn't change over different
