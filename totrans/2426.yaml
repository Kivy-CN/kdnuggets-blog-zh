    To use the ML Demo, you need to provide an image and ask a specific question.
    For example, “describe the image”. Learn more about use cases [here](https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/magma).'

    demo on Twitter, I thought they must be using a perfect example to show the outputs.
    But, when I tried it myself on a completely new photo, I was blown away by the
    simplicity and powerful functionality of the application. The Gradio demo asks
    you to upload the black&white and damaged image, and it will return a colored
    and high-quality photo. You can also play around with multiple options to get
    better results.

    month, the Spaces have outgrown Streamlit cloud, Heroku, and other cloud deployment
    platforms. In terms of ease of use, integrations, and faster inference. I am in
    love with HuggingFace Spaces and how community members are coming up with unique
    ideas for web applications. In this blog, we have covered the top ten list of
    machine learning demos on HF Spaces and learned how these applications work.
