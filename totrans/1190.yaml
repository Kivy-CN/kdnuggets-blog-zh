    it for real-time consumption. No matter how much data is good for business, it
    is still vulnerable to putting the privacy of millions of users at unimaginable
    risk. That is exactly why there is a sudden inclination towards more automated
    processes.

    that they will not survive any longer without a makeover. For example, enterprises
    are experimenting with micro-databases, each storing master data for a particular
    business entity only. There is also an increase in the adoption of self-servicing
    practices to discover, cleanse, and prepare data. They have understood the importance
    of embracing the ‘XOps’ mindset and delegate more important roles to MLOps and
    DataOps practices.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, MLOps are important because bringing ML models to execution is more difficult
    than training them or deploying them as APIs. The complication further worsens
    in the absence of governance tools. Ultimately, the ML models do not adapt to
    changes due to dynamic data influx leading to a non-performing end output.

    MLOps is everything between an ML model and its execution in live production.
    The process involves a thorough collaboration of data scientists with operational
    professionals such as ML/DL engineers. As a team, they experiment on different
    features such as parameters and hyperparameters. The objective is to speed up
    the model development & deployment, monitoring and approval of machine learning
    models.

    this occurs largely due to inefficient roadmap to production and communication
    gaps with the DevOps teams. With the automation in model deployment, MLOps addresses
    the issues with finesse. Since data science is all about dynamism, MLOps create
    adaptable transport pipelines, thereby accommodating models of all types. Moreover,

    provides a ‘store’ [for book-keeping](https://neptune.ai/product#what-is-metadata-store)
    all metadata sets. The Metadata store provides a user-friendly platform to perfect
    MLOps model management. Here, the data scientists can create logs, store & organize
    datasets, and query all metadata generated during the lifecycle of the MLOps model.
    Moreover, the dashboard provides ML experiment tracking, model registry, and instant
    access to the Metadata Database.

    to embrace a hybrid mindset. Therefore, a data delivery model supported by DataOps
    and MLOps ensures a stronger foundation for the long shot. Operationalizing data
    management at an enterprise scale is the only formula to achieve business agility.
    Therefore, enabling data that yields business value across dynamic use cases and
