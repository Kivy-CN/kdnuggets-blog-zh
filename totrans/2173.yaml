- en: Transfer learning means that a model trained for one task can be used for another
    similar task. You can then use a pre-trained model and make changes in it according
    to the required task. Let’s discuss the stages in transfer learning.

    resources as the pre-trained model has been initially trained for a large number
    of iterations for a specific dataset. This process has already captured essential
    features, so it reduces the workload for the new task.'

- en: '**Improves Performance**: Pre-trained models have learned from extensive datasets,
    so they generalize better. This leads to improved performance on new tasks, even
    when the new dataset is relatively small. The knowledge gained from the initial
    training helps in achieving higher accuracy and better results.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Needs Less Data**: One of the major benefits of transfer learning is its
    effectiveness with smaller datasets. The pre-trained model has already acquired
    useful pattern and features information. Thus, it can perform fairly even if it

    of data for the task concerned while fine-tuning generalized models. The drawback
    of this approach is that in case the new dataset is either small or significantly
    different from what fits the model at the beginning. To deal with this, one can
    put more data which will be more relevant to what the model already trained on.'

    high performance on validation data.'
