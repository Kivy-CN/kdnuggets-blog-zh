- en: There's an awful lot of text data available today, and enormous amounts of it
    are being created on a daily basis, ranging from structured to semi-structured
    to fully unstructured. What can we do with it? Well, quite a bit, actually; it
    depends on what your objectives are, but there are 2 intricately related yet differentiated
    umbrellas of tasks which can be exploited in order to leverage the availability
    of all of this data.

    between natural human languages and computing devices. NLP is a major aspect of
    computational linguistics, and also falls within the realms of computer science

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First off, the exact boundaries of these 2 concepts are not well-defined and
    agreed-upon (see data mining vs. data science), and bleed into one another to
    varying degrees, depending on the practitioners and researchers with whom you
    discuss such matters. I find it easiest to differentiate by *degree of insight*.
    If raw text is *data*, then text mining is *information* and NLP is *knowledge*
    (see the Pyramid of Understanding below). Syntax versus semantics, if you will.

    via the Venn diagram below, which also takes other related concepts into account
    in order to demonstrate the relationships and significant overlaps between a number

    and NLP exist, and you are free to find something that works better for you. We
    aren't really as concerned with the **exact** definitions -- absolute or relative
    -- as much as we are with the intuitive recognition that the concepts are related
    with some overlap, yet still distinct.

    same thing, they are closely related, deal with the same raw data type, and have
    some crossover in their uses. Importantly, much of the preprocessing of data for
    the tasks falling under these 2 umbrellas is identical.'
