    and ill-defined than ever before. It can be quite difficult for newcomers to figure
    out how to break into the field, and perhaps even more difficult, it can be for
    managers to figure out how to hire for positions unless you know exactly what
    you’re looking for.

    it is an even more ubiquitous prerequisite in this specific field. In many other
    technical fields, you can specialize in a set of skills and use these to drive
    business value for years on end — perhaps with the need to learn a new programming
    language or tool every X *years*. Data science, however, is inherently a *scientific* discipline
    that is developing *daily*.

    disagreeableness *(say your opinion and don’t be a sucker), and *extroversion *(talk
    with business, hold presentations, etc.)*, *as well as *openness *(research new

- en: The barrier to gaining broad experience is relatively low; actively participate
    in a few Kaggle competitions within various fields, then you should start to get
    a basic overview. Also, by doing this, you will be building a portfolio of what
    you can do. I’m not saying this is *easy *to do*, *just that it is easy to get
    started. Be sure that you get to the point where you fully understand it whenever
    you encounter a new concept in this process.

    I thank you ???? I realize that many of the raised points would apply to many
    professions, especially when it comes to similar jobs such as data engineering,
    cloud engineering, etc. These are my reflections from a data science perspective.
    Please note that I would never expect a junior developer to be a perfect fit for
    all of the mentioned points — rather, I would look for someone who can grow into
    all the mentioned points. Finally, I would love to get feedback on what other
    people are looking for in data science candidates, so feel free to drop a comment
    or reach out through any other channel.
