- en: MLOps is the idea of combining the long-established practice of DevOps with
    the emerging field of Machine Learning. It is the creation of an automated environment
    for model development, model retraining, drift monitoring, automation of pipeline,
    quality control, and governance of a model into a single platform.

- en: MLOps is a new branch of engineering disciplines. It’s a hybrid team of machine
    learning engineers, DevOps and data scientists which helps in retrieving the data,
    validating it, deploying the machine learning models, and training them with the
    proper datasets. MLOps also helps to monitor the model output to optimize the
    model, runs and produces the desired output seamlessly. MLOps is very helpful
    for deploying and training models and keeping track of the models and associated
    datasets.
