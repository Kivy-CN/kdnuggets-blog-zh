    any website, Python helps you achieve these tasks easily with its dedicated libraries
    such as **PyMySQL** and **BeautifulSoup,** respectively. The former enables you
    to easily connect with a MySQL database to execute queries and extract data while
    the latter helps you to read XML and HTML type data. After extracting and replacing
    values, you would also need to take care of missing data sets during the data
    cleansing phase and replace non-values accordingly.
