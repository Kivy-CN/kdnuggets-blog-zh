    as a strategy; one that aligns with your enterprise requirements and objectives.
    When it comes to selecting the right data integration strategy, the type, volume,
    and quality of data come into play. Based on these factors and several others,
    organizations decide whether to go for the manual or automatic approach for integration.

    of your enterprise data and its impact on your plans beyond the initial integration
    projects. The crux of the matter is that as your company grows, so will your data.
    Designing an integration strategy that accounts for this growth will help you
    establish your reputation as a data-driven organization.

    something bigger, such as migration or data warehousing. For instance, an organization
    initially looking to integrate their marketing and sales data may have the end
    goal of creating a master data management system with detailed customer records.
    Thus the goal of the project should be taken in regard when making the selection.

    This includes the resources for designing, maintaining, and scaling a constant
    flow of projects if you want to establish your reputation as a data-driven organization.
    Simultaneously, it may also require a company-wide change in regards to organizational
    functions, in addition to the technical ones. If you want to modify the data landscape
    of your company, make sure to work with stakeholders that understand how those
    changes impact the business and IT users working with data.

    tangible improvements for your organization. However, if you lean towards the
    manual approach, you won’t be able to incorporate these technologies in your data
    ecosystem without devoting a considerable amount of development time and developer
    resources. An integration strategy that is scalable enough to accommodate new
    technological advancements, like cloud-based apps and infrastructure, can bring
    significant improvements to the organization.

    several organizations still lean towards the manual integration approach. It’s
    a prevalent practice in small and medium-sized businesses. Even some large enterprises
    use SQL coding and stored procedures to extract and integrate data for reporting
    and analysis.

    such as cloud platforms or Hadoop. If a business user and coding novice can accomplish
    the same task using an ETL tool, and that too using less time, wouldn’t you rather
    use their expert skills for a more complicated task?

    are it will be a recurring one. In that case, it may be time-consuming to modify
    the code or find experts to maintain the tasks to sustain the integration flow.
    Whereas with one-time tasks, you’d be better off with manual coding.
