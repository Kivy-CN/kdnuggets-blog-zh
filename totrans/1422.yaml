    first step is to create a map that suits your life. Don’t go ahead and plan out
    an impossible pathway that requires you to learn for 12 hours a day every week.
    That’s just unrealistic, and you’ll experience burn out. Be more pragmatic when
    you plan your journey: Take into account your personal responsibilities, hobbies,
    friends, and family, etc.'

    their own learning methodology. Don’t try to be someone else and copy their way
    of learning. If you learn better through visualizations and videos, take MOOCs
    and go on YouTube. If you prefer the old-fashioned textbook-learning style, go
    ahead and do so. Nothing is stopping you from learning at your own pace.

- en: Distractions are everywhere. Without focus, it's almost impossible to learn.
    Having the discipline to control yourself and the self-awareness that distractions
    come from within, not externally, is the first step. Everything depends on you
    and you alone.

    depletion of time provides the impetus to start your work instead of putting it
    off for an episode of “Friends.” Next, sustain your focus, and get into *the zone, *as
    the programmers call it by setting up the right environment for yourself. Then,
    use timeboxing to make sure your productivity is at the maximum level. Finally,
    discover your mental power peaks to ensure you’re delegating creative tasks to
    moments when you’re highly energized and monotonous tasks for less active periods.

    can’t get anything done, go take a walk, play the piano, talk to your friends
    (in person). Then try to focus again.

    just by reading and memorizing is pointless. That’s the college methodology. It’s
    time to leave that behind and start learning effectively.

    better than absorbing passively. We’ve all learned things by doing, ever since
    we were infants. We study the world and formulate our very own framework.

    of concepts and facts into your brain. Install an IDE (PyCharm/VS Code), search
    up YouTube videos/websites with tutorials on how to implement machine learning,
    and choose a language (preferably Python). That’s it — that’s all you need to
    get the essence of machine learning and the flow of it.

    acumen, and machine learning all packed in their heads — and they’re prepared
    for whatever kinds of data people throw at them. With optimization learning, you’ll
    be prepared and ready to face any kind of hurdles that come your way.

- en: By knowing the essence of something, novel solutions to complex problems can
    be engendered. To achieve deep understanding, start by getting the basics right,
    and understand it inside out. Only with this fundamental knowledge of the groundwork
    can a person start branching out into more in-depth concepts in the semantic tree.

    of experience in the field and are adept in their workflow. By replicating how
    an expert solves a problem from top to bottom, you’ll eventually acquire the skills
    and expertise through repeated replication.

    Models can be biased and filled with errors — only with perpetual experimentation
    with different features (feature engineering) and with algorithms can one improve
    a model. By putting constraints on which features to choose and hybridizing your
    ML tools, you can create a good model.
