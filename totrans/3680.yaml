- en: A large Language Model or LLM is a deep learning language model designed to
    understand, interpret, and generate human language; it usually consists of millions
    to billions of neural network parameters and is trained using self-supervising.
    Examples of famous LLMs include GPT-4, BERT, and LLAMA.

    requirements and specifications, which becomes the gatekeeper to learning LLM.
    Luckily, we can experiment with various LLMs efficiently on our laptops using
    a Python package called [openplayground](https://github.com/nat/openplayground).

    can run on your laptop, and they are right. It’s a playground where we can experiment
    with the model, play around with the parameter, make model comparisons, and trace
    the log history with a friendly UI. They also use famous LLMs from several entities,
    such as OpenAI, HuggingFace, and more.

    Let’s go to the Settings tab initially, as we can’t work without providing the
    necessary information.

- en: When you open Settings, there will be a Providers section we need to choose.
    For this article example, we would use the one from OpenAI. Click the OpenAI and
    provide the API Key to have all the models accessible to the openplayground, similar
    to the image below.

    the ‘text-DaVinci-03’ model can show you the probabilities. Let’s submit the prompt
    once more and see the result.
