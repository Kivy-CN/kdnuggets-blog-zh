    language. Python and R are the two most commonly used languages in this domain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re just starting out, I strongly suggest learning Python. It is a lot
    more user-friendly than R and it is easier to pick up. Python also has a wide
    array of libraries that make tasks like data pre-processing a lot easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    web development or machine learning in the future, you won’t need to learn a new
