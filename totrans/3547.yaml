    There is[ a discussion on Quora](https://www.quora.com/Will-deep-learning-make-other-Machine-Learning-algorithms-obsolete)
    about whether deep learning will make other machine learning algorithms obsolete.
    Specifically, will related algorithms such as back propagation, HMM become obsolete
    like perceptrons?

- en: Empirical results over the past couple of years have shown that deep learning
    provides the best predictive power when the dataset is large enough. Is that true?
    Well I don’t know of a single example of where it has been beaten in predictive
    power for a dataset of over 100 million rows in the past year

    is because of the unsurpassed predictive power of deep learning especially on
    medium-to-large datasets. Other algorithms will become obsolete when people begin
    to consider deep learning as the first solution to some problems, such as pattern
    recognition.

    all other models and algorithms. Opinion from Jacob Steinhart received the most
    upvotes. He writes

    support vector machine will work just fine, and using a deep belief network will
    only complicate things.

    if one has domain knowledge then many other algorithms (such as HMMs for speech
    recognition, wavelets for images, etc.) can outperform them. There is some work
    being done to incorporate such domain knowledge into neural network models, but
    it is certainly not yet enough to fully replace all other models and algorithms.

    in the early 2000s. However, the complexity of deep learning and its requirement
    of large amount of data are still need to be solved before Deep Learning becomes
    the first choice for machine learning algorithms.
