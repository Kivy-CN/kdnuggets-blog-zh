    Here are my notes…

- en: There’s an old research-based adage that 93% of communication is nonverbal.
    55% of your communication is body language, 38% is voice tone, and 7% is spoken
    word.

    just disappears.

    and spoken word.**'

    vocal inflections and changing your volume**. Increasing your facial expressions
    and hand gestures can also improve the reception of your presentations. It might
    seem unnatural, but if you record your talks and rewatch them, you’ll be surprised
    at how normal and charismatic these changes appear.

    simple phrasing of complex topics, respectively. However, the content portion
    was really interesting.

    sentence from your presentation, so make it count. To do this, you need to understand
    their **technical level, expectations, and prior knowledge of the project**. If
    you tailor your talk to your audience, you can make that one sentence count.

    For instance, show a UX research video that supports your claim. By leveraging
    prior work, you save time, create a compelling presentation, and build relationships
    within the company.

    some freedom to select and develop their own projects. If the success of your
    work involves stakeholder buy-in, you must get them excited about the project.
