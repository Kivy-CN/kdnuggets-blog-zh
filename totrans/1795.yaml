    is multi-faceted. One important problem is managing data teams to get to that
    real world result. By using [agile data science methods](http://www.svds.com/tbt-successful-data-teams-are-agile-and-cross-functional/),
    we help data teams do fast and directed work, and manage the inherent uncertainty
    of data science and application development.

- en: It’s a fact that data science results are probabilistic and unpredictable. At
    the start of a project, it can often look like there’s an obvious route from A
    to B. When you get started, it’s never that simple. Agile teams do away with strict
    planning and go into projects with a creative mindset; they embrace uncertainty
    instead of shying away from it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This comes in handy when a roadblock pops up—traditionally-run data science
    teams can get stuck deciding on their options, while the flexible agile data science
    teams are more likely to find a new solution. Unpredictability and the need to
    adapt quickly to problems doesn’t scare them; it excites them.

- en: At the same time, the agile planning method focuses hard on application to the
    customer’s problem. Otherwise, it’s easy for us to get lost down the rabbit hole
    of stringent rules about hypotheses, models, and results. In the latter scenario,
    we end up producing things that work—that validate our hypotheses—but that have
    little application to the real world scenario we’re producing them for. Wasting
    time is not good for us or our customers.

    problem. At SVDS, we used this method to create a system that tells train riders
    when the Caltrain is running late to a stop, and its approximate time of arrival.
    Let’s dive into how that worked.

- en: I’ll give a brief overview of our Caltrain work, but if you want to learn more
    check out our [project page](http://www.svds.com/project/listening-caltrain/).
    The point of this project, its *charter*, was to create an app that would tell
    the user when the Caltrain was running late, and how long it would be until it
    arrived at a designated stop. The Caltrain system has its own app, but it suffered
    from being inaccurate, and didn’t tell riders if a train was late, and how late
    it was. No one likes being late for work, so we wanted to create a solution for
    them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The next step was to define the *investigation themes*, which started with
    the question: “how do I know the train is late?”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *epics* portion included all the smaller questions and tasks required to
    answer the big questions posited in the investigation themes. Epics included undertakings
    such as “develop a working model for the Caltrain system under regular working
    conditions,” and “classify catastrophic events in the system that prevent the
    regular working model from applying.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the epics are broken down into units of work, the *stories* resulted. Example
    stories included “can I accurately and consistently use Twitter to find data on
    the train’s late times?” and “can I identify the direction of the train using
    video?”

- en: Given the breakdown of work into epics and stories, how do you manage its execution
    and planning? This happens through sprints, standups, and review meetings. You’ll
    find that different agile practitioners have differing spins on these meetings,
    but the fundamentals are all similar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Sprints**. Stories are completed during sprints, which is a set chunk of
    time to work on tasks, typically two weeks, with the goal of producing new results.
    A sprint starts with sprint planning, where we’ll decide, with customer stakeholders,
    which epics to start or continue. Data scientists will break these down into stories
    for that sprint.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Standups**. Each day during the sprint, the team gathers in a standup meeting.
    Here they report their progress, say what they’re going to do next, and coordinate
    to remove blockers where people are stuck on their work. Standups, as their name
    suggests, aren’t for long discussions or problem solving. The point is to get
    information out there quickly, and set up any further discussion. Optionally,
    a customer stakeholder may attend these standup meetings. Alternatively, we schedule
    one or two updates with them separately each week. It’s important to keep them
    closely involved with progress.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Review meetings**. The last step in the sprint process is to hold a review
    meeting, where the team presents and evaluates results. Customer stakeholders
    also attend this meeting. We present the work, and the group discusses it. Is
    it good enough? Should we keep working on it? Will it be useful, or should we
    abandon it now? We typically combine our review meetings, which are an assessment
    of the work done, with our sprint retrospective meetings, which are an assessment
    of how the work was done.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This keeps the group from spending long periods of time working on things that
    won’t actually benefit customers. If the work is incomplete, you discuss how to
    move forward. If it’s finished, you discuss what you learned from the experience.
    Agile teams are always learning from previous work.

- en: Agile data science teams work in a way that is adaptable, collaborative, and
    produces usable results. They subscribe to the idea that data science can be creative
    and innovative. They embrace the unknown instead of making assumptions, and they
    don’t waste time beating their head against a wall for things that aren’t working.

    together to make things that are useful, and answer real world problems. The future
    is fickle, and we must be flexible to succeed.
