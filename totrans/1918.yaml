- en: Most of the mathematics required for Data Science lie within the realms of statistics
    and algebra, which explains the disproportionate number of these courses listed
    below. A few other areas are included to round out the list, including calculus,
    finite mathematics, and a few more advanced offerings; however, the essence of
    the skills on parade here are statistical and algebraic in nature.

- en: Statistics, in particular, is at the very foundation of Data Science, and is
    the collection of tools which helps us separate significance from randomness.
    Algebra is quite often at the heart of the analysis itself. The further quantitative
    skills facilitate intuition, which is essential in analytics.
