    exception. As AI and data evolve and play a more prominent role in our day-to-day
    lives, AI has needed to throw up the bat signal for years. You know the story
    - millions of investments with little ROI.

    that’s keeping AI from reaching its full potential. For AI, the villain is *two-faced*.
    While data is one of the essential components of building reliable and robust
    AI models, data is also one of the most significant barriers to AI adoption.

    lack of data quality and quantity are some of the biggest hurdles for AI adoption.
    Successful AI initiatives need large amounts of data to draw information about
    the best response to a situation. AI can falter without sufficient data or if
    new scenarios don’t match past data. The more complex a situation is, it’s more
    likely the AI’s existing data won’t be sufficient.'

- en: In the visual domain, synthetic data has shown promise in creating more capable
    and ethical AI models. Synthetic data is computer-generated image data that models
    the real world. Technologies from the visual effects industry are coupled with
    generative neural networks to create vast, diverse, and photorealistic labeled
    image data. A synthetic data set is created artificially rather than through real-world
    data, allowing for training data to be developed at a fraction of the cost and
    time of current approaches. Like Bruce Wayne, synthetic data has many tricks up
    its sleeve.

- en: Currently, it’s common for most AI systems to leverage ‘supervised learning’
    or the process in which humans label and effectively teach AI how to interpret
    images. This process is time- and resource-intensive and fundamentally limited,
    as humans do not scale and, more importantly, cannot label key attributes such
    as 3D position, interactions, etc. Additionally, concerns with AI demographic
    bias and consumer privacy have amplified, making it increasingly difficult to
    obtain representative human data.

- en: For consumer-centric applications like smartphones and smart homes, ensuring
    privacy is paramount. Synthetic data can ultimately eliminate the use of real
    humans in building consumer-centric applications. Since synthetic data is generated
    artificially, this eliminates many biases and privacy concerns with traditionally
    collecting data sets from the real world.

    process. Deploying the necessary hardware can be prohibitively expensive for complicated
    computer vision systems like autonomous vehicles, robotics, or satellite imagery.
    Once the data is captured, humans label and annotate essential features, which
    is prone to error and costly.

    of computer vision models and products. It is orders of magnitude faster and cheaper
    than traditional human-annotated real-data approaches and will come to accelerate
    the deployment of new and more capable models across industries.

    everyday citizen. As mentioned earlier, humans are limited in their capacity to
    accurately label key attributes that help computer vision systems interpret the
    world around them. Companies are limited by the availability of sufficiently diverse
    and accurately human-labeled datasets. Currently, the time and cost to acquire
    and label image data are immense. A fundamental limitation of this approach is
    that a human worker can’t label all the attributes a company might be interested
    in.

    is artificially generated and labeled data that models the real world. New labels
    provided by synthetic data approaches related to 3D position, depth, and new sensor
    systems will allow for the development of new and more capable models for applications
    like autonomy, robotics, and AR/VR/metaverse.

    datasets powering AI models can be unbalanced with certain classes of data and
    either over or underrepresented groups of people. This can lead to gender, ethnicity,
    and age biases in AI data sets. Enter synthetic data.

- en: Instead of being extracted from real-world events or phenomena, synthetic data
    is generated partially or entirely artificially. If the dataset is not diverse
    or large enough, AI-generated data can fill in the gaps and form a more comprehensive,
    unbiased data set. This allows AI scientists to create balanced datasets, helps
    organizations meet regulatory and compliance requirements, and builds more fair
    and ethical AI systems.

    The autonomous vehicle driving travelers to the airport, the virtual work meeting

    on computer vision applications powered by vast datasets. Synthetic data’s superpowers
    will play a vital role in ensuring those data sets are ethical, unbiased, economical,
