    neural networks. Actually, deep neural networks can only recognize the left correctly,
    but can not recognize the right ones. Interesting, isn’t it?

    as a feature and looks for input images which maximize the activation value of
    this single feature. We can interpret these features into meaningful variations
    in the input domain. However, the experiments show that such interpretable semantic
    also works for any random directions (lower images).

    black circle and fan-shaped white region will be most likely classified as white
    flowers. However, it turns out that if we pick a random set of basis, the images
    responded can also be semantically interpreted in a similar way.

    continuity and stability of deep neural networks are questioned. The smoothness
    assumption does not hold for deep neural networks any more.

    which was trained on a different training dataset, to misclassify the same image.
    It means that adversarial examples are somewhat universal.

- en: This result may change our way to manage training/validation datasets and edge
    cases. It has been supported by the experiments that if we keep a pool of adversarial
    examples and mix it into the original training set, the generalization will be
    improved. Adversarial examples for the higher layer seem to be more useful than
    those on the lower layers.

    were applied to criminal detection, security devices or banking systems. If we
    keep digging deeper, do such adversarial images exist in our brain? Scary, isn’t
    it?
