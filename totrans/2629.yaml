- en: The Machine Learning as a service (MLaaS) market is booming. It is expected
    to grow to[ $8.48 billion by 2025](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-machine-learning-as-a-service-mlaas-market),
    at 43% CAGR. Increased cloud adoption and the need to better comprehend customer
    behavior are expected to be the driving factors propelling the market, going forward.
    There’s a clear inclination towards the MLaaS model across industries, given the
    fact that companies today have an option to select from a wide range of solutions
    that can cater to diverse business needs. Additionally, the proliferation of  IoT,
    automation and AI-driven systems across industries will only amplify the need
    for MLaaS as a foundation to all these technologies.

- en: Data Science and ML platforms provide companies with the much-needed tools to
    develop, deploy and monitor ML algorithms. These smart platforms combine data
    with intelligent, decision-making algorithms that include functionalities for
    voice recognition, image recognition, natural language processing (NLP) and so
    on.

- en: There are several ML platforms available in the market. Selecting the right
    solution, however, can be a daunting task – one that needs thorough research and
    comparison beyond just the solutions and the core technical capabilities. In order
    to make the task a little easier, we have profiled the top three ML platforms
    in one place for review.

- en: IBM Watson studio or Watson Machine Learning is essentially an amalgamation
    of IBM cloud services focused on the creation, training, and deployment of neural
    networks and ML models. By leveraging the Watson Machine Learning platform, companies
    can develop analytical models and simultaneously train the same with their own
    data and integrate them into native applications.

    platform to develop, test and deploy predictive data solutions. Azure makes the
    process of creating ML models easy and accessible. This ensures that the developed
    models can be accessed by a larger audience group within a short time-frame. Additionally,
    this platform also makes it easier for data scientists and engineers to start
    mining predictive data. This makes it an ideal option for the ones with little
    to no experience.

    Flow, Kuberflow, and Cloud ML Engine. It includes a complete range of machine
    learning services like data preparation, data tuning, and data training. Data
    scientists can leverage this platform to deploy and share ML models and collaborate
    on its improvement.

- en: Selecting the right ML Platform among the myriad of options available out there
    can be an overwhelming proposition. Each solution can be differentiated in terms
    of algorithms, skill sets required to operate the platform and tasks performed.
    So, how you go about picking that one platform that will cater holistically to
    all your business needs depends on what your company intends to achieve through
    the machine learning program. The trick is to rightly align data science with
    your long term business objectives. Once you achieve this, selecting a platform
    that ticks all the right boxes will become easier.
