    social networks. But what can it do for sports analytics? What if we model soccer
    passes as a network? Can we learn which team is more likely to win? Can we identify
    critical players to pressure the opposing team? Can we identify opportunities
    to improve our team’s performance?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A ‘network’ is the everyday word for what data science calls a graph. In analytics,
    a graph is a formal way to represent a group of interconnected objects. This is
    borrowed from math where graphs are defined as ordered pairs that include a set
    of nodes and a set of edges.

    that not all nodes are the same. It weights each node based on its relative influence.

    to retain only passing events. Then create directed weighted graphs for each of
    the 32 teams using the 34,580 observed passes during regular play.  This number
    excludes 28,292 passes during throw-ins, period starts, corner kicks, etcetera.

    won on paper. They stand out as having the best passing metrics. Panama is at
    the other end of the spectrum. France is highlighted because they won where it

    to win the World Cup, but it is the ante to reaching the semi-finals.*** It’s

    see if this checks out with observable evidence we can search for “Toni Kroos

    by passing network transitivity, which is a measure of how tightly each subgroup
    of three players is connected. We will contrast with Panama who is at the other

- en: Right off we see Brazil’s players are more tightly grouped in comparison to
    Panama. Brazil utilizes shorter passes and there is less difference between the
    most and least influential passers. As we would expect, the defensive backs (the
    lightly shaded nodes) tend to be on the right of the plot with passes that travel
    further downfield.

- en: The scouting report for Brazil might suggest trying to disrupt Neymar who is
    the most influential player in the team’s passing network. But this plot indicates
    that may be ineffective because there is not a significant gap with the rest of
    the team. However, we do see a heavy edge between Neymar and Countinho. This suggests
    that clogging the passing lanes between these two players might be helpful.

    midfielder, is the most influential player in the Panama passing network. Putting
    increased pressure on Godoy may have a disruptive impact on the team.
