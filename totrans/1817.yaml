    the chance to engage with a number of employers, clients for their data science
    needs both as an employee and entrepreneur across multiple domains starting with
    Financial Services, Retail/FMCG/CPG, Telecom, Media and Entertainment, Digital
    Media, Education and Technology etc. During the last 11 years, I had the chance
    to observe and participate in the management practices and enterprise strategy
    with regards to data science and have closely observed the success and failures
    of those initiatives. I look back and reflect on the top 5 reasons that in my
    view inhibit the growth of Data Science Strategy.

- en: Some companies joined the bandwagon of data science because they wanted to be
    part of hype rather than be part of real value creation. These superficial goals
    often reflect that the top leadership is either not fully convinced about the
    effectiveness of data based strategy or was undertaking it due to one person’s
    fancy love (not the real knowledge) for the word “big data”. In the absence of
    clear mandate for data science as an input for business strategy, the organizational
    goals never got synced with the data science road-map and that led to unrealistic
    targets thereby resulting in abysmal failure.

    regards to Data Science (irrespective whether your business model is B2B or B2C)
    is to embrace change. Often the rigid hierarchies, departmental silos, complex
    political organizational dynamics become a barrier in implementing a central data
    strategy that does not foster real innovation. Everyone wants to stake a claim
    of the portion of the pie or the complete pie itself without knowing whether they
    are the right person in the first place to stake that claim or without understanding
    the changes it would involve in the ecosystem in ownership of a portion of that
    pie.

    example: to implement nearly real time campaign response/next best offer model
    that is deployed in production, one might require synergy between different departments
    like Marketing, Sales, IT, Finance but that sometimes fails due to power play
    of different stakeholders and lack of willingness to embrace change which calls
    for harmonizing and unifying data and inputs from different sources and a closer
    synergy between different key stakeholders of those departments (who traditionally
    until that point were acting in silos for whatever political reasons).'

    barriers between groups are demolished and the data is unified. Politics often
    becomes a barrier. Or even if it is not possible to have a central data science
    structure, then a loosely held data science center of competence or excellence
    (resulting from a close partnership between 2 teams-For example IT and Marketing
    (or any other business function relevant to the data strategy) can be created
    that effectively engages to build a robust use case to solve a problem that becomes
    an example for other departments to follow the lead. If organisational dynamics
    do not allow even that, an Experimental Data Science Labs could be created which
    does not fall within the borders of specific Department/Team (but still has free
    access to the data source systems for experimentation, a parallel unit/team to
    existing technology units/teams) and is free from the politically motivated agendas
    and is headed by an able, objective leader (more on that in the next point-the
    'go to' person).

    initiatives are only undertaken to showcase involvement with data rather than
    the actual need. Flawed Hypothesis are built, leading to numerous hidden assumptions
    that result in crap business use cases. Effective Data Science is a healthy combination
    of Domain, Data, Mathematics and Statistics, Algorithms, Programming, Research/Experimentation
    and Art or simply science and art. We can automate science, but it is difficult
    to automate art or quantify what is abstract. Modeling rare events is so tricky
    and the best example of that is the recent US election where trump defeated all
    the opinion polls, predictions and all the experts fell flat on their face.'

    for political reasons wherein each stakeholder either wants to protect his territory
    or expand his existing territory. A ‘domain/business expert’ would try to emphasize
    the domain or the art to showcase his importance and stamp his authority in the
    area of communication and business strategy and would often come up with fancy
    questions without even knowing if there is supporting data for the same or whether
    it results in a useful metric or not, the Data Scientist would try to over-emphasize
    the mathematical part to showcase why every problem needs to be solved using mathematics
    and how PCA could solve a supply chain optimization problem even when there might
    be no need for it, and the data engineer would try to emphasize the technology
    (data warehousing) or implementation part to showcase why his role is no less
    than that of an Astronaut, which is such a prejudiced debate that the right question
    is often lost in the background. Each of them is important but they need to operate
    in tandem.

    hypothesis/business question under consideration. And that business question has
    to be tied back to specific goal or a metric and lot of times that is an empty
    field and an empty field for metric does not qualify for deployment. Even a periodicity
    of 12 model runs per year or even greater does not qualify for deployment unless
    you are producing a business metric that strongly ties back to the initial hypothesis
    and adds incremental value to the business.

- en: In the absence of the right question, what would technology or implementation
    guy do? Implement a flawed hypothesis-does it make sense? And if we reverse the
    equation-in the presence of the right question but a wrong technical implementation/adoption
    of algorithm/model/sample (that fails miserably on out of time samples)-does that
    help either, which again takes me back to the point 2 above-lack of synergy between
    different stakeholders. An objective leader who has a right combination of strong
    Business/domain context (big picture) with equally strong Data Science context
    (core technical aspects in terms of core Data Science/Analytics topics) and is
    also open to embrace change could be your ‘go to’ man, but these people come at
    a premium and even if you find these people you need to allow them to function
    with freedom and authority to set up that ecosystem but that freedom and flexibility
    is often missing. Frustrated with the system, they often leave (for lack of acknowledgement
    for their passion and commitment to the cause by the management)

- en: Every organization has numerous data sources and hence several hypothesis around
    the same that need to be prioritized in the order of incremental business value
    we can extract out of them and also according to the quality of data available.
    In the absence of that-we often waste time and resource on low value business
    questions that would not have generated much incremental value in terms of business
    outcome. To ensure that, we need to streamline activities around data sourcing
    and storage across all business functions to improve the quality of available
    data for analysis and then prioritize it according to the business value. Every
    Model is as good as its data and that needs to be always remembered.

    Data Science projects with a Defined Beginning and Outcome could be a blunder
    as before an Organization reaches stability in its Analytics and Data Science
    paradigm, it will go through an extensive period (couple of years at-least or
    even more) of trial and error phase of what works and what does not, what data
    is relevant, what model performs and what model needs to be deployed eventually
    that produces a useful business metric that generates an incremental impact. The
    flexibility and agility to learn quickly from mistakes has to be part of DNA of
    the system but typically lot of people believe that Analytics/Data Science is
    a magic wand, and a button click of the algorithm will radically change the business
    outcomes for good-nothing could be more stupid than this. That is a sad reality.'
