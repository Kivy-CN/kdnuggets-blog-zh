    unparalleled rate since the outbreak of the epidemic that has led the entire world
    to go digital. Organizations have experienced an exponential increase in footfall
    on their web properties and become data-rich.

- en: Once the business objective is decided, the executives bake it into their strategic
    goals which is what the business wants to position itself in the next three to
    five years. Needless to say, it is a multi-year journey and requires careful planning
    to decide what initiatives should be picked in the current year and succeeding
    years thereafter to enable the business to reach its overall strategic goals.
  prefs: []

- en: Additionally, the strategist splits the yearly goals into each quarter's goals
    by evaluating what set of tasks establishes the groundwork for the coming quarters.
    In short, the strategist along with the leaders from cross-disciplinary teams
    works out the dependencies to hash out the goals and objectives for each quarter.

- en: There are so many initiatives that can be worked upon to meet business goals,
    but you might not know in advance which ones to pick to generate business value
    in the most optimized and efficient way. You can not work on all ideas and perform
    the post-analysis to assess the efficacy of each of them. It is expensive with
    respect to the time and resources to execute all the initiatives at once and assess
    their feasibility.

    goals and converts them into a fine-grained and well-defined roadmap in an endeavor
    to prioritize the key projects.

    well-laid-out plan that calls out the action items and successfully takes a strategy
    from the design stage through the execution.

- en: It's a typical problem of a trade-off between how much time you spend to design
    the foolproof and most optimized strategy versus when to seal the design part
    and get started with the strategy execution. A large part of AI strategy draws
    its characteristics from the experimentative nature of AI projects. You may not
    have all the requirements, dependencies, and risks foreseen before you delve deep
    into it. Hence, an AI strategy assumes constant reprioritization and needs agility
    and the ability to recalibrate the project scope as it advances to the next stage.

    of waiting for all the information and inputs to be perfectly made available.
    It is also called a problem of cold start.

    the fear is valid too. What if you pick the wrong project at the very beginning
    – you might lose enthusiasm and get discouraged at the beginning of the journey
    itself. It might take six months or a year to iterate through hit and trial but
    after one or one-and-a-half years, your initiative has to start showing returns.
    After a point, it becomes very difficult to kill a project and start afresh with
    a new project.

    which needs to be strategized well in terms of having an in-house expert who can
    help onboard with new technology. Not just the technology adoption crucial, but
    the overall solution needs to be adopted well within the organization.
