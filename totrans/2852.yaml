- en: Researchers, entrepreneurs, and policy-makers are increasingly using AI to tackle
    development challenges. In other words,** using AI for a greater good is a real
    thing**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Several studies and prototypes have been run to prove the value of AI in high-impact
    fields such as healthcare (Chunara et al., 2012; Caicedo-Torres et al., 2016;
    Pathak and Kumar 2016; Robertson and DeHart 2010; Waidyanatha et al., 2013) or
    environmental issues (Tehrany et al., 2014; Ferris, 2010; Tien Bui et al., 2012;
    Kapoor et al., 2010). However, it is becoming clear that **AI poses as many threats
    as benefits**, although the former ones are usually neglected.

    piece (if you want, [here there is more](https://medium.com/@Francesco_AI/machine-ethics-and-artificial-moral-agents-85ad6b71d40b)),
    but avoiding the negative effects of AI is why incorporating a set of ethical
    principles into our technology development process is so paramount. Ethics plays
    a key role by ensuring that regulations of AI harness its potential while mitigating
    its risks (Taddeo and Floridi, 2018) and it would help us understand how to use
    responsibly the power coming from this technology. In fact, if from one hand AI
    can increase efficiency, access, and productivity, on the other side it might
    constraint resources and increase inequalities (Vinuesa et al., 2019).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, **AI is a neutral technology, it is intrinsically good and bad at the
    same time** (or none of the two, if you like), but we need to be sure to frame
    correctly its applications and uses. In a seminal paper, Floridi et al. (2018)
    highlight twenty different action points for a Good AI Society. Their analysis
    has a strong focus on Europe and concerns policy and ethical issues, but for the
    sake of using AI for good, I believe a few of those points are really cornerstones.
  prefs: []

- en: Assessing tasks that should not be delegated to an AI; developing auditing mechanisms
    to identify unwanted consequences and to compensate for a wrong caused by AI;
    financially incentivize cross-disciplinary collaboration. Some of the challenges
    listed in the paper will arise regardless of AI be present in our lives and could
    then be fixed by different solutions, but those I have just mentioned are so uniquely
    linked to data-driven applications to have to be considered when using AI for
    social applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, even if we would be able to score everything correctly, and not jeopardize
    the outcomes through a bad unethical design process, there is no certainty that
    the applications of AI would result in a better society or a healthier planet.
    We need first to overcome other bottlenecks.

- en: If the limitations of implementing AI products and services in the developing
    world are known (Ali et al., 2016; Hilbert, 2016), it is also fairly clear they
    have a positive impact in those areas of the world (Dias and Brewer, 2009; Quinn
    et al., 2014). Machine learning can indeed be used to improve data reliability,
    inform policy and decision-makers, and be used “*without intermediaries*” since
    it can be directly built into deployed systems (De-Arteaga et al., 2018).

- en: But how can we be sure that AI is effective in solving some of the world's most
    pressing challenges?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, first of all, we need to remove roadblocks in the technical development
    of complex intelligent systems. **Infrastructure constraints** are probably the
    most common and widespread in developing countries. The lack of computational
    power, the difficulty in repairing systems and sensors given the long travel distances,
    the lack of big storage systems, the scarce internet accessibility, and the overall
    limited financial resources, make using AI incredibly hard in many of those countries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second big challenge concerns **talents**. The lack of available and accessible
    specialized talent and the absence of a strong technical community complicate
    the effective use of any data-driven system. Finally, the **absence of (quality)
    data** is the last ingredient toward this recipe for (potential) disaster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But where there is a problem lies also an opportunity. If transfer learning,
    data prioritization, or alternative datasets are nothing more than an exotic academic
    effort in many fields and mature economies, in developing countries are a necessity,
    and this may push forward the boundaries of the research.
  prefs: []

    only be within sight, but it would be of a magnitude way higher than any other
    tool we used before.

    prosperity. It is natural then to link the AI applications to those principles,
    but always keep in mind that AI can act both as an **enabler** as well as an **inhibitor** for
    each of these SDGs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, I want to highlight here some positive examples, but also stress again
    that the impact AI has on each SDG is different in magnitude and direction — in
    other words, AI can provide many more benefits to the *environment* rather than
    other fields, and have a stronger negative effect on *society* with respect to,
    for example, the *economy* or the *environment *(Vinuesa et al., 2019).

    which has to be clear is that regardless of the action of institutional players

    should probably start wondering what we can personally do to foster these efforts
    in our everyday life.
