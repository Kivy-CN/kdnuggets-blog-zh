- en: In order to implement computational solutions to data science problems, it is
    clear that programming is an absolute necessity. Regardless of whether you are
    visualizing data, performing exploratory data analysis, or implementing machine
    learning models, and whether you are using existing code bases and libraries or
    coding from scratch, writing code as a data scientist is required.

    be the goal of an aspiring data scientist (or anyone else learning to program).
    An understanding of computer science principles, computational approaches to problem
    solving, and the fundamentals of programming, all independent of implementation
    programming language, should be the goal of anyone with a true desire to *really*
    learn how to code.

    science. Obviously, some people will learn better with some approaches than with
    others. Thorough university courses, including lectures, readings, slides, and
    assignments, are one such approach.

    [**Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/),
    a structured approach to learning the concepts of computer science and programming.
    Taught by Dr. Ana Bell, Prof. Eric Grimson, and Prof. John Guttag, this course
    seeks to impart a comprehensive set of computer science fundamentals upon newcomers
    to programming.

- en: 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended
    for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students
    with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and
    to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their
    ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The
    class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.

    dominant programming languages used in data science, and [one of the most popular
    general purpose programming languages](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) in widespread
    use today.

    in September 2016 and uses Python 3.5, the fundamentals of computer science and
    programming are much more static than outsiders tend to believe, and so do not
    be turned off by the fact that this iteration of the course is four years old.
    It really is still very much relevant.

    at sellers like Amazon if you are interested in following along with the readings.
    If not, the lecture videos, notes, and other resources still provide a rich learning
    experience in sum.
