    and failure. Yet, we so often see great Python developers and SQL experts producing
    fantastic technology that adds little value to the business. In some cases, it
    is far worse. Rather than debatable value, the solutions drain resources and muddle
    business process. As data engineers, it is our responsibility to fully understand
    the business processes our solutions support.

- en: As senior data engineers, we should understand the business so well, we recommend
    efficiencies and enhancements to how work is done. A bold statement, but I’ll
    die on this sword comfortably and fight anyone who disagrees. Figuratively, of
    course, since I don’t have a sword and am more of a lover than a fighter. The
    point is, we need to understand the business, and there is one essential tool
    that helps us get there.

    the business process going along with it doesn’t seem nearly as important these
    days as the ability to move data around.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What he’s saying here is that we are so consumed with moving data from there
    to here and all the cool tools we can do it with, we’ve forgotten the reasons
    why we do it all in the first place. Data engineers collect raw data from multiple
    sources and create consumable packages that enable effective use for humans and
    machines. Everything in between is a black box to our consumers. Why is it that
    we spend most of our time and energy on the black box instead of the consumable
    packages?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cynical view would say it is because the black box is the fun part. While
    that may factor into the equation, I believe many of us just don’t understand
    business processes well enough to effectively spend time on improving the consumable
    packages. Let me be clear. It is your job and your responsibility to better understand
    the business. It’s not easy. In a perfect world, we’d have great documentation
    to rely on, but… well… you know. This is where we get to the most important tool
    in our data-engineering toolbox.

- en: Questions. There it is. Questions. Lots of them. Good ones. Bad ones. Embarrassing
    ones. All THE QUESTIONS! Is that enough emphasis for you? Do you want to go from
    good to great? Ask questions and fully understand the business processes you support. I
    can’t emphasize enough how frustrating it is talking to a data engineer who is
    only concerned with technology, and I am a data engineer. Imagine being a finance
    analyst, HR lead, or someone in sales. They need consumable packages of data but
    may not understand the technical jargon. They may have very little understanding
    of technology beyond the specific tools they use.

- en: Therefore, it is not good enough to just ask questions. Instead, we need to
    ask the right questions in a language the business understands. Forget about tables,
    data sources and primary keys. These things come later and are often determined
    by even more questions to even more people. Instead, ask about what people do
    in their day-to-day work. Ask what the business goals are. How work flows through
    various systems. Ask until you fully understand the business processes the company
    uses. Then document it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Write the business documentation. Sure, it is their job to do it, but you are
    the one who needs it. Create flowcharts including any tools the business uses.
    Include where people interact with the processes. Then review it with the business
    and ask more questions. You’ll likely find that no single person understands everything,
    so you’ll talk to several people and end up unifying the business processes. The
    documentation you write will become a valuable artifact for the business. Bam!
    You have just become invaluable to the company. Dare I say, you just became a
    senior data engineer?

    our solutions support. Without fully understanding these processes, we are doomed
    to frustration and failure. The imperfect world we live in is usually poorly documented,
    and we data engineers are the ones who need to figure it all out. By asking lots
    and lots of questions, we better understand the business processes our solutions
    support and this enables us to continually improve the impact of our work. So,
    get to it. Question everything!

    adventure at Krispy Krabcakes. She had tons of fun and provided a great primer
