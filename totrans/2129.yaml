    Microsoft has been working hard to release a number of small language models (SLMs)
    called ‘Phi’. This series of models has been shown to achieve remarkable performance,
    just as it was a large language model.

    the 1.3 billion parameter and then came [Phi-1.5](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1_5).

    language model that has been shown to demonstrate outstanding reasoning and language
    understanding capabilities.

- en: Phi-2 has been shown to outperform models which are 25x larger. And that’s all
    thanks to model scaling and training data curation. Small, compact, and highly
    performant. Due to its size, Phi-2 is for researchers to explore interpretability,
    fine-tuning experiments and also delve into safety improvements. It is available
    on the Azure AI Studio model catalogue.

    quality content that has educational value. That with the ability to scale has
    taken their 1.3 billion parameter model, Phi-1.5 to a 2.7 billion parameter Phi-2.
