- en: Code is one of the fundamental building blocks in machine learning research.
    Engineers already are in the habit of publishing code to share with the community,
    and it is now becoming standard for researchers to publish their code online as
    well. Increasingly more ML conferences are making it a requirement.

    previously worked at Tesla -- where he was automating manufacturing testing for
    Tesla PowerWall, PowerPack, and SuperCharger. He is also a TEDx speaker on bias
    due to AI (especially for women and minorities) and on intelligent transportation.
    Alongside that, he is a SXSW judge, Kairos Society fellow, Hackernoon top publisher,
    and earlier on, he co-founded a SpaceX Hyperloop team with schools like Cornell,
    Princeton, and UMichigan and their prototype placed top 10 internationally --
    and was featured on CNN, The Verge, Wired, and CNBC. Himanshu is a fellow of Kairos
    Society -- an elite club of founders that identify society’s most pressing challenges
    and build new solutions to address them (with mentors like Sir Richard Branson,
    Bill Clinton, and Hayden of the CIA). He was previously awarded the NSERC (NSF
    equivalent in Canada) Industrial Undergraduate Student Research Award, open-sourced
    a 3D-printed prosthetic for US veteran amputees, led a drone robotics team, and
    judged top robotics contests (SXSW, PennApps, Lego League). Lastly, Himanshu helped
    design an innovative electronic music instrument that was featured on CBC and
    DigitalTrends.'
