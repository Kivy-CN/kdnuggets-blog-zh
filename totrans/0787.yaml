    beautiful, informative data viz can be time-consuming and require specialized
    tools. That's where ChatGPT comes in. With its latest updates, ChatGPT makes data
    visualization faster and easier than ever before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The latest update has improved the ChatGPT experience significantly. Now, instead
    of having to switch between different options like the original GPT-4, GPT4 with
    advanced analysis, or DALLE-3, you simply need to type in a prompt, and ChatGPT
    will automatically interpret your request and generate the desired results.
