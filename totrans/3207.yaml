- en: Another type of machine learning is **reinforcement learning**. In reinforcement
    learning, the goal is to develop a system (**agent**) that improves its performance
    based on interactions with the environment. Since the information about the current
    state of the environment typically also includes a so-called **reward signal**,
    we can think of reinforcement learning as a field related to supervised learning.
    However, in reinforcement learning this feedback is not the correct ground truth
    label or value, but a measure of how well the action was measured by a reward
    function. Through its interaction with the environment, an agent can then use
    reinforcement learning to learn a series of actions that maximizes this reward
    via an exploratory trial-and-error approach or deliberative planning.

    decides upon a series of moves depending on the state of the board (the environment),
    and the reward can be defined as **win** or **lose** at the end of the game:'

- en: There are many different subtypes of reinforcement learning. However, a general
    scheme is that the agent in reinforcement learning tries to maximize the reward
    by a series of interactions with the environment. Each state can be associated
    with a positive or negative reward, and a reward can be defined as accomplishing
    an overall goal, such as winning or losing a game of chess. For instance, in chess
    the outcome of each move can be thought of as a different state of the environment.
    To explore the chess example further, let’s think of visiting certain locations
    on the chess board as being associated with a positive event—for instance, removing
    an opponent’s chess piece from the board or threatening the queen. Other positions,
    however, are associated with a negative event, such as losing a chess piece to
    the opponent in the following turn. Now, not every turn results in the removal
    of a chess piece, and reinforcement learning is concerned with learning the series
    of steps by maximizing a reward based on immediate and delayed feedback.

- en: In supervised learning, we know the right answer beforehand when we train our
    model, and in reinforcement learning, we define a measure of reward for particular
    actions by the agent. In unsupervised learning, however, we are dealing with unlabeled
    data or data of unknown structure. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we
    are able to explore the structure of our data to extract meaningful information
    without the guidance of a known outcome variable or reward function.

- en: '**Clustering** is an exploratory data analysis technique that allows us to
    organize a pile of information into meaningful subgroups (**clusters**) without
    having any prior knowledge of their group memberships. Each cluster that arises
    during the analysis defines a group of objects that share a certain degree of
    similarity but are more dissimilar to objects in other clusters, which is why
    clustering is also sometimes called **unsupervised classification**. Clustering
    is a great technique for structuring information and deriving meaningful relationships
    from data. For example, it allows marketers to discover customer groups based
    on their interests, in order to develop distinct marketing programs.'

- en: Another subfield of unsupervised learning is **dimensionality reduction**. Often
    we are working with data of high dimensionality—each observation comes with a
    high number of measurements—that can present a challenge for limited storage space
    and the computational performance of machine learning algorithms. Unsupervised
    dimensionality reduction is a commonly used approach in feature preprocessing
    to remove noise from data, which can also degrade the predictive performance of
    certain algorithms, and compress the data onto a smaller dimensional subspace
    while retaining most of the relevant information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Sometimes, dimensionality reduction can also be useful for visualizing data,
    for example, a high-dimensional feature set can be projected onto one-, two-,
    or three-dimensional feature spaces in order to visualize it via 3D or 2D scatterplots
    or histograms. The following figure shows an example where nonlinear dimensionality
    reduction was applied to compress a 3D Swiss Roll onto a new 2D feature subspace:'
