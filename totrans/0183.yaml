    to be greater than the other is easy. We may assume that a specific variable or
    data point had more impact on the output, but how sure are we that the other variables
    have an equal impact?

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In statistics, the base rate can be seen as probabilities of classes that are
    unconditional on "featural evidence". You can see the base rate as your prior
    probability assumption.
  prefs: []

- en: Base rates are important tools in research. For example, if we are a pharmaceutical
    company and are in the process of developing and dispatching a new vaccination,
    we want to look into the success of the treatment. If we have 4000 people who
    are willing to take this vaccination, and our base rate is 1/25.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that only 160 people will successfully be cured by the treatment
    out of 4000 people. In the pharmaceutical world, this is a very low success rate.
    This is how base rates can be used to improve research, and accuracy and ensure
    that the product will perform well.

    a mistaken belief or faulty reasoning. If we now combine that with our definition
    of the base rate above.

- en: The base rate fallacy, also known as base rate bias and base rate neglect, is
    the likelihood of judging a specific situation, whilst not taking into consideration
    all relevant data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The base rate fallacy has information about the base rate as well as other relevant
    information. This can be due to various reasons such as not thoroughly examining
    and analyzing the data properly, or ignorance to favour a specific part of the
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The base rate fallacy describes the tendency for someone to disregard the existing
    base rate information, to push and be in favour of the new information. This goes
    against the fundamental rules of evidence-based reasoning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will typically hear about this happening in the financial industry. For
    example, investors will base their buying or sharing tactics on irrational information,
    which leads to fluctuation in the market - despite having the base rate to their
    knowledge.

    What is its relevance and impact in Data Science?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve spoken about ‘probabilities of classes’ and ‘taking into consideration
    all relevant data’. If you are a data scientist, or machine learning engineer,
    or getting your foot in the door - you will know how important probabilities and
    relevant data are to producing accurate outputs, the learning process of your
    machine learning model and producing high-performance models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To analyse and make predictions about data or for your machine learning model
    to produce accurate outputs - you need to take into consideration every bit of
    data. As you’re scanning through your data the first time you see it, you might
    consider some parts relevant and other parts irrelevant. However, this is your
    judgement and is not yet factual till proper analysis has taken place.

    high-performance models. So how can we do this in Data Science?

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you’re going through this article, you can probably think of a variety of
    causes of base rate fallacy, such as not taking all the relevant data into consideration,
    human error, or lack of precision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although these are all true and add to the cause of the base rate fallacy. They
    all relate to the biggest problem of ignoring the base rate information in the
    first place. Base rate information is often ignored as it is considered irrelevant,
    however, the base rate information can save people a lot of time and money. Using
    the base rate information available allows you to be more precise in making probabilities
    about whether a given event will occur.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being aware of fallacies such as opinions, automatic processes, etc - will allow
    you to combat the issue of base rate fallacy and reduce potential errors. When
    you are measuring the probability of a certain event occurring, Bayesian methods
    can help with this to reduce the base rate fallacy.
