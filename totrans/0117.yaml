    and OpenAI - to ensure the safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology.
    These commitments underscore three principles fundamental to the future of AI:
    safety, security, and trust. The companies have agreed to conduct internal and
    external security testing of their AI systems before release, share information
    on managing AI risks, and invest in cybersecurity. They also commit to developing
    technical mechanisms to ensure users know when content is AI-generated and to
    publicly report their AI systems'' capabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate
    and inappropriate use. This move is part of a broader commitment by the Biden-Harris
    Administration to ensure AI is developed safely and responsibly, and to protect
    Americans from harm and discrimination.'

- en: 'Stability AI and its CarperAI lab have announced the launch of Stable Beluga
    1 and Stable Beluga 2, two powerful, open access, Large Language Models (LLMs).
    These models, which demonstrate exceptional reasoning ability across varied benchmarks,
    are based on the original LLaMA 65B and LLaMA 2 70B foundation models respectively.
    Both models were fine-tuned with a new synthetically-generated dataset using Supervised
    Fine-Tune (SFT) in standard Alpaca format. The training for the Stable Beluga
    models was inspired by the methodology used by Microsoft in its paper: "Orca:
    Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4.” Despite training
    on one-tenth the sample size of the original Orca paper, the Stable Beluga models
    demonstrate exceptional performance across various benchmarks. As of July 27th,
    2023, Stable Beluga 2 is the top model on the leaderboard, and Stable Beluga 1
    is fourth.'

    introduction of additional AI-powered functionality to the streaming service.
    Ek suggested that AI could be used to create more personalized experiences, summarize
    podcasts, and generate ads. He highlighted the success of the recently launched
    DJ feature, which delivers a curated selection of music alongside AI-powered commentary
    about the tracks and artists. Ek also mentioned the potential use of generative
    AI to summarize podcasts, making it easier for users to discover new content.
    Furthermore, Ek discussed the possibility of AI-generated audio ads, which could
    significantly reduce the cost for advertisers to develop new ad formats. These
    comments come as Spotify seeks a patent for an AI-powered "text-to-speech synthesis"
    system, which can convert text into human-like speech audio that incorporates
    emotion and intention.

- en: This KDnuggets article introduces the Code Interpreter plugin by ChatGPT, a
    tool that can analyze data, write Python code, and build machine-learning models.
    The author, Natassha Selvaraj, demonstrates how the plugin can be used to automate
    various data science workflows, including data summarization, exploratory data
    analysis, data preprocessing, and building machine-learning models. The Code Interpreter
    can also be used to explain, debug, and optimize code. Natassha emphasizes that
    while the tool is powerful and efficient, it should be used as a baseline for
    data science tasks, as it lacks domain-specific knowledge and cannot handle large
    datasets residing in SQL databases. Natassha suggests that entry-level data scientists
    and those aspiring to become one should learn how to leverage tools like Code
    Interpreter to make their work more efficient.

- en: This KDnuggets article discusses a new approach to AI training proposed by Microsoft
    researchers, which involves using a synthetic textbook instead of massive datasets.
    The researchers trained a model called Phi-1 entirely on a custom-made textbook
    and found that it performed impressively well in Python coding tasks, despite
    being significantly smaller than models like GPT-3\. This suggests that the quality
    of training data can be as important as the size of the model. The Phi-1 model's
    performance also improved when fine-tuned with synthetic exercises and solutions,
    indicating that targeted fine-tuning can enhance a model's capabilities beyond
    the tasks it was specifically trained for. This suggests that this textbook-based
    approach could revolutionize AI training by shifting the focus from creating larger
    models to curating better training data.

    the use of imperfect prompts. The author argues that the pursuit of perfect prompts
    can be counterproductive and that it''s often more practical to aim for "good
    enough" prompts. Generative AI applications use probabilistic and statistical
    methods to parse prompts and generate responses. Therefore, even if the same prompt
    is used multiple times, the AI is likely to produce different responses each time.
    The author suggests that rather than striving for a perfect prompt, users should
    make use of imperfect prompts and aggregate them to create effective prompts.
    The article references a research study titled "Ask Me Anything: A Simple Strategy
    For Prompting Language Models" which proposes a method of turning imperfect prompts
    into robust ones by aggregating the predictions of multiple effective, yet imperfect,
    prompts.'

- en: The research paper titled "The Role of Large Language Models in the Evolution
    of Data Science Education" discusses the transformative impact of Large Language
    Models (LLMs) on the roles and responsibilities of data scientists. The authors
    argue that the rise of LLMs is shifting the focus of data scientists from hands-on
    coding to managing and assessing analyses performed by automated AI systems. This
    shift necessitates a significant evolution in data science education, with a greater
    emphasis on cultivating diverse skillsets among students. These include creativity
    informed by LLMs, critical thinking, programming guided by AI, and interdisciplinary
    knowledge.

- en: The authors also propose that LLMs can play a significant role in the classroom
    as interactive teaching and learning tools. They can contribute to personalized
    education and enrich learning experiences. However, the integration of LLMs into
    education requires careful consideration to balance the benefits of LLMs while
    fostering complementary human expertise and innovation. The paper suggests that
    the future of data science education will likely involve a symbiotic relationship
    between human learners and AI models, where both entities learn from and enhance
    each other's capabilities.
