- en: 'A/B testing, also known as “split testing” or “randomized controlled trial”
    is a method of comparing two versions of a web page, app, or other product to
    see which one performs better. The basic idea of A/B testing is to divide your
    users into two groups: group A and group B. Group A (control variant) sees the
    original version of your product, while group B (test variant) sees a modified
    version with one or more changes. The changes can be anything from the color of
    a button, the layout of a page, the wording of a headline, backend algorithm powering
    your search result or the offer of a promotion. You then measure how each group
    behaves, such as how long users stay on your product, how many pages they visit,
    how many actions they take, or how much revenue they generate. By comparing the
    outcomes of each variant, you can determine which one is more effective at achieving
    your goal. If there are 2 variants it is referred to as A/B test and when there
    are more than 2 variants it is often referred to as A/B/C or A/B/N tests.'

    and your business outcomes. An effective A/B test is one where you feel confident
    in making decisions based on the results. In this article, we will go over the
    basics of A/B testing, how to design and run an effective experiment, and how
    to analyze and interpret the results.

    changing the color of the BUY button would result in improved engagement and higher
    number of units sold. As a Product Manager you have an intuition that changing
    the color to blue would result in higher sales. Sometimes your intuition is correct
    and sometimes it’s wrong. How will you know this? Which is why your goal is to
    gather user insights into how the color of the button would impact user experience
    and key business metrics like revenue.

    to be addressed by an A/B experiment. It should include the current situation,
    the desired outcome, and the gap between them. A well-defined problem statement
    helps to focus the experiment design, align the stakeholders, and measure the
    success of the experiment. Before running an A/B experiment, it is important to
    define the problem statement to avoid wasting resources, time, and effort on irrelevant
    or invalid tests. Depending on the industry the problem statement could differ.

- en: 'To run a successful experiment, you need to collaborate with different teams
    and follow some steps. First, you need to define your key metric, which is a quantitative
    measure that reflects how well you are achieving your goals. For example, if you
    want to test whether changing the color of the buy button on your website affects
    the sales, your key metric would be the revenue per user per month. This metric
    captures the effect of the color change on the user behavior and the business
    outcome. Second, you need to work with the UX team to design two versions of the
    buy button: one with the original color and one with the new color. These are
    called the control variant and the test variant. The UX team can help you ensure
    that the design is consistent, appealing and user-friendly. Third, you need to
    work with the engineering team to implement and deploy the two variants on your
    website. The engineering team can help you ensure that the code is bug-free, secure
    and scalable. Fourth, you need to work with the data team to set up a monitoring
    system that tracks and collects the key metric data from both variants. The data
    team can help you ensure that the data is accurate, reliable and accessible. Fifth,
    you need to decide how to randomize the users who visit your website into either
    the control group or the test group. Randomization is important because it ensures
    that the two groups are statistically similar and that any difference in the key
    metric is due to the color change and not some other factors. You can use different
    methods of randomization, such as cookie-based, user ID-based or IP-based. Sixth,
    you need to determine how many users you need in each group to detect a significant
    difference in the key metric. This is called the sample size and it depends on
    several factors, such as the expected effect size, the standard deviation of the
    key metric, the significance level and the power of the test. You can use a formula
    or a calculator to estimate the sample size based on these factors.'

    a subset of your users and monitor its performance. You should start with a low
    exposure rate and gradually increase it as you gain confidence in your experiment.
    You should also collect data on the key metrics that you defined in your hypothesis
    and track how they change over time. To help you with this, you should partner
    with the Dev team to build a dashboard that displays the metric values and their
    statistical significance. You should avoid peeking at the results and drawing
    premature conclusions before the experiment is over. You should also run your
    experiment for a sufficient duration to ensure that you have enough data to make
    a valid decision. Depending on your traffic volume and conversion rate, this could
    take days, weeks, or months.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you launch any change based on your experiment, you need to perform some
    sanity checks to ensure that your data is reliable and valid. Sanity checks are
    quality control measures that help you detect any errors or anomalies in your
    data collection or analysis process. For example, you can check if the traffic
    allocation was done correctly, if the invariant metrics were consistent across
    the experiment groups, and if there were any external factors that could have
    influenced the results. If you find any issues with your data, you should discard
    it and rerun the experiment with the correct setup.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have verified that your data is trustworthy, you can proceed to launch
    the change. To do this, you need to analyze your results and draw conclusions
    based on your hypothesis and success metrics. You can use statistical methods
    such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and effect size to compare the
    performance of your variations and see if there is a clear winner or a tie. If
    there is a winner, you can implement the winning variation on your website or
    app and end the experiment. If there is a tie, you may need to run another experiment
    with a different hypothesis or a larger sample size to get more conclusive results.
