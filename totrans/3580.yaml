    that spans from the data stage to deployment stage and ensures the success of
    machine learning models. In this post, you will learn about the key stages in
    MLOps (from a data scientist’s perspective) along with some common pitfalls.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MLOps is a practice that focuses on operationalizing data science models. Usually,
    in most enterprises, data scientists are responsible for creating the modeling
    datasets, pre-processing the data, feature engineering, and finally building the
    model. Then the model is “thrown” over the wall to the engineering team to be
    deployed into the API/Endpoint. The science and engineering often times happen
    in silos, which leads to delays in deployment or incorrect deployments in the
    worst case.

    machine learning models into production. For those of us data scientists, the
    finding that ~90% of ML models don’t make it to production, should not come as
    a surprise. MLOps brings the discipline and process to the data science and engineering
    teams to ensure that they collaborate closely and continuously. ***This collaboration
    is crucial to ensure successful model deployment.  ***

    a five key stages that are critical to a successful MLOps strategy. As a side
    note, a crucial element that needs to be a part of each of these stages is communication
    with stakeholders.

    about the “How”. Is machine learning required to tackle this business problem?
    At the onset, it might seem weird that as a data scientist, I am suggesting to
    steer away from machine learning. That’s only because with *“great power comes
    great responsibility”*. Responsibility in this case would be to make sure that
    the machine learning model is built, deployed and monitored carefully to ensure
    that it satisfies and *continues to satisfy* the business requirement. The timelines
    and resources should also be discussed at this stage with the stakeholders.

    of the “Data”. This stage includes steps such as data gathering, data cleaning,
    data transformation, feature engineering and labeling (for supervised learning).
    Here the adage that needs to be remembered is “*garbage in garbage out*”. This
    step is usually the most painstaking step in the process and is critical to ensure
    model success. Ensure to ***validate the data*** and features multiple times to
    make sure that they are aligned with the business problem. Document all your many
    assumptions that you take while creating a dataset. Ex: Are the outliers for a
    feature *actually* outliers?'

    that help expedite this step. Remember to log and track your experiments to ensure
    ***reproducibility*** of your machine learning pipeline.

    needs to be minimized while maximizing throughput.*** Some popular options to
    serve the model are - REST API endpoint, as a docker container on the cloud or
    on an edge device. We can’t yet celebrate once we have deployed the model object,
    as they are very dynamic in nature. For example, the data could drift in production
    causing model decay or there could be adversarial attacks on the model. We need
    to have a robust monitoring infrastructure in place for the machine learning application.

    you are a ***data scientist at a FinTech company in charge of deploying a fraud
    model to detect fraudulent transactions***.
  prefs: []

    third party?) you are trying to detect. How are transactions identified as fraud
    or not? Are they reported by the end user or do you have to use heuristics to
    identify fraud? Who would be consuming the model? Is it going to be used in real
    time or in batch mode? Answers to the above questions are crucial to solving this
    business problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, think about what solution best addresses this problem. Do you need machine
    learning to address this or can you start with a simple heuristic to tackle fraud?
    Is all the fraud coming from a small set of IP addresses?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you decide to build a machine learning model (assume supervised learning
    for this case), you will need labels and features. How will you address missing
    variables? What about outliers? What’s the observation window for fraud labels?
    i.e how long does it take for a user to report a fraud transaction? Is there a
    data warehouse you can use to build features? **Make sure to validate the data
    and features before moving ahead.** This is also a good time to engage with the
    stakeholders about the direction of the project.

    Make sure the model metric is aligned with the business usage. (eg: could be recall
    at the first decile for this use-case). Does the chosen model algorithm satisfy
    the latency requirement?'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, coordinate with engineering to deploy and serve the model. Because fraud
    detection is a very dynamic environment, where fraudsters strive to stay ahead
    of the system, monitoring is very crucial. Have a monitoring plan for both the
    data and the model. Measures such as the PSI (population stability index) are
    common to keep track of data drift. How often will you retrain the model?

    project doesn’t become a tombstone in the data science graveyard! The fact that

    considered right from the beginning and not as an afterthought.
