    users through the analysis process and eventual action to improve the business.
    The goal is not just story telling, but to help user **navigate** from data to
    action.

    that you would place on your executive dashboards. They give people a sense for
    where the key metrics for the business in one place. What are the KPIs that tell
    the current story of the organization?

    reporting we should use bright colors and attention-grabbing icons to **highlight
    changes** in the data.

- en: Every lead KPI and alert needs to be paired with one or more drill-down paths
    to **explore details**. These are supplemental visualizations. The path to do
    drill downs needs to be simple and clearly linked. Ideally each department or
    business process would have its own drill-down area or folder.

- en: Now we’ve got to move beyond just doing a data dump. People want to be led by
    the hand to **recommended routes** to resolve issues. Not every change in every
    chart will have an automatic recommended best route. But many do. If inventory
    is low in a particular SKU, there are just a few routes to follow, so why not
    note them right on the report? If costs are increasing faster than planned in
    one department, do you have standard ways to address the issue? If so, then list
    out those standard actions right where the information is needed and useful as
    the information is consumed.

- en: At the end we need to help users to **take action** by embedding links to the
    associated applications right in the reports. If inventory is low, add a link
    below the KPI to the warehouse management software. If sales are dropping in one
    region, add a link at the bottom of the KPI to Salesforce or your CRM system to
    follow up.
