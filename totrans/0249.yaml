    constantly trying to keep your hand on the pulse, learn new tricks, and at least
    somewhat anticipate the upcoming trends in machine learning.

- en: It’s the most important treasure trove of AI/ML knowledge nowadays. Almost all
    of the papers that come out in the AI world end up here. And it’s no wonder because
    it’s free, comfortable, and it has simple but handy options like categorization
    and sorting. And we just love the resource because you can find simply anything
    here.
  prefs: []

- en: But the AI industry is evolving fast, and the number of new papers and approaches
    is off the charts. Sometimes it's impossible to keep up with the information flow
    because there is an ocean of it. So if you go to this resource, you better do
    it with a specific request.

    Senior Director at Tesla, created **Arxiv-sanity**, a resource where only **the
    most relevant and high-quality papers** end up. It's a kind of filter of goodness.
    And it’s a brilliant idea in the ocean of endless information.
  prefs: []

    For example, the **Top Recent** and **Top Hype** tabs are very convenient and
    practical.
