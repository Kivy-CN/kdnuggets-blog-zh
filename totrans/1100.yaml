    keeps growing stronger. It’s important to have a deep understanding of statistical
    concepts if you want to progress far in your career in data science, and that
    foundation can take a while to build. Springboard’s [Data Science Career Track](https://www.springboard.com/courses/data-science-career-track/?utm_source=kdnuggets&utm_medium=cpm&utm_campaign=dsc&utm_term=december_sponsored_content)
    is a great starting point, and it should be one of the first steps you take if
    you’re serious about building your skills in this area. Let’s take a look at the
    current state of statistics in data science, and what you can do to accelerate
    your learning.

    layers, and while that may be an exaggeration, there is still [some truth to the
    statement](https://www.displayr.com/statistics-vs-data-science-whats-the-difference/).
    And that extends to the general field of data science. Working with data, identifying
    patterns in it and predicting trends in future data sets, all boil down to applying
    various statistical techniques correctly. This is made easier with the help of
    modern digital solutions, which can churn through large volumes of data at a fast
    rate.

- en: For most people, a good foundation in statistics will go a long way towards
    becoming a data scientist, even without digging deep into any particular subfield.
    You need to generally develop the ability to think like a statistician, and apply
    appropriate reasoning methods to the situations you encounter. This will help
    you much more than learning any specific tightly specialized fields of statistics.
  prefs: []

- en: What’s more, you need to develop the ability to understand what you’re doing,
    and how you’ve come to your conclusions. A large part of data science is a black
    box, especially when artificial intelligence is involved. This can make it deceptively
    easy to just apply a bunch of pre-made models to a situation, get some results,
    and call it a day.

    that point, you’re not going to be taken seriously by experts in the field. This
    will also help you understand the limits of the problems you encounter. You may
    not immediately know what the right solution is, but understanding the limits
    of the domain will at least help you steer your attention in the right direction.

- en: There are some basic models that you should go through in your learning in any
    case, no matter what you’ve chosen to focus on in particular. Implementing those
    from scratch with your own resources and research will go a long way towards gaining
    a deeper understanding of how the field works, and how different concepts are
    connected in it.

    That’s one of the easiest concepts to understand in statistics and data science,
    and will open the doors to some additional areas that might interest you. Do a
    naive Bayes classifier. There are lots of resources on the subject online, and
    it should be another relatively easy task to go through, while still providing
    you with a lot of valuable knowledge about the fundamentals of statistics in data
    science.

    the in-depth knowledge you need in order to understand the concepts that follow.
    There are various places to learn statistics for data science, and you should
    take your time to compare some of the most popular courses out there.

- en: Some useful books that can get you stated on the right track include “Practical
    Statistics for Data Scientists” by Peter Bruce and Andrew Bruce; “Bayesian Methods
    for Hackers” by Cameron Davidson-Pilon; and “Computer Age Statistical Inference”
    by Bradley Efron and Trevor Hastie. Those are easy to find and quite popular in
    the community, so you should have lots of opportunities to discuss what you’ve
    learned with others.

    in the latter field without putting in some effort in the former. At the same
    time, the level of understanding you’re going to need to progress far in data
    science isn’t as high as you might expect. For many people, going over the basic
    concepts that we outlined above, and completing a few training courses, should
    be more than enough to get them started and introduce the area in a comprehensive
    manner.

    if you’re interested in pursuing a career in data science. It will give you one
    of the most in-depth overviews of the field you can find right now, and will help
    you understand the concepts you need to take your skills to the next level. Talk
    to as many people as you can, too – data science is going through lots of active
    developments right now, and it’s a great time to discuss recent findings with
    other specialists.
