    that mathematical knowledge is something we do not need. Data scientists need
    to learn and understand the mathematical theory behind machine learning to efficiently
    solving business problems.

- en: The mathematics behind machine learning is not just a random notation thrown
    here and there, but it consists of many theories and thoughts. This thought creates
    a lot of mathematical laws that contribute to the machine learning we can use
    right now. Although you could use the mathematics in any way you want to solve
    the problem, mathematical laws are not limited to machine learning after all.

    that could help you as a Data Scientist. Let’s get into it.

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Benford’s law, also called the **Newcomb–Benford law**, the **law of anomalous
    numbers**, or the **first-digit law, **is a mathematical law about the leading
    digit number in a real-world dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we think about the first digit of the numbers, it should be distributed
    uniformly when we randomly took a number. Intuitively, the random number leading
    digit 1 should have the same probability as leading digit 9, which is ~11.1%.
    Surprisingly, this is not what happens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Benford’s law states that the leading digit is likely to be small in many
    naturally occurring collections of numbers**. A leading digit of 1 happens more
    often than 2, a leading digit of 2 occurs more often than 3, and so on.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s try using a real-world dataset to see how this law is applicable. For
    this article, I use the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) regarding
    Spotify Track songs from 1921–2020\. From the data, I take the leading digit of
    the song durations.

    it is decreasing following the higher number. This is what Benford’s Law state
    above.

    is said to satisfy Benford’s law if the leading digit *d* (???? ∈ 1, …, 9) occurs
    with the equation,

    to occur more than the other leading digit.

    forms, election results, economic numbers, and accounting figures.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials of a random process
    increases, the results' average get closer to the expected values or theoretical
    values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, when rolling dice, the possibilities for a 6-sided die are 1, 2,
    3, 4, 5, and 6\. The mean for the 6-side dice would be 3.5\. As we roll the die,
    the number we get is random from 1 to 6, but as we keep rolling the dice, the
    results' average get closer to the expected value, which is 3.5\. This is what
    the Law of Large Numbers denote.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it is useful, but the tricky part here is that you need many experiments
    or occurrences. However, having a large number required means that it is good
    for predicting long-term stability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Law of Large Numbers is different than the Law of Averages used to express
    a belief that outcomes of a random event will “even out” within a small sample.
    This is what we called “**Gambler’s Fallacy**,” where we expect the expected value
    occurs in a smaller sample.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zipf’s law was created for quantitative linguistics and states that given some
    natural language dataset corpus, any word's frequency** is inversely proportional
    to its frequency table rank**. Thus the most frequent word occurs approximately
    twice as often as the second most frequent word and three times as often as the
    third most frequent word.

    to count them. Below is the top 12 of the most common words and their frequency.

- en: When I sum all the words that exist in the Spotify corpus, the total is 759,389\.
    We can see if Zipf’s law applies to this dataset by counting the probabilities
    when they occur. The first most occurring word or punctuation is ‘-’ with 32,258,
    which has the probability of ~4%, followed by ‘the,’ which has the probability
    of ~2%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Faithful to the law, the probability keeps going down in some of the words.
    Of course, there is a little deviation, but the probability goes down most of
    the time following the frequency rank increase.
