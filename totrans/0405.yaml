    They want to evaluate your work experience, technical knowledge, and logical thinking.
    Furthermore, they are looking for data scientists who understand both the business
    and technical sides.

    asked to come up with a new data science product. I suggested an open-source solution
    and let the community contribute to the project. I explained my thought process
    and how we can monetize the product by providing premium service to paid customers.

    in dealing with complex projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    challenging and how you overcame it. It is all about details, tools, methodologies,
    terminology, out-of-box thinking, and dedication.

    interview. It will prepare you for the talking points, business use case, tools, 
    and data science methodologies.

    the business needs or not?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is not a complete question and it can put off the interviewee. You need to
    ask for a business use case and additional information about the baseline metric.
    After that, you can start with analyzing data and business use cases. You will
    be explaining statistical algorithms to analyze data reliability and quality.
    After that, match it with the business use case and how it can improve existing
    systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    preparedness for handling random datasets. Explain your thought process and come
    up with a conclusion.

    how machine learning has generated revenue for multiple companies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tackle this question. Machine learning is used in forecasting stock prices, diagnosing
    diseases, multi-language customer service, and recommended systems in e-commerce.

    two variables, A and B. It is mostly used for user experience research where two
    different versions of a product are analyzed based on user response.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Markov Chains is a transition from one state to another using probabilistic
    methodology. It defines the probability of transitioning to a future state based
    on the current state and time elapsed. Markov Chain is used in information theory,
    search engines, and speech recognition. Learn more by reading [Brilliant Math’s](https://brilliant.org/wiki/markov-chains/)

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simple solution is to drop outliers as they affect the overall data analysis.
    But before you do that, make sure your dataset is large, and the values you are
    removing are garbage. The garbage means that it was added by mistake.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency of records) is used to calculate
    the relevance of a word in a series or corpus of a text. During the text indexing
    process, it assesses the value of each term in a document or corpus. It is commonly
    used for text vectorization, where a line or sentence is converted to numerical
    values and used for NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    If you have multiple local optima, its convergence depends on the data and initial
    conditions. It is hard to reach global minima.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sliding window method is also called the lag method, where previous time
    steps are used as inputs, and the next time step is used as an output. The previous
    steps depend on the **window width**, which is the number of previous steps. The
    sliding window method is quite famous for univariate forecasting. It converts
    a time series dataset into a supervised learning problem.
