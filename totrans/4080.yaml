    of non-repeating and immutable elements. You can perform common operations from
    set theory such as union, intersection, and set difference on Python sets.

    learn how to use the built-in set method  difference() and - operator to find
    the set difference, and how to debug common errors during the process.

    difference operation.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in set A but not in set B.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Set difference is *not* a commutative operation. Therefore, A - B is not the
    same as A - B unless the sets A and B are equal, that is, A and B contain the
    same elements.

- en: In the examples we have coded so far, we computed the difference between two
    Python sets. But did not emphasize how the `difference()` method works differently
    than the difference operator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can call the `difference()` method on any valid set object. However, you
    can pass in one or more sets or other Python iterables. Here’s an example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let’s define `set1`, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE5]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Now we can call the `difference()` method on the `set1` and pass in `list1`,
    `list2`, and `list3` in the method call.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE6]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The difference method, in this case, returns the elements {1,5} from the set
    that are present only in `set1` and not in `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.

- en: 'However, if you try doing the same thing with the difference operator, you
    will run into a `TypeError` exception. As - is a binary operator that operates

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us quickly review what we’ve learned in this tutorial. To find the set difference,
    we can use either the `difference()` method on a Python set or the - operator.
    While the `difference()` method call acts on a set and takes in one or more Python
    iterables as the arguments, the - operator lets you perform set difference operation
    between two Python sets *only*. If you’re looking to learn Python, check out this
