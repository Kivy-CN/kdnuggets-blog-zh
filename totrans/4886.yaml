- en: For many good reasons, much of the highest quality machine learning educational
    resources tend to have a very strong focus on theory, especially at the beginning.
    There seems, however, to be an increasing trend of getting on to the practical
    from the start, and mixing practice and theory along the way as resources progress.
    This post presents 5 such resources.

    scratch and using particular deep learning frameworks, these resources cover quite
    a bit of ground. They are also all free, so get reading, get watching, and get
    coding.

    learning algorithms with Python libraries. It also covers some data cleaning and
    manipulation with Pandas, ax well as some data visualization with a few libraries,
    before getting into modeling.

- en: Moving on from using existing libraries to implementing machine learning models,
    this Github repository holds Python implementations of a number of machine learning
    algorithms from scratch (hence the name). While not industrial grade, and lacking
    much of the coherence, optimization, and convenience of polished libraries like
    Scikit-learn, these implementations are easy to follow, and are meant as a great
    set of learning materials when wanting to either implement your own algorithms
    or learn better how they function.

    learning, Apache MXNet (incubating), and the gluon interface. Our goal is to leverage
    the strengths of Jupyter notebooks to present prose, graphics, equations, and
    code together in one place. If we’re successful, the result will be a resource
    that could be simultaneously a book, course material, a prop for live tutorials,
    and a resource for plagiarising (with our blessing) useful code.
