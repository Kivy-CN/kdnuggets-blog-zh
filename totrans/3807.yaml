- en: You've already met ChatGPT, the advanced language model designed by OpenAI that
    uses machine learning to understand natural language and generate human-like responses.
    It possesses a vast knowledge base, and with its sophisticated "understanding"
    of language is able to act as a powerful sidekick for anyone on the hunt for information.
    It can answer a wide range of questions, provide advice, engage in conversation
    on various topics, and has proven itself in a vast number of areas.
