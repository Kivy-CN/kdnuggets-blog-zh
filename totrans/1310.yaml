    about Python and C++ the hard way as well as how to write a clean code properly.

    specialization is literally called *‘What is Data Science?’*. I mean, you won’t
    get any more basic than this, right?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of data science before delving into programming stuff with Python and SQL. Next,
    it introduces you to the meat of data science — Statistics, Data Analysis, Data
    Visualization, and Machine Learning.

    for Big Data analysis. In total, there are 3 courses in this specialization.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we already know, the amount of data nowadays is just too big to be stored
    in traditional DBMS, hence knowledge and hands-on experience in dealing with data
    in distributed clusters are very important. And this course will teach you exactly
    that.
  prefs: []

    Virtual Machine from Cloudera, we have a chance to apply SQL query to retrieve
    or to store data with either Apache Hive, Apache Impala, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
    You can always revisit the Virtual Machine even after you finished the specialization,
    so you will always able to revise your SQL skills and play around with the data.

    a simple regression or classification machine learning model directly in BigQuery.

    interactive data visualization dashboard and story with Tableau.
