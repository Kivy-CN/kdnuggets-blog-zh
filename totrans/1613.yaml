- en: Many recent articles have highlighted the shortage of women and underrepresented
    minorities in the tech industry, as well as problems associated with the “Bro
    Culture” of Silicon Valley. However, few articles have offered suggestions other
    than hiring practices as a way to increase diversity. Just how dire is this problem,
    and what can be done about it, other than suggesting a cultural change initiated
    by teams that are largely comprised of the exact same backgrounds?

    sixth is underrepresented minorities (Hispanic or African American). Management
    is approximately five sixths Caucasian. Large tech companies such as Google or
    Apple report even less diversity among their workforces, and within tech-specific
    positions, the industry is 24% women and 5% underrepresented minorities. On development
    teams, women make up as few as 13% of roles, and women in technical positions
    are twice as likely to leave a position as men. These statistics suggest that
    women and underrepresented minorities are in jobs not related to technical development
    or leadership in tech companies.

- en: Companies can benefit in many ways from increased diversity. A recent report
    from McKinsey suggests that the top quarter of companies with respect to racial
    and ethnic diversity enjoy a 35% boost in likelihood of exceeding industry median
    returns compared to baseline rates. Having a female in an executive position boosted
    return rates for the Standard & Poor 1500 companies’ revenue by $42 million. This
    suggests an opportunity for boosted revenue through hiring a diverse tech team
    and a diverse executive team. In addition, the experiences women and minorities
    bring to tech teams can aid in design and cover potential blind spots in user
    experience and product development.

- en: However, addressing this issue is more complex than simply changing hiring practices.
    Women and underrepresented minorities make up disproportionately small fraction
    of the educational pipeline associated with tech positions; the number of women
    graduating with computer science degrees continues to fall (from 37% in 1984 to
    18% in 2014). Given the ubiquity and ease of online training programs and MOOCs
    these days, it would be easy to assume that those opportunities bridge the gap.
    However, data science programs/bootcamps lag in female participation (35% of participants
    are women) and in underrepresented minority participation (4% African-American
    and 8% Hispanic), as well. With low diversity in academic programs and industry
    bootcamps, the tech position figures are unlikely that the trend will change in
    the near future. Even reductions in discrimination may not help if young students
    do not see anyone who looks like them or comes from the same socioeconomic background
    within a classroom.

- en: Educators, bootcamp directors, and the tech industry itself can address these
    disparities, though, and several initiatives are likely to boost numbers in the
    coming years. Many scholarships exist for women in tech bootcamps ([https://www.switchup.org/blog/women-in-tech-a-comprehensive-scholarship-guide](https://www.switchup.org/blog/women-in-tech-a-comprehensive-scholarship-guide))
    and academic programs ([https://www.scholarshipsforwomen.net/engineering/](https://www.scholarshipsforwomen.net/engineering/)),
    as well as African-American and Hispanic students ([http://www.nacme.org/](http://www.nacme.org/)).
    The US has also promised $200 million of STEM education funding to women and minorities
    in the coming years. This can help with affordability issues, as well as serve
    as an incentive for women and underrepresented minorities to try a tech-related
    major or bootcamp.

    underrepresented minorities in founder or leadership positions ([https://startupnation.com/start-your-business/small-business-grants-women-minorities/](https://startupnation.com/start-your-business/small-business-grants-women-minorities/),

    helping to increase diversity at the higher levels of start-ups. Before starting
    my side consulting LLC, I was not aware of the types of funding available to start
    a small business, and it is possible that women and underrepresented minorities
    who have thought of starting a business are unaware of the funding available to
    do so.

- en: Industry conferences offer another opportunity to encourage women and minorities
    to pursue tech positions and career growth. Stanford’s Women in Data Science (WiDS)
    conference surpassed 100,000 attendees in hundreds of cities this past March,
    and this has allowed women to present their work to other women and to the men
    who attend the conference. Creating a conference similar to WiDS that highlights
    the tech-based accomplishments and work of African-Americans and Hispanics or
    those who came from low-income families might create similar visibility within
    the larger community that portrays tech as a viable career choice.

- en: My own path into the tech industry involved three professors—one in an introductory
    calculus course and two during graduate school—who were successful women in mathematics,
    and my first roles within the industry were for companies with involved female
    leaders. Without an opportunity to learn from these women, I’m not sure I would
    have seen leadership or technical roles as a good fit for me. Creating visibility
    of women and minorities in technical education/programs, particularly early on,
    and making those opportunities financially viable through scholarship and grant
    programs can increase diversity at all stages of a technical career.

- en: Visibility of role models and resources may be more effective at increasing
    tech diversity (and STEM diversity in general) than hiring guidelines and other
    equality measures. Campaigns like the UK-based WISE initiative, which focuses
    on helping and encouraging young women to pursue STEM careers after age 16, and
    Miami’s Women in Biomedical Science Initiative may be one route to achieving this.
    More conferences like WiDS can also aid in the visibility effort. With visible
    leadership by women and minorities in the field, wider knowledge of opportunities
    and funding available, and programs that connect a new generation of potential
    tech workers with those further along in their careers.
