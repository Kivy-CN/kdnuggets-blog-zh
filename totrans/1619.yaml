    The difference between a statistician and a machine learning engineer is not that
    one uses R and the other uses Python. The SQL vs R vs Python taxonomy is ill-advised
    for so many reasons, not least of which is that software evolves. (As of recently,
    you can even do [ML in SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigqueryml-intro).)

    great news is that this one is easy. Think of your dataset as a bunch of negatives
    you found in a darkroom. Data-mining is about working the equipment to expose
    all the images as quickly as possible so you can see whether there’s anything
    inspiring on them. As with photos, remember not to take what you see too seriously.
    You didn’t take the photos, so you don’t know much about what’s off-screen. The
    golden rule of data-mining is: **stick to what is here.** Only make conclusions
    about what you can see, never about what you can’t see (for that you need statistics
    and lot more expertise).
