    positions. In fact, according to [this](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/why-sql-is-the-most-important-language-to-learn/)
    2021 analysis, SQL was the most in-demand technical skill for data jobs, followed
    by Python and machine learning.

- en: Yet, data science courses and boot camps don’t emphasize teaching students to
    deal with large amounts of data. The focus area of most data science learning
    material is on predictive modeling, and candidates who complete these programs
    are left without the ability to query and manipulate databases.

- en: When I started my first data science internship, I was excited to start building
    machine learning algorithms during my first day. However, the task I was given
    was completely different from what I’d expected. I had to query data from a database,
    clean it, and perform an analysis to answer a business question.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After my first week at the company, I realized that many business use-cases
    in organizations didn’t even require predictive modeling to solve. Often, a simple
    SQL query sufficed to filter and aggregate data according to the stakeholder’s
    requirement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wasn’t able to perform these tasks as quickly as my co-workers initially,
    and spent more time on data extraction and pre-processing since I was unfamiliar
    with SQL. Luckily, as this was just an internship, expectations weren’t too high,
    and I was able to improve my querying skills as I went on.

- en: The biggest piece of advice I can give aspiring data scientists is to learn
    SQL. This is an often-overlooked skill by most data science learning providers
    but is arguably as important as machine learning modeling.

- en: Even for tasks that require you to build a fancy predictive algorithm, knowledge
    of SQL is a must. Data pipelines in most organizations are stored in the form
    of relational databases, and you need to pull data from these databases and pre-process
    it before you can even begin to build ML models.

    diagram used to visualize the tables in a database and the relationship between
    them. As a data scientist, when extracting data from different tables, you’d often
    need to refer to an ER Diagram to understand how the tables interact with each
    other.

    recommend following along to these tutorials by W3Schools to learn the following
    commands — [SELECT](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select.asp), [IN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_in.asp),
    [WHERE](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp), [BETWEEN](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp),

    tables. Once you’re familiar with them, start learning [CASE](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp)
    statements. They’re very similar to if-else commands in any programming language.
