    Even if you improve the model, it fails miserably in production for unknown reasons.
    If you are struggling with similar problems, then you are at the right place.

- en: In this blog, I will share 7 tips on making your model accurate and stable.
    By following these tips, you can be sure that your model will perform better even
    on unseen data.

- en: Why should you listen to my advice? I have been in this field for almost four
    years, participating in 80+ machine running competitions and working on several
    end-to-end machine learning projects. I have also helped many experts build better
    and more reliable models for years.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cleaning the data is the most essential part. You need to fill in missing values,
    deal with outliers, standardize the data, and ensure data validity. Sometimes,
    cleaning through a Python script doesn't really work. You have to look at each
    and every sample one by one to ensure there are no issues. I know it will take
    a lot of your time, but trust me, cleaning the data is the most important part
    of the machine learning ecosystem.

    multiple issues in the dataset that could not be solved by simply removing characters.
    I had to listen to the audio and rewrite the accurate transcription. There were
    some transcriptions that were quite vague and did not make sense.

- en: 2\. Add More Data
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Increasing the volume of data can often lead to improved model performance.
    Adding more relevant and diverse data to the training set can help the model learn
    more patterns and make better predictions. If your model lacks diversity, it may
    perform well on the majority class but poorly on the minority class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many data scientists are now using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to
    generate more diverse datasets. They achieve this by training the GAN model on
    existing data and then using it to generate a synthetic dataset.

- en: 3\. Feature Engineering
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing data and also
    removing unnecessary features that contribute less to the model's decision-making.
    This provides the model with more relevant information to make predictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to perform SHAP analysis, look at feature importance analysis, and
    determine which features are important to the decision-making process. Then, they
    can be used to create new features and remove irrelevant ones from the dataset.
    This process requires a thorough understanding of the business use case and each
    feature in detail. If you don't understand the features and how they are useful
    for the business, you will be walking down the road blindly.

- en: 4\. Cross-Validation
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess a model's performance across
    multiple subsets of data, reducing overfitting risks and providing a more reliable
    estimate of its ability to generalize. This will provide you with the information
    if your model is stable enough or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Calculating the accuracy on the entire testing set may not provide complete
    information about your model's performance. For instance, the first fifth of the
    testing set might show 100% accuracy, while the second fifth could perform poorly
    with only 50% accuracy. Despite this, the overall accuracy might still be around
    85%. This discrepancy indicates that the model is unstable and requires more clean
    and diverse data for retraining.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, instead of performing a simple model evaluation, I recommend using cross-validation
    and providing it with various metrics you want to test the model on.

- en: 5\. Hyperparameter Optimization
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Training the model with default parameters might seem simple and fast, but you
    are missing out on improved performance, as in most cases your model is not optimized.
    To increase the performance of your model during testing, it is highly recommended
    to thoroughly perform hyperparameter optimization on machine learning algorithms,
    and save those parameters so that next time you can use them for training or retraining
    your models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting external configurations to optimize
    model performance. Finding the right balance between overfitting and underfitting
    is crucial for improving the model's accuracy and reliability. It can sometimes
    improve the accuracy of the model from 85% to 92%, which is quite significant
    in the machine learning field.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model selection and experimenting with various algorithms is crucial to finding
    the best fit for the given data. Do not restrict yourself to only simple algorithms
    for tabular data. If your data has multiple features and 10 thousand samples,
    then you should consider neural networks. Sometimes, even logistic regression
    can provide amazing results for text classification that cannot be achieved through
    deep learning models like LSTM.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Start with simple algorithms and then slowly experiment with advanced algorithms
    to achieve even better performance.

- en: 7\. Ensembling
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensemble learning involves combining multiple models to improve overall predictive
    performance. Building an ensemble of models, each with its own strengths, can
    lead to more stable and accurate models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensembling the models has often given me improved results, sometimes leading
    to a top 10 position in machine learning competitions. Don't discard low-performing
    models; combine them with a group of high-performing models, and your overall
    accuracy will increase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensembling, cleaning the dataset, and feature engineering have been my three
    best strategies for winning competitions and achieving high performance, even
    on unseen datasets.

- en: There are more tips that only work for certain types of machine learning fields.
    For instance, in computer vision, we need to focus on image augmentation, model
    architecture, preprocessing techniques, and transfer learning. However, the seven
    tips discussed above—cleaning the data, adding more data, feature engineering,
    cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, experimenting with different algorithms,
    and ensembling—are universally applicable and beneficial for all machine learning
    models. By implementing these strategies, you can significantly enhance the accuracy,
    reliability, and robustness of your predictive models, leading to better insights
    and more informed decision-making.
