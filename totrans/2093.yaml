- en: Large Language Models are advanced types of artificial intelligence designed
    to understand and generate human-like text. They are built using machine learning
    techniques, specifically deep learning. Essentially, LLMs are trained on vast
    amounts of text data from the Internet, books, articles, and other sources to
    learn the patterns and structures of human language.

    models. Still, a significant milestone was the introduction of the Transformer
    architecture by [Vaswani et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762). in 2017, detailed
    in the paper "[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)."

    In [2018, OpenAI released GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)](https://openai.com/index/language-unsupervised/),
    which marked the beginning of highly capable LLMs. The subsequent release of GPT-2
    in 2019, with 1.5 billion parameters, demonstrated unprecedented text generation
    abilities and raised ethical concerns due to its potential misuse. GPT-3, launched
    in June 2020, with 175 billion parameters, further showcased the power of LLMs,
    enabling a wide range of applications from creative writing to programming assistance.
    More recently, [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-research/), released
    in 2023, continued this trend, offering even greater capabilities, although specific
    details about its size and data remain proprietary.

    the human brain. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
    Neural networks process and learn from data by adjusting the connections (weights)
    between neurons based on the input they receive. This adjustment process is called
    training.

    You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)" by Vaswani et al., revolutionized
    natural language processing (NLP). Transformers use an attention mechanism that
    enables the model to focus on different parts of the input text, understanding
    context better than previous models. Transformers consist of encoder and decoder
    layers. The encoder processes the input text, and the decoder generates the output
    text.

    by considering the context that precedes it. This involves assigning probability
    scores to tokenized words, broken into more minor character sequences, and transforming
    them into embeddings, numerical representations of context. LLMs are trained on
    massive text corpora to ensure accuracy, enabling them to grasp grammar, semantics,
    and conceptual relationships through zero-shot and self-supervised learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once trained, LLMs autonomously generate text by predicting the next word based
    on received input and drawing from their acquired patterns and knowledge. This
    results in coherent and contextually relevant language generation that is useful
    for various Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and content generation tasks.

    fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to mitigate
    biases, hateful speech, and factually incorrect responses termed "**hallucinations**"
    that may arise from training on vast unstructured data. This aspect is crucial
    in ensuring the readiness of enterprise-grade LLMs for safe and effective use,
    safeguarding organizations from potential liabilities and reputational harm.
