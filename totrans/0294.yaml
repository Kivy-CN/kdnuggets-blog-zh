    need to have a strong portfolio. This means you need to show the recruiters that
    you can build AI models and applications that solve real-world problems.

    on Hugging Face spaces. It is a beginner-friendly AI project that requires minimal
    knowledge of language models and Python. First, you will learn various components
    of the Gradio Python library to build a chatbot application, and then you will
    use the Hugging Face ecosystem to load the model and deploy it.

    application and also as an SQL query engine using the LlamaIndex framework. The
    query will take natural language input, convert it into SQL, and display the result
    in natural language. It is a simple and straightforward project for beginners,
    but before you dive into building the AI application, you need to learn a few
    basics of the DuckDB Python API and the LlamaIndex framework.

    AI applications. In this project, we will explore the various features of Cohere
    API and learn to create a multi-step AI agent using the LangChain ecosystem and
    the Command R+ model. This AI application will take the user's query, search the
    web using the Tavily API, generate Python code, execute the code using Python
    REPL, and then return the visualization requested by the user. This is an intermediate-level
    project for individuals with basic knowledge and interested in building advanced
    AI applications using the LangChain framework.

    resources and convert the model to Llama.cpp format so that it can be used locally
    on your laptop without the internet. You will first learn to fine-tune the Llama-3
    model on a medical dataset, then merge the adapter with the base model and push
    the full model to the Hugging Face Hub. After that, convert the model files into
    the Llama.cpp GGUF format, quantize the GGUF model and push the file to Hugging
    Face Hub. Finally, use the fine-tuned model locally with the Jan application.

    month. I fine-tuned the Wave2Vec2 Large model on an Urdu dataset using the Transformer
    library. After that, I improved the results of the generated output by integrating
    the language model.

    language and integrate it with a language model to improve its performance. After
    that, you will use Gradio to build an AI application and deploy it to the Hugging
    Face server. Fine-tuning is a challenging task that requires learning the basics,
    cleaning the audio and text dataset, and optimizing the model training.

    when new data is pushed or code is updated. It will use new data to retrain the
    model, generate model evaluations, pull the trained model, and deploy it on the
    server. It is a fully automated system that generates logs at every step.
