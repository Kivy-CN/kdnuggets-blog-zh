    you were given an introduction to ultralearning and an effective strategy for
    implementing metalearning. With that, you can begin your voyage into the journey
    of ultralearning data science.

    is full of distractions. We live in a time where our attention is cheaply sold
    and the concept of the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) is
    treating our attention as a valuable currency.

    it, *focus*. Modern life is full of distractions, from constant notifications
    on your phone to the inclination to binge YouTube and Netflix, our attention span
    has decreased substantially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These distractions can be detrimental to a person’s wellbeing and aptness to
    work productively. Finding your focus in this distraction-laden and attention-sapping
    world is akin to finding a needle in a haystack.

    finding your focus, and reach your ultralearning goals!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initial challenge to finding your focus is most definitely *getting focused
    in the first place*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a lot of ways to do this, as we all have our ways to trick ourselves
    to sit down and start grinding on a personal project or writing an article.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One example of this is setting a timer for five minutes. First, you promise
    yourself that you can stop working after those five minutes. This impetus provided
    by the promise that you stop in a short amount of time will usually keep a person
    going and continue working.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This strategy of tricking yourself is parallel to the prominent *Pomodoro technique*:
    set a [timer](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) for 25 minutes and work without any
    distractions whatsoever, and without stopping. When the timer goes off, you take
    a five-minute break. Then, go back to another 25 minutes after that.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This self-created sense of urgency and rewarding oneself with breaks in between
    focused work is particularly useful and is proven to be very productive. As the
    amount of focused work increases, the duration of breaks will also increase proportionally
    (five minutes to 10/15 minutes).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conversely, some would prefer to continue after the 25 minutes of focused work
    as it has already given you the momentum to keep on working, and then only take
    a break after an hour.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This alternative is called the*52/17 technique*. It has recently gained popularity
    and is even titled as the ideal productivity schedule. Thus, according to your
    preferences and ability, you can tweak this Pomodoro technique and start obtaining
    focus.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After finding your focus, the next trial is sustaining it. This is one of the
    hardest parts of focused work as we humans have been conditioned by the internet
    and social media to have shorter attention spans.
  prefs: []

    environment and not let it control you, you have to take the initiative to eliminate
    these distractions.

    of attaining focus. But the trial doesn’t end there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though you may have started building a logistic regression prediction model
    from scratch by following a step-by-step tutorial on YouTube, and you think you’re
    learning a lot, but it could be that you have slipped into autopilot mode.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Try building another model without any video tutorials at all, are you able
    to do it? If not, you were not fully engaged in the learning process, you were
    merely inputting new material, without retaining it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To combat autopilot, apply *interleaving* — the deliberate alternation between
    materials and modes of learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, to ensure retention of new concepts, you have to interleave by tackling
    your data science project in *short, regularly spaced sessions.* Say, if you have
    10 hours in your week to devote to learning about Python, aim for five two-hour
    sessions every week rather than one ten-hour session in one day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In each session, plan what you will learn beforehand, such as data visualization
    on Monday, data cleaning on Tuesday, statistics and probability on Wednesday,
    etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, plan the resources you will use to learn and have a structure for
    learning, starting from knowledge building (books and articles), then only to
    application (writing code in an IDE).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To achieve this interleaving methodology effectively, one can utilize the concept
    of [*timeboxing*](https://hbr.org/2018/12/how-timeboxing-works-and-why-it-will-make-you-more-productive)—
    a term that comes from agile software development, in which a time box is a *defined* period
    during which a task must be accomplished.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With timeboxing, only a limited amount of time (timebox) is given to complete
    one task, after the time has ended, you move forward to the next one, even if
    the task before is not complete. This ensures productive work and prevents an
    individual from spending too much time on one particular task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you are having trouble debugging Python code for your project,
    and you’ve spent hours on Stack Overflow, Reddit, YouTube, and Discord, but you
    still have not solved it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the end, all you did the entire day was debugging, and you’ve completely
    neglected other plans. To prepare for situations like this (common in programming),
    give debugging code about 15–20 minutes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This way, you can still continue on to other things instead of spending the
    entire day fixing your code.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last step is to make the most of your deep work sessions by noting down
    your *mental arousals* — your level of energy and alertness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We all have certain times where our ability to focus peaks. To engage in productive
    work, one has to note down their idiosyncratic times where they perform at their
    best.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be illustrated by the night-owls and early birds kinds of people, one
    is more creative and productive at midnight, while the other works best early
    in the morning, before the sun rises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to find your mental power peaks is to journal your day before you sleep
    and takedown at which point of the day you were very effective. Do this for one
    month and look back at the times where you were productive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Voila! You have your collection of time intervals where you are focused.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With that, you then allocate tasks according to your arousal levels.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*High arousals* generate intense but narrow focus — suitable for repetitive
    tasks, like finding resources for learning about data science and organizing them
    in applications such as Notion, Trello, GitHub, etc. and researching to solve
    business problems for a company'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Low arousals* generate a relaxed but wider type of focus, perfect for lateral
    thinking and forming new connections such as brainstorming a fun data science
    project or asking the right questions when solving a problem.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By matching your tasks to your arousal levels, you can perform simple tasks
    when your focus is aroused and complex tasks when it’s less aroused — for the
    optimum ultralearning results.
