    of a population using data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Bayesian inference** takes into consideration prior knowledge, and the parameter
    is taken as a random variable. Meaning there is a probability that the event will
    occur. For example, if we were to flip a coin, Bayesian inference will state that
    there is no wrong or right answer, and the probability of the coin landing on
    heads or tails is down to their perspective.'

- en: People that have a Bayesian mindset, view and use probabilities to measure the
    likelihood of an event happening. It is what they believe. The probability of
    a hypothesis is calculated and deemed true using prior opinions and knowledge
    as new data is readily available. This is called prior probability, which is concluded
    before the project starts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    once the project has started.

- en: What is the Frequentist Approach?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Frequentist inference** is different. It assumes that events are based on
    frequencies, and the parameter is not a random variable- meaning there is no probability.
    Using the same example as above, if you were to flip a coin - frequentist inference
    will state that there is a correct answer based on frequency. If you were to toss
    a coin and get tails half of the time, then the probability of getting tails is
    50%.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a stopping criterion put in place. The stopping rule determines the
    sample space, therefore knowledge about it is essential for frequentist inference.
    For example, with the coin toss a frequentist approach may repeat the test 2000
    times, or until it's landed on 300 tails. Researchers don’t typically repeat tests
    this amount of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People that have a Frequentist mindset, view and treat probability the same
    as frequencies. Their probability depends on something happening if it were to
    be infinitely repeated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a frequentist's point of view, the parameters you use to estimate your
    population are assumed to be fixed. There’s a single true parameter that you will
    estimate and is not modeled as a probability distribution. When new data is available,
    you will use it to perform statistical tests and make probabilities about the
    data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most popular computation in frequentist statistics is the p-value, a statistical
    measurement used to validate your hypotheses. It describes how likely you are
    to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis (no statistical
    relationship) is correct.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statistics is a huge part of Data Science, and if you’re part of that world
    - you have come across Bayes’ Theorem, p-value, and other statistical tests. It
    benefits you as a Data Scientist or someone who works with data to have a good
    understanding of statistical analysis and the tools out there. There may be a
    time that you will require them.

- en: Within your team, as you are discussing projects and your next steps - you will
    start to see who has a Bayesian mindset and who has a Frequentist mindset. Data
    Scientists will work on probabilistic forecasting which combines residual variance
    with estimated uncertainty. This is specifically a Bayesian framework. However,
    it doesn’t rule out some experts wanting to use a frequentist approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the approach you take reflects on the statistical methods you choose.
    A lot of the fundamentals of data science are built on Bayesian statistics, and
    some even view frequentist approaches to be a subset of Bayesian theory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, when it comes to data science, your focus is on the problem at hand.
    Many data scientists choose their models based on the problem they are trying
    to solve. The upper hand that Bayesian approaches have is that in the world of
    data science, having specific knowledge about the problem is always an advantage.

- en: A Bayesian approach starts with an initial belief, which is backed by gathering
    evidence. This results in faster learning as you have evidence to support your
    statement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Frequentist approach bases their opinions on facts obtained from the data.
    Although they have had a look at the data, there has not been any analysis performed
    to ensure this is evidence. There are no calculations of the probability to back
    the hypothesis.

    Bayesian approaches and Frequentist approaches. There has been a lot of going
    back and forth between the two, and if one even exists without the other. My advice
    is to stick to what makes you feel comfortable and how your brain breaks things
    down through your personal logic.
