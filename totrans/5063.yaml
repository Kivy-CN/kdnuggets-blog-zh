    data mining software has gone through a lot of changes. One of the major ones
    is a recent transition to Python 3, obliterating the C++ components and instead
    using core Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and scikit-learn. Orange 3 has
    thus become the official distribution, with improved visualizations and additional
    functionalities.

    reads Google Sheets**. A great new feature in Orange is a chance to work with
    online data through URLs. With the increasing use of cloud services such as Google
    Drive, Orange can now work with Google Sheets. This is super efficient for sharing
    data sets and comparing results without having to send files through email or
    having to download them to your device.'

- en: '**2\. SQL data can stay on the database server.** Widgets, the computational
    units of Orange, no longer (necessarily) pass the data to each other: now they
    can also work on queries. The first widget establishes the connection with the
    database and sets up an initial query: a table, view or any manually constructed
    query. Instead of getting the data ![sql-database-on-server](../Images/9ad5dc926dbe0dc23903559fb38fe8c1.png)from
    the database, downstream widgets modify this query and retrieve the data only
    when and if necessary. Plotting a boxplot or constructing a naive Bayesian classifier
    at the end of a workflow would thus only retrieve the distributions. Similarly,
    discretization will use only a small subset of the data to find the appropriate
    thresholds and then add the binning operators to the query, never retrieving actual
    data rows from the server. Displaying the data in a table only retrieves the rows
    that are actually shown… Most of these operations work smoothly even on data tables
    of terabyte size.'

    We have considered small changes that would simplify the use of Orange and we
    have tried to remove small annoyances. One was setting the color palettes: if
    one decides to color the men blue and the women pink in one widget, why does she
    have to do the same in all widgets? Orange now has a widget for assigning colors
    to values for the entire schema. It’s just a small thing, nothing to brag about
    - but there are many such small details we are taking care of lately.'

- en: '**4\. Improved data pre-processing.** Say you have a classification data set
    with huge number of features. We can use feature subset selection and then test
    SVM or logistic regression through cross-validation. Right? Wrong (of course)!
    Pre-processing should be a part of the learner. Learners in Orange now accept
    pre-processors, including feature subset selectors on the input, but it’s still
    educational to observe how easy it is to overfit through the wrong use of pre-processing.'
