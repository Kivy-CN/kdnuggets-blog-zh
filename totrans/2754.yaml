    lives. From customized Netflix recommendations to personalized Spotify playlists
    to voice assistants like Alexa managing shopping lists and appliances – all these
    examples show how integral AI-enabled systems have become to our lives.

    Whether it is the automation of critical business processes, building an omnichannel
    supply chain, or empowering customer-facing teams with chatbots, AI-based systems
    have significantly reduced manual work and costs for businesses, leading to higher
    profitability.

    that [all is not well with artificial intelligence-based systems](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/)
    during the coronavirus pandemic. No, the virus does not impact AI – however, it
    does impact humans, without whom **AI** and ML systems cannot function properly.

    for quite some time to handle your inventory, customer support, and other such
    functions, your systems are likely to be well-trained and working efficiently
    without human intervention. Yet, that statement is only partially true, and that’s
    because your **machine learning** algorithms are not trained on the ‘new normal’
    that has emerged during the pandemic.

    patterns of supply and demand, and buyer behavior in general. For example, it
    only took a few days for the top items searched on Amazon across the globe to
    be populated with COVID-19 related products like toilet paper, face mask, and
    hand sanitizer. Things like phone chargers and Lego, which had been ruling the
    roost since ages, were quickly dethroned. Such drastic changes have also impacted
    **artificial intelligence**, as machine-learning models trained on normal behavior
    are suddenly facing massive deviations, and many are not working as they should.

    there have been several setbacks in the journey when machines have not worked
    as they should have – for one reason or the other. To start with, IBM’s “Watson
    for Oncology” that was supposed to eliminate cancer turned out to be an utterly
    ridiculous product. Before being shelved, the product was found to give incorrect
    medical advice that could potentially worsen the condition of the patients. According
    to [one source](https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/25/ibm-watson-recommended-unsafe-incorrect-treatments/),
    the problem lay in the fact that Watson was trained on a small number of “synthetic
    cancer cases” rather than real patient data. Even the recommendations were based
    on a few cancer specialists’ expertise than any written guidelines or evidence.

    towards white males](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G).
    The model was trained on the resumes submitted to Amazon for over ten years and
    benchmarked against the resumes of its presence engineering employees. In essence,
    the model trained itself to prefer men for the job. Some people familiar with
    the issue also reported that the system penalized resumes with the term “women’s”
    and downgraded resumes from two all-girl colleges.

    of a company that sells disinfectants. Considering that the retailer depended
    on an automated inventory management system, the chances are that the forecasts
    on which the company relied upon (generated by its predictive algorithms based
    on user behavior) no longer matched up with the actual demand spurt caused by
    the coronavirus – leading to severe demand and supply issues. In fact, with supply
    chains getting impacted the world over and new demand patterns surfacing for various
    companies, it is time to rethink the AI-enabled models employed for sales and
    budget forecasting. As the ‘new normal’ emerges during the current economic and
    social upheaval, the data and assumptions drilled into these ML models is no longer
    up to date and can lead to grave mistakes.

    This means the current black swan event is the perfect trigger to reimagine the
    training sets fed to our AI-ML systems. Many experts believe that AI should be
    trained not only on simple worst-case scenarios but also the watershed events
    in human history like the Great Depression of the 1930s, the 2007-08 financial
    crisis, and the present pandemic.

    extent. At present, most people are concerned about their health and that of their
    loved ones. Once again, social media has come in handy for both consuming and
    propagating news about the pandemic. Yet, many people can’t discern real news
    from fake news, which can have severe consequences in the real world. All of us
    are only too aware of the allegations against Facebook for its possible influence
    in the US elections by using its algorithms to push fake news. However, human
    oversight can help overcome the spread of fake news, as it is up to the readers
    to click on the sources, verify the story, and report fake news to the system
    to prevent its spread.

- en: Today, even as [humans look to AI for immortalizing themselves](https://medium.com/@laduram/how-can-artificial-intelligence-immortalize-human-beings-ccd60aeebf3c),
    they cannot leave AI to function independently without human oversight because
    machines are eventually machines and do not possess a moral or social compass.
    At best, AI is as good as the data it is trained upon, which, in turn, may reflect
    the bias, thought process, or the moral compass of its creators. To overcome such
    instances, it is necessary to train **AI** across disparate data sets and put
    human checks in place to maintain the delicate balance.
