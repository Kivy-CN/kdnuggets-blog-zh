    and why wouldn’t you? You nab a [six-figure average salary](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-much-do-data-scientists-make/),

    best data science education platform for you is one that caters to people who
    aren’t experienced at programming, who may not know what job they want, and who
    aren’t familiar with the dozens of potential languages.
  prefs: []

    for beginners. Its strength is that it doesn’t try to do everything. It has a
    series of straightforward tutorials for Python and SQL, both of which are top
    choices of languages for people just dipping their toes into data science.

    analytics at a very basic level, this is the best data science education platform.
    This platform will help ground you with entry-level skills in both languages.
    With their Python tutorials, the focus is on business data. For SQL, you’ll go
    through the process of answering data-based questions. You don’t need any coding
    language to start.
  prefs: []

    have an idea of what kind of job you want, or maybe even what company you want
    to work for, StrataScratch is the best data science education platform for you.
    This platform offers actual [questions asked in data science interviews](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/data-science-interview-guide-questions-from-80-different-companies/),
    with levels from easy to hard, from specific companies, using a specific language.
    You can go as niche as a hard Amazon interview question using Python (see [here](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10319-monthly-percentage-difference?python=1)),
    a medium-difficulty business case question from Uber (like [this one](https://platform.stratascratch.com/technical/2014-determining-origin-city)),
    and anything in between.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    platform for people who already know their way around the data science world.
    If you were a newbie, you might get overwhelmed. More experienced data science
    hopefuls will be able to extract a lot more value from it with a targeted approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: StrataScratch operates on a freemium model. Some of the questions are free,
    but most of the best ones are paywalled. This data science education platform
    costs $199 for a lifetime subscription, $29 per month, or $99 for an annual subscription.

    language, the best data science education platform for you is [Udemy](http://udemy.com/).
  prefs: []

    a host of very popular language classes. With over 5 million learners taking one
    of their data science [courses](https://www.udemy.com/topic/data-science/), you’ll
    definitely be able to find the right class for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason I recommend Udemy as the best data science education platform for
    a particular language is that Udemy’s strength is in the specialization. While
    they do offer courses that cover broader topics, like “Data Science 101,” and
    “Visualizations,” they host-specific instructors who are experts in the class
    they teach–and the very specific skill they teach you with that language. Udemy
    has talented individual teachers for pretty much any language you can imagine.
    For example, you can take a class as specific as “Machine Learning, Data Science
    and Deep Learning with Python” taught by expert Frank Kane.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the price point is reasonable. Just search for the language you want to learn,
    and see what’s on offer.

    because they’ll have you actually typing and working. The challenges offer an
    element of a community (as well as a bit of pressure if that’s the kind of thing
    that incentivizes you to work!).
