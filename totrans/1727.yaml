- en: We collected a list of the top influencers on LinkedIn, ranked by their number
    of followers, and limited to those who were active for the past three months.
    Those who did not publish anything, or anything relevant to Big Data, Data Science
    or Machine Learning on LinkedIn since June 2017, were not included. We note that
    one can create a totally different ranking by looking at the number of followers
    on other social media, e.g., Twitter. I hope you enjoy reading through each of
    the profiles. All percent changes in the number of followers is relative to a
    similar post [Top 16 Active Big Data, Data Science Leaders on LinkedIn](/2016/09/top-big-data-science-leaders-linkedin.html)
