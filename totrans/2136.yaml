- en: New language model (LM) prompting, communication, and training techniques keep
    emerging to enhance the LM reasoning and performance capabilities. One such emergence
    is the development of the [Chain of Code (CoC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04474),
    a method intended to advance code-driven reasoning in LMs. This technique is a
    fusion of traditional coding and the innovative emulation of LM code execution,
    which creates a powerful tool for tackling complex linguistic and arithmetic reasoning
    tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CoC is differentiated by its ability to handle intricate problems that blend
    logic, arithmetic, and language processing, which, as has been known to LM users
    for quite some time, has long been a challenging feat for standard LMs. CoC's
    effectiveness is not limited to large models but extends across various sizes,
    demonstrating versatility and broad applicability in AI reasoning.

- en: CoC is a paradigm shift in LM functionality; this is not a simple prompting
    tactic to increase the chance of eliciting the desired response from an LM. Instead,
    CoC redefines the the LM's approach to the aforementioned reasoning tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At its core, CoC enables LMs to not only write code but also to emulate parts
    of it, especially those aspects that are not directly executable. This duality
    allows LMs to handle a broader range of tasks, combining linguistic nuances with
    logical and arithmetic problem-solving. CoC is able to format linguistic tasks
    as pseudocode, and effectively bridge the gap between traditional coding and AI
    reasoning. This bridging allows for a flexible and more capable system for complex
    problem-solving. The LMulator, a main component of CoC's increased capabilities,
    enables the simulation and interpretation of code execution output that would
    otherwise not be directly available to the LM.

- en: CoC has shown remarkable success across different benchmarks, significantly
    outperforming existing approaches like Chain of Thought, particularly in scenarios
    that require a mix of linguistic and computational reasoning.

    other baselines across a variety of benchmarks; on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code
    achieves 84%, a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought.

- en: The CoC technique is an advancement in enhancing the reasoning abilities of
    LMs. CoC broadens the scope of problems LMs can tackle by integrating code writing
    with selective code emulation. This approach demonstrates the potential for AI
    to handle more complex, real-world tasks that require nuanced thinking. Importantly,
    CoC has proven to excel in both small and large LMs, enabling a pathway for the
    increasing array of smaller models to potentially improve their reasoning capabilities
    and bring their effectiveness closer to that of larger models.
