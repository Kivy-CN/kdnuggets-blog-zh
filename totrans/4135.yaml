    (which, in turn, leads to mastery), and that trial and error is key to success.
    If that's the case, learning Python by following a project-based approach makes
    good sense. Following that logic, you should probably check out this free Python
    project-based coding course from feeCodeCamp.

    lives up to its name and clocks in at almost exactly 3 hours. It walks you from
    Python newbie to what you might call a proficient intermediate Pythonista in this
    length of time, all while focusing on the bigger picture. While many newcomers
    to Python — or, indeed, programming — start with by learning syntax and concentrating
    on understanding concepts in isolation, project-based learning forces one to think
    about where these concepts with into the bigger picture from square one.

    to learn about how to practically implement it into a project that does much more.
