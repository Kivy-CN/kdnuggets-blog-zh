    split a group of people, like your users or end customers, in half. Offer one
    half Option A. Offer the other half Option B. Now see which option performs better.

- en: I gave a brief description above, but I want to use this section to investigate
    the concept deeper. When you get asked about A/B tests in your data science interview,
    your interviewer will want you to demonstrate both conceptual understanding and
    your business acumen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s talk about concepts first. A/B testing is A type of statistical and two-sample
    hypothesis testing. When you do [statistical hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing),
    you're comparing a sample data set against the population data. [Two-sample hypothesis
    testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sample_hypothesis_testing) is when
    you use statistics to see if the difference between the two samples is significant
    or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When you set up an A/B test, you need two hypotheses: your null hypothesis,
    and your alternative hypothesis. Your null hypothesis says any change you observe
    is purely from chance. Basically, it means you think there will be no difference

- en: You will have to develop criteria for your control and test group, too. You
    probably won’t have the resources to do your A/B test on the entire population
    of users, so you need to come up with a good way to select a sample population.
    The key is to sample randomly to ensure you have significant results.
  prefs: []

    to selecting a random sample. Make sure your sample is big enough to be statistically
    relevant. I recommend Andrew Fisher’s [guide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259607496_Stratified_Fisher's_Exact_Test_and_its_Sample_Size_Calculation)
    on the subject.

    your control group has an average spend of $50, with a standard deviation of $15\.
    Your test group has a retention rate of $53, with a standard deviation of $16.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That may not seem like very much, but with such large sample sizes you can be
    extremely confident in rejecting your null hypothesis – that gives us a p-value
    (two-tailed) = 0.000016, which means there’s only a 0.0016% chance that the outcome
    is through luck or chance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are tons of different factors when it comes to choosing the appropriate
    test. If you have a small sample size (n<30) you’ll choose a t-test rather than
    a z-test. If you believe your sample mean could be greater, less than, or the
    same as your control mean, you’ll choose a two-tailed test. I’m a fan of Antoine
    Soetewey’s [flowchart](https://statsandr.com/blog/files/overview-statistical-tests-statsandr.pdf)
    to make a decision. Reviewing this chart will give you a comprehensive overview
    of the assumptions behind A/B tests and their designs.
