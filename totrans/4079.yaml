- en: Python is a magical language with many concepts that even advanced users may
    not be familiar with. Dunder or Magical methods is one of them. Magic methods
    are special methods that are surrounded by double underscores. They are not called
    explicitly unlike the ordinary methods in python. One such magic method is the
    `__getitem__` method, enabling the Python objects to behave like sequences or
    containers e.g lists, dictionaries, and tuples. It takes the index or slice and
    retrieves its associated value from the collection. It is invoked automatically
    whenever we use the `indexer [ ]` operator to access the elements within your
    object.

    required information just by writing a few lines of code. Interesting right? This
    method is also used widely in data analysis and machine learning. So, let's dive
    deeper into the `__getitem__` method and discover its power and flexibility.

    just writing functional code. Your code should be efficient, readable, and maintainable.
    Using `__getitem__` will help you achieve these goals. Here are some other benefits
    of using this magic method:'

    Now you might think that how is it different from the built-in `indexer []` operator?
    Wherever you use this notation, python automatically calls the `__getitem__` method
    for you and is the shorthand for accessing elements. But if you want to change
    the behavior of indexing for custom objects, you need to explicitly call the `__getitem__`
    method.

    will have the list of all the students and we can access them by index and consider
    that the index represents their unique student ID.

    behavior using the `__getitem__` method. Suppose that I have a list of string
    elements and I want to retrieve the element whenever I enter its index position
    and I can also get the index position if I enter the string itself.

    Considering the flexibility and versatility of this method, I would say this is
    one of the most underutilized magic methods of Python. I hope you enjoyed reading

    know about the other magic methods in Python.
