    paradoxes** in any data science application. Ignoring these elements can therefore
    completely undermine the conclusions of our analysis.

    that are completely reverted in the aggregated data**. In this article we look
    at the 3 most common kinds of statistical paradoxes encountered in Data Science.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    severity and smoking cigarettes **(see e.g. the European Commission review by [Wenzel
    2020](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/smoking-and-covid-19-review-studies-suggesting-protective-effect-smoking-against-covid-19)).
    Smoking cigarettes is a well-known risk factor for respiratory diseases, so how
    do we explain this contradiction?

    published on Nature suggests that this can be a case of **Collider Bias**, also
    called [**Berkson’s Paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox).
    To understand this paradox, let us consider the following graphical model, where
    we include a third random variable: “being hospitalized”.'

    cigarettes” and “COVID-19 severity”. (Image by author)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This third variable “being hospitalized” is a [**collider**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(statistics)) of
    the first two. This means that both smoking cigarettes and having severe COVID-19
    increase chances of being ill in a hospital. Berkson’s Paradox precisely arises
    when we **condition on a collider**, i.e. when we only observe data from hospitalized
    people rather than considering the whole population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from the whole population, while on the right figure we only consider a subset
    of hospitalized people (i.e. we condition on the collider variable).

    opposite trend! To understand this, consider the following points.

    particular, if severity > 1 hospitalization is required.

    (heart attacks, cancer, diabetes), which increase the chances of being hospitalized
    for some reason.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, if a **hospital patient** has **lower COVID-19** **severity**, they have **higher
    chances of smoking cigarettes**! Indeed, they must have some disease different
    from COVID-19 (e.g. heart attacks, cancer, diabetes) to justify their hospitalization,
    and this disease may very well be caused by their smoking cigarettes.

    hospital patients, despite diabetes being a risk factor for cholecystitis.

- en: The presence of a [**latent variable**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable)may
    also produce an apparently inverted correlation between two variables. While Berkson’s
    Paradox arises because of the conditioning on a collider variable (which should
    therefore be avoided), this other kind of paradox can be fixed by **conditioning
    on the latent variable**.

    to extinguish a fire and the number people that are injured in the fire. We would
    expect that having more firefighters would improve the outcome (to some extent—see [Brooks’s
    Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)), yet a positive correlation
    is observed in aggregated data: **the more firefighters are deployed, the higher
    the number of injured**!
