    amounts of data for AI and machine learning (ML) advancements. Analyst firm Cognilytica
    estimates that as much as [80% of machine learning project time](https://www.cognilytica.com/2019/04/19/infographic-data-prep-and-labeling/)
    is spent on aggregating, cleaning, labeling, and augmenting machine learning model
    data. And a mere 20% of ML project time is spent on algorithm development, model
    training and tuning, and ML operationalization.

    to source data labelers for machine learning projects. Each choice brings benefits
    and challenges, depending on project needs, but for most organizations, understanding
    the tradeoffs helps pave the way for a clear strategic data labeling roadmap.
