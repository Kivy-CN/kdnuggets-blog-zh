- en: Data Science is a challenging field and just showing that you have a certification
    or a university degree is not enough to obtain a job in industry. The recruiters
    need to understand what value you can add to the company compared to the other
    candidates.

- en: Since a qualification is not enough by itself to land a job in data science,
    the best moment in getting started to do different experiences is when you are
    a student. You still are young, have more time than you think and energies that
    can be exploited in increasing your possibilities in getting your first data science
    job.

    I didn’t have any experience in that field obviously. The projects I did during
    my master degree helped me in demonstrating my skills to the company.

    GitHub. You surely should not only focus your attention on python scripts/jupyter
    notebooks, but also a READ.me file that explains well how the project is organised
    and the results obtained.

    managers was [Topic Modeling with BERTopic](https://github.com/eugeniaring/topic-modeling-reviews),
    in which I trained a BERTopic model to identify topics from e-commerce clothing
    reviews and interpreted the results through interactive data visualisations. It
    helped to demonstrate that I was able to solve a NLP problem.

    publications, like Towards AI and Towards Data Science, allowing me to reach a
    lot of readers from different countries, put into practice what I have learned
    during my university courses, go deeper in unknown topics that I was interested
    to explore, receive job proposals and, even, earn money.

    first when you start, especially the negative comments, but it really helps to
    improve your critical thinking and open your mind to other possible solutions
    in solving a problem.

    but you should take into consideration how much time it will take to build the
    website. Anyway, it has become easier thanks to Chat-GPT and other AI tools based
    on Large Language Models.

    is an important skill for a data scientist, but also recording Youtube Videos
    can prove what you are made of.

    itself can be enough. There are a lot of known DS influencers that are known for
    their great capacity in building video content, like StatQuest with Josh Starmer,
    Data Professor and Patrick Loeber.

    to gain experience is working as a freelance data scientist. It’s a good alternative
    to the traditional 9-to-5 job: it can guarantee freedom and flexibility, especially
    when you are a student and you also need time to attend and study the university
    courses.'

    apply for data science freelance gigs published by clients. You can also reach
    or be reached by clients in LinkedIn, which is considered the best social network
    for connecting with people belonging to the data science community.

    science competitions. I would highlight that it’s not so important that you do
    a lot of competitions, it’s better that you focus on real-world projects that
    can be valuable for the company that is interviewing you. Quality is always more
    important than quantity.

    You have surely consulted this website while searching data science topics, datasets
    and other stuff. Other competitions can be found in [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/),
    [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/) and [DevPost](https://devpost.com/).
