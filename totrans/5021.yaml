    Places API and IMDb API we selected places in the Golden City, which every movie
    fan should visit, while they are in town.

    San Francisco airport, the Mobile Food Facility Permits, the Aircraft Noise Complaint

    the information about the longitude and latitude was missing so we were not able
    to plot these locations onto a map right away. We found the geo coordinates for
    all the places using Google Places API, and plotted them on the map using Python
    library gmplot.

- en: In order to do a graph analysis on these locations, we needed to come up with
    a way to set up the edges of the graph accordingly. For this, we used the handy
    thing called Google API, where you can compute driving, cycling or walking distances
    between any two geographical locations. These travel times were taken as edge
    values between each of the pairs of locations (nodes or vertices). We built the
    graph using places from the top 7 movies with cycling and driving distances between
    these places. Furthermore, only 2 edges, those to the 2 closest places, were created
    for each location. The logic behind this is to avoid using paths with long travel
    times.

    of this graph were created from the cycling distances between locations.

    of a particular location. Betweenness is equal to the number of shortest paths
    from all the vertices (in our case the locations) to all others that pass through
    that node. A location with high betweenness has large influence on transfer of
    people through the network of the top movie locations under the assumption that
    people are always looking for the shortest path. We have compared locations with
    the biggest betweenness using edges based on driving as well as cycling distance.
    We came up with following results:'

    Howard Street and Mission & Beal were replaced with Washington Street & Waverly

    that movie fans are more likely to pass through the Chinatown of San Francisco

    to our dataset. The TSP is an optimization problem of finding the shortest possible
    route to visit each from given set of places. Using a random start and iterative
    algorithm we came up with a single route that any movie fan should take if they
    want to visit all of the interesting places from famous movies.

    10 locations in 1 route, therefore four layers were created. The descriptions
    start with A and end with J for each layer, J is overlapping with A from the next
    layer. The beginning of each layer is marked with a number for better readability.
