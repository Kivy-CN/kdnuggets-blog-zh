    this to happen between 4 and 10 years from now. The most common answer was 4-6
    years and the median answer was in 8-9 year range - see Fig. 1.

    burst and demand will begin to decline, but as with many bubbles, it is hard to
    predict when. Peak demand (start of decline) somewhere between 4 and 9 years seems
    reasonable to me. This does not mean, of course, that Data Scientists will become
    unemployed, but the job will become a regular one, and salaries will stabilize,
    as happened, for example, with web developers - it was a very hot job at the beginning
    of the internet, but is a regular job now.

    how young is this field now. 62% of respondents were from industry, 19.5% - students,
    9.2% - researchers, and 4.5% - government/non-profit.

    I got similar curves, with one peak at 4-6 or 7-10 years and a second, smaller
    peak at 25 years or more. To simplify the chart, I grouped the lines for "none"
    and "<1 year" experience, and for "1-2" and "2-4" years, which in both cases looked
    very similar.

    only in 25 years or more "optimists", and the other group - "pessimists".

- en: Again, the most surprising finding is that the curves again are similar. The
    one notable difference is that US/Canada respondents were more optimistic - their
    most common choice was peak demand in 7-10 years, while in other regions it was
    4-6 years. The percent of people saying 25 years or more was amazingly similar
    (18.3% to 19.8%) in all regions.

- en: One hypothesis is that people by nature are frequently optimists or pessimists,
    and that affects their predictions. Perhaps when asking about predictions about
    things like social trends that cannot be determined from physics but depend on
    people's feelings and intuition, polls should somehow measure the trait of optimism
    vs pessimism.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    across different affiliations and regions, and does not change much with experience.
