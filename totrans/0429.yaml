  id: totrans-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One reason could be the **name itself**. Perhaps, hiring managers and recruiters
    promote a data science title without the level of seniority attached, and hire
    based on how people do in the interview. For example, if they are a junior, data
    scientist I, data scientist II, or senior data scientist, principal/staff data
    scientist, data scientist manager, etc.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason could be the company **headcount/hiring capacity**. It could
    be possible that a company only has funds for one data scientist, and they prefer
    to hire a senior one over a junior one. This difference can depend on if the company
    is smaller or larger, and their possible required projects.
