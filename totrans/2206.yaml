    model, but you should understand the most common ones. Here are seven essential
    ML algorithms every data scientist should know.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many companies prefer to use supervised learning models for their accuracy and
    straightforward real-world applications. While unsupervised learning is growing,
    supervised techniques are an excellent place to start as a data scientist.

- en: 1\. Linear Regression
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linear regression is the [most fundamental model for predicting values](/handson-with-supervised-learning-linear-regression)
    based on continuous variables. It assumes there’s a linear relationship between
    two variables and uses it to plot outcomes based on a given input.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the right data set, these models are easy to train and implement and relatively
    reliable. However, real-world relationships aren’t often linear, so it has limited
    relevance in many business applications. It also doesn’t manage outliers well,
    so it’s not ideal for large, varied data sets.

- en: 2\. Logistic Regression
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A similar but distinct machine learning algorithm you should know is logistic
    regression. Despite the similarity in name to linear regression, [it’s a classification
    algorithm](/2022/11/comparing-linear-logistic-regression.html), not an estimation
    one. Whereas linear regression predicts a continuous value, logistic regression
    predicts the probability of data falling into a given category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Logistic regression is common in predicting customer churn, forecasting weather
    and projecting product success rates. Like linear regression, it’s easy to implement
    and train but prone to overfitting and struggles with complex relationships.

- en: 3\. Decision Trees
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decision trees are a fundamental model you can use for classification and regression.
    They split data into homogeneous groups and keep segmenting them into further
    categories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because decision trees work like flow charts, they’re ideal for complex decision-making
    or anomaly detection. Despite their relative simplicity, though, they can take
    time to train.

- en: 4\. Naive Bayes
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Naive Bayes is another simple yet effective classification algorithm. These
    models operate on Bayes’ Theorem, [which determines conditional probability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bayes-theorem.asp)
    — the likelihood of an outcome based on similar occurrences in the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These models are popular in text-based and image classification. They may be
    too simplistic for real-world predictive analytics, but they’re excellent in these
    applications and handle large data sets well.

- en: 5\. Random Forest
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you might guess from the name, random forests consist of multiple decision
    trees. Training each tree on randomized data and grouping the results lets these
    models produce more reliable results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Random forests are more resistant to overfitting than decision trees and are
    more accurate in real-world applications. That reliability comes at a cost, though,
    as they can also be slow and require more computing resources.

    are some of the most popular of this less common but still important category.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: K-means clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning
    algorithms. These models classify data by grouping it into clusters based on their
    similarities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: K-means clustering is ideal for customer segmentation. That makes it valuable
    to businesses that want to refine marketing or speed onboarding, thus [reducing
    their costs and churn rates](https://www.connectpointz.com/blog/speed-up-customer-onboarding-process)
    in the process. It’s also useful for anomaly detection. However, it’s essential
    to standardize the data before feeding it to these algorithms.

- en: 7\. Singular Value Decomposition
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Singular value decomposition (SVD) models break complex data sets into easier-to-understand
    bits by separating them into their fundamental parts and removing redundant information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Image compression and noise removal are some of the most popular applications
    for SVD. Considering how [file sizes keep growing](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2107/2107.03272.pdf#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20the%20average,influences%20in%20the%20size%20distributions.),
    those use cases will become increasingly valuable over time. However, building
    and applying these models can be time-consuming and complex.

    types. Understanding these will help kickstart your career in data science and
    make it easier to comprehend other, more complex algorithms that build on these
    basics.
