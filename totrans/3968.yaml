    tutorial will show examples of how NumPy speeds up the code process. Let's jump

    than that of the Python list in acquiring the same result.

    see if we want to perform aggregation statistical analysis.

    NumPy. If we had a much bigger dataset, Python would take way longer to finish
    the NumPy.

- en: Another example is when we try to perform in-place operations, we can see that
    the NumPy would be much faster than the Python example.

    Multiplication, which uses standard Python code.

    built-in function execution times.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NumPy is a powerful package for mathematical and numerical processes. Compared
    to the standard Python in-built function, NumPy execution time would be faster
    than the Python counterpart. That is why, try to use NumPy if it’s applicable
    to speed up our Python code.
