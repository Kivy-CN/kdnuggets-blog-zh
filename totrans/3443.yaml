- en: With the Fannie Mae dataset, we’ll try to predict whether a loan will be foreclosed
    on in the future by only using information that was available when the loan was
    acquired. In effect, we’ll create a “score” for any mortgage that will tell us
    if Fannie Mae should buy it or not. This will give us a nice foundation to build
    on, and will be a great portfolio piece.

    We’ll also want to ignore the data files because they are very large, and the
    Fannie Mae terms prevent us from redistributing them, so we should add two lines

    guide on markdown. If you upload a file called `README.md` to Github, Github will
