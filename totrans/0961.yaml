    algorithms work. Linear algebra, statistics, probability, and calculus are the
    four key sub-fields that are pre-requisite to learning the internals of the algorithms.
    The post lists down the courses to learn calculus, but let's first understand
    the need to learn calculus.

    neuron weights in the backpropagation of a neural network. Essentially, you need
    calculus to comprehend the association between a set of inputs and output variables.
    This study of multiple attributes is called multivariate calculus and is used
    in calculating the minimum and maximum values of a function, derivatives, cost
    functions, etc.
