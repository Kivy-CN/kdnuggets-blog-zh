    and unsupervised learning. In this article, I want to discuss an often forgotten
    but equally powerful algorithm: Monte Carlo Simulation. I will share a general
    design framework and a few techniques with an interactive tool. Finally, you can
    also find a list of good simulation tools at the end of the article.'

- en: Inthe recent Machine Learning (ML) uprising, supervised and unsupervised learning
    algorithms, such as classification with [Deep Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/) and
    clustering with KNN, got most of the spotlight. When these algorithms receive
    flattering praises from the enthusiastic community, something equally powerful
    and elegant sits in the dark corner calmly and quietly. Its name is **Monte Carlo **—
    the forgotten and undeserving hero of atomic physics, modern finance, and gambling
    (or a villain depends on your opinions of these matters).

- en: If I were to highlight one (oversimplified) advantage of Simulation over ML
    algorithms, it would be this: **Exploration. **We use Simulation to understand
    the inner working *of any systems at any scale* (e.g. the world, a community,
    a company, a team, a person, a fleet, a car, a wheel, an atom, etc.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By re-creating a system virtually with simulations, we can calculate and analyze
    hypothetical results without actually changing the world or waiting for real events
    to happen. In other words, Simulations allow us to **ask bold questions** and **develop
    tactics **to manage various future outcomes without much risk and investment.

- en: According to [Benjamin Schumann](https://www.benjamin-schumann.com/blog/2018/5/7/time-to-marry-simulation-models-and-machine-learning),
    a well-known simulation expert, Simulation is *process-driven* while ML is *data-centric*.
    To produce good Simulation, we need to understand the process and underlying principles
    of a system. In contrast, we can create reasonably good predictions using ML by
    only using data from a data warehouse and some out-of-box algorithms.
  prefs: []

    and cognitively. Why would we ever use Simulation?

    between sales volume and price). To obtain such knowledge, it typically requires
    talking to experts, studying process flows, and observing real business operations.
