    place in multiple categories. For example, TensorFlow is included in this list
    but Keras has been omitted and features in the [Machine Learning library collection](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/10/top-python-machine-learning-libraries.html)
    instead. This is because Keras is more of an ‘end-user’ library like SKLearn,
    as opposed to TensorFlow which appeals more to researchers and Machine Learning
    engineer types.
