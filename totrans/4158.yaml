    ability to state what assumptions we made. That way, others can critique your

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Codecademy's course looks like a safe bet to start your Python journey. But,
    no matter which course you choose, tackle projects as often as possible. Find
    a problem you're interested in and keep programming until you have something that
    solves it. Show off your solution, use it to help others, and even make a career
    out of it. Using Python — and programming in general — to create value for yourself
    and others is a rewarding feedback loop that will keep you working, moving forward,
    and getting better.
