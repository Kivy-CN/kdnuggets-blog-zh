    we can see that a single meal at this restaurant generally costs around $10 to

    with prices above $50.

    diners is almost the same — approximately $15-$19\. However, there is a huge difference
    in the minimum and maximum amounts spent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are female diners who have spent as low as $5 on a meal, and the maximum
    amount spent is around $30\. This could be because women tend to eat less than
    men, or dine out in smaller groups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or when out with a larger group of people, which might be why the most expensive
    bills are under their name.

    to demonstrate the correlation between X and Y.
  prefs: []

    An initial assumption before creating the chart is that higher bill prices would
    mean an increase in the tips paid.

    every numeric variable in the dataset at once.
  prefs: []

    its correlation to other variables is displayed as a scatterplot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Seaborn’s pairplot() method is useful when analyzing a dataset that has multiple
    numeric features. In this case, for example, there are 3 numeric variables, and
    it is a lot easier to view their relationships in a single chart than having to
    create 9 separate visualizations.

    and doesn’t require you to write a lot of complex code.
  prefs: []

    of analysis. For example — regression plots to visualize two numeric variables,
    or bar plots for one numeric and one categorical variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, always make sure you start out with a question in mind before creating
    any kind of visualization. The purpose of a visualization is to tell you (or another
    person) something about the data that you don’t already know.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a visualization we created above, for example, we set out to understand if
    men were spending more on food in the restaurant than women. Then, we decided
    that we’d look into the relationship between gender and total bill amount with
    the help of a bar chart.
