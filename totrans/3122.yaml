- en: Machine learning is everywhere. From advertising to IoT to healthcare, and beyond,
    virtually all industries are adopting or investigating machine learning (ML) to
    benefit their business. However, to generate a positive return on investment (ROI)
    using ML, it needs to be *operationalized* or put into production.

- en: In most cases, ML is used to optimize (i.e. add insights to) a business application.
    While this sounds simple, an ML operation frequently requires multiple complementary
    but independent ML programs (training, inference, etc.) to run in cooperation.
    What is an ML application? An ML application is the collection of programs and
    dependencies that together deliver the ML functionality to your business application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Figure 1(a) shows the most basic way that ML can be added to a business application.
    The business application makes requests for predictions, which can be served by
    an ML inference program (micro-services approaches are popular here). The ML inference
    program uses a model that was trained offline, likely by a data scientist.  While
    this flow is simple, it is frequently not sufficient. Industries where data changes
    frequently (such as Adtech) require models to be frequently retrained to keep
    up with changing circumstances. A re-training pipeline then needs to be added
    to feed the inference, resulting in the pattern in Figure 1(b).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Retraining brings many models into the mix, and human intervention may be required
    to decide which ones to deploy to production (this is particularly important in
    situations where fiscal, health or other outcomes are tied to ML predictions).
    Adding human approvals results in Figure 1(c). If advanced algorithms (like ensemble
    models) are used to improve accuracy, the pattern becomes that of Figure 1(d).
  prefs: []

- en: Finally, many production deployments use multiple prediction pipelines in parallel
    (Champion/Challenger, Canary etc.) to monitor prediction patterns, and detect
    unexpected shifts or anomalies. Adding such test infrastructure generates a pattern
    similar to Figure 1(e).

- en: ML applications exist to serve a business need. Success metrics or key performance
    indicators (KPIs) for the business application should be tracked and correlated
    with the introduction of, and subsequent optimizations to, the ML application.
    Such correlation provides visibility for all stakeholders, ensures that ML investments
    are generating adequate returns and helps everyone from data scientists, to operations
    personnel measure and justify new operational investments.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Risk management does not end at model development. Once operational, models
    need to be monitored and constantly evaluated to ensure that they are operating
    within expected bounds. Production ML health is complicated by the fact that live
    data does not have labels (and as such common metrics such as Accuracy, Precision,
    Recall etc. cannot be used). Alternative methods (such as Data Deviation Detection,
    Drift Detection, Canary Pipelines, Production A/B tests) should be part of the
    ML application.

- en: Some industries, such as [financial services](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107a1.pdf),
    have had ML compliance requirements for many years. Other industries and geographies
    are beginning to introduce guidelines, such as [GDPR](http://www.reubenbinns.com/blog/how-to-comply-with-gdpr-article-22-automated-credit-decisions/)
    in the EU or the [New York City Algorithmic Accountability Bill](https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2017/12/13/n-y-c-council-passes-landmark-bill-to-ensure.html).
    A comprehensive production governance mechanism is critical to ensure that ML
    applications (and all of their consequent models, pipelines, code, executions,
    etc.) are tracked for reproducibility, auditability and to assist [explainability](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~alanwags/DLAI2016/(Gunning)%20IJCAI-16%20DLAI%20WS.pdf).

- en: Machine learning pipelines are code, and classic DevOps toolchain components
    (source code repositories such as Git, automation facilities such as Jenkins,
    orchestrators such as AirFlow, etc.) play an important role in MLOps. However,
    in addition to the business focus, risk reduction and compliance needs, production
    ML also presents additional CI/CD and orchestration challenges that are not addressed
    by common DevOps toolchains. For example, ML applications like Figure 1(e) can
    have multiple pipelines executing in parallel, with ML-specific interdependencies
    (such as Model Approval/Propagation or Drift Detection) that also need to be managed.
    This ML CI/CD and ML orchestration needs to integrate seamlessly with the DevOps
    practices already in place in the organization.

- en: ML applications can require hardware configurations and scalability points that
    are different from the business applications that they serve. For example, training
    neural network models can require powerful GPUs and training regular ML models
    can require clusters of CPUs. Depending on the inference implementation, clusters
    of stream processors, REST endpoints or batch inference operations may be required.
    Many powerful, production-grade analytic engines (such as Spark, Flink, PyTorch,
    scikit-learn, etc.) exist to execute ML pipelines. The ML application needs to
    be sized and mapped to one or more of these engines as necessary for the pipelines
    within.

    data engineers, business analysts and operations) to collaborate. Each needs to
    see different aspects of the ML application. Data scientists may be preoccupied
    with metrics of training accuracy, production A/B test confidence or data deviation
    detection while operations may want to see uptime and resource utilization, and
    business analysts may want to see improvement of KPIs. The MLOps toolchain needs
    to provide visibility, managed access control, and collaboration for all such
    parties.
