    exhibiting remarkable improvements in achieving a more natural-sounding output.
    The advancements in this field are not limited to speech generation alone; rather
    significant strides are being made in the development of music and ambient sound
    generators and speech cloning, which are rapidly evolving.

    model capable of producing various spoken languages, ambient sounds, music, and
    multi-speaker prompts. We will delve into its functionalities and key features
    and get a starting guide.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark), developed by [Suno](https://suno.ai/),
    is a transformer-based text-to-audio model that excels in generating highly realistic,
    multilingual speech, music, background noise, and even simple sound effects. Additionally,
    the model can produce various nonverbal communications, such as laughter, sighs,
    and cries. You can access pre-trained model checkpoints that are ready for inference.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bark, like [Vall-E](http://vall-e) and other impressive works in the field,
    employs GPT-style models for generating audio from scratch. However, unlike Vall-E,
    Bark uses high-level semantic tokens to embed the initial text prompt, without
    relying on phonemes. It allows Bark to generalize to a wide range of arbitrary
    instructions beyond speech, including music lyrics, sound effects, and non-speech
    sounds present in the training data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The generated semantic tokens are then processed by a second model to convert
    them into audio codec tokens, producing the complete waveform. To make Bark accessible
    to the community via public code, we integrated the remarkable [EnCodec codec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec)
    from Facebook as an audio representation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bark has used [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) for blazing fast
    implementation of GPT-style models, [EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec)
    for the implementation of a fantastic audio codec, [AudioLM](https://github.com/lucidrains/audiolm-pytorch)
    for training and inference code, and [Vall-E](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111),
    [AudioLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03143), and similar papers for the development
    of Bark project.

    the language of the input text. Even when the text contains a mixture of different
    languages, known as code-switching, Bark can accurately identify and apply the
    native accent for each language in the same voice.

    speech and music. While Bark may sometimes generate text as music, you can enhance
    its performance by adding music notes around your lyrics to help it distinguish
    between the two.

    emotion, and prosody while also preserving other audio features, such as music
    and ambient noise. However, to prevent the misuse of this advanced technology,
    they have implemented limitations. Users are only allowed to choose from a select
    set of fully synthetic options provided by Suno.

    particularly if there is a conflicting audio history prompt present.
