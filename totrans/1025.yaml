    taking into account the strength of our prior beliefs. Deploying Bayes Theorem,
    you seek to answer the question: **what is the likelihood of my hypothesis in
    light of new evidence?**

    dinner because she’s taking care of a koala, we need to consider the **likelihood** of
    your friend needing to stay home with the koala given the hypothesis that your
    friend is an upstanding person who doesn’t ditch dinner plans without good reason.
    You might conclude there’s a high likelihood that a good friend who is typically
    responsible would stay home to look after a pet.
  prefs: []

    friend called, how strong was your belief in her commitment to dinner plans? If
    you believe your friend is rock solid and typically unwilling to change plans
    at the last minute, then your prior probability is strong, and you would be unlikely
    to change this view, irrespective of new evidence. On the other hand, if your
    friend is flakey and you were already wondering whether she’d call to cancel,
    your prior probability is weak, which may also call into question her claim about
    staying home with the koala.

    (in this case, positive or negative) could generate some input data. Given an

    most likely to have generated the observation. This is in contrast to a discriminative
    classifier such as logistic regression that learns the predictive power of input
    features.
