    sea of data and gain meaningful insights to help improve public health. The COVID-19
    pandemic has caused a global catastrophe, a devastating loss of human life, and
    unprecedented socioeconomic disruptions**. But what if we could have gotten ahead
    of this spread and stopped the surge before it even happened?**

    This is exactly where FluDemic comes in.  Our goal is to assist government, health
    system administrators, community leadership, and all people to be proactive in
    their decision-making through data. Our experienced data scientists and analysts
    have worked closely to study the patterns of spread, understand various socioeconomic
    impacts, and create predictive models using proprietary machine learning algorithms.
    FluDemic currently provides a platform to track and predict COVID-19 and Influenza-Like
    Illnesses (ILI).

    categories of places, such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies,

    to the [World Health Oganization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2020-impact-of-covid-19-on-people's-livelihoods-their-health-and-our-food-systems),
    “Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce is at risk of losing
    their livelihoods.” FluDemic sheds some light on this by tracking unemployment
    rates. Numerous businesses have gone bankrupt, and millions more face an existential
    threat. These repercussions are captured by the Composite Leading Indicator (CLI),
    which shows fluctuations in economic activity, and Confidence Indexes, which represent
    national business outlooks and household spending.

    several different sources are providing key data for cases, deaths, testing, hospitalizations,
    mobility, unemployment, confidence indexes, social distancing measures, and vaccinations. 
    For influenza, data is being sourced to display measures such as Influenza-Like-Illness
    (ILI), pneumonia and influenza deaths, vaccination rates, and testing.  Please

    are challenging for several reasons. Privacy and confidentiality issues make it
    difficult to distribute data on an individual level publicly. Thus much of the
    information available is at the population level. Essential information, such
    as a person’s pre-existing conditions, cannot be accounted for in public models.
    When dealing with large-scale data, we need to acknowledge that the collection
    process and quality of data vary greatly from state to state. For instance, influenza
    surveillance is a voluntary process, and each state reports its information with
    a different degree of completeness and with different delays. Such variation in
    the reporting regime tends to obscure finer regional differences.

- en: The modeling of a modern epidemic is also complicated by the real-world situations
    in a highly interconnected world, where the frequency of long-range travel can
    elevate an epidemic to a global phenomenon in a matter of weeks. It is not enough
    to only consider the local transmission. The models must incorporate the connectivity
    of populations. To balance this, we have greater amounts and better data than
    ever before to quantify such behavior.

    Infection, Hospitalization, and Fatality (e.g., [estimating individual risks of
    COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death using publicly available data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0243026)).
    The process begins with exposure, where one or more uninfected individuals are
    in proximity to an infected person. Although exposure can occur at home or a grocery
    store, it is compounded when unprotected groups of people are in close proximity
    for a significant period of time. Dining indoors at bars and restaurants or participating
    in live events can trigger a large number of people being simultaneously exposed
    to the disease, even if a very small fraction of the participants are infected.
    Following exposure, each infectious disease is characterized by an incubation
    period during which time the virus infects the body and multiplies. After this
    period, symptoms exhibit, and the individual is likely tested and a case recorded.
    The modeling challenge involves identifying the statistical distribution of incubation
    delay and incorporating it into models which track exposure-inducing circumstances.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a fraction of the population, the infected individual shows severe deterioration
    in health, leading to hospitalization and occasionally death. However, both hospitalization
    and subsequent death follow time delays, which vary significantly from individual
    to individual, often associated with the patient’s pre-existing conditions, the
    access to, and quality of therapeutic care. While incorporating this into our
    population-level models, we use time delay distributions and their convolutions
    to track the progression from infection to death. We also note that for a novel
    disease like COVID-19, the treatment regimens evolve through the life of the epidemic,
    and so does the case fatality. Access to quality care is affected when hospital
    beds—especially ICU beds and ventilators—become restricted during surges. Despite
    the complexities, knowing the state of cases and hospitalizations gives us a window
    into the future of expected fatalities.

    or deaths after accounting for expected variation. Sequence time-series models
    coupled with time-delayed regressors are used to predict the trend of daily cases
    and deaths for each county. The resulting predictions are then scaled by population
    and smoothed using a seven-day rolling average, letting us identify emerging hotspots.

- en: To connect the cases and deaths in a particular county to the underlying demographic
    and socioeconomic factors, we compute the risk factors associated with the population
    scaled measures of infections (morbidity) and deaths (mortality). The primary
    demographic and socioeconomic factors include the population and population density
    of a county, along with the age, income, and household-size distributions. During
    an epidemic, behavioral factors such as measures of mobility and mask usage also
    inform the risk model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The multitude of factors associated with socioeconomic risk are not independent
    of each other—each factor providing some independent information while also being
    measures of common patterns. We unravel this information into independent combinations
    using a variety of techniques such as Principal-Component Analysis which also
    allows us to reduce the number of independent model parameters, making the risk
    estimates robust (e.g., [socioeconomic status and cardiovascular health in the
    COVID-19 pandemic](https://heart.bmj.com/content/107/5/358)).

- en: A second important aspect of modeling risk is the inherent non-linearity in
    the contribution of the terms. Let us consider the prevalence of mask usage, mobility,
    and population density. Independently each of these terms contributes to the socioeconomic
    risk. However, in combination, their effect is much stronger. A county with a
    large population density and high mobility would see a far greater impact of mask
    usage than a sparsely populated county or a county where people have tended to
    remain at home. These nonlinear effects are accounted for in our models by using
    sequential polynomial regressions with all cross terms.
