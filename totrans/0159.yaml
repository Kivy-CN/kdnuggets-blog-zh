    models (LLMs) that can write like humans are released every week. These models
    can generate highly creative content, and unfortunately, some students and professionals
    are misusing them to plagiarize.

    a wide range of AI-generated text, including text from the latest models like
    Bard (PalM 2), ChatGPT, GPT-4, and other open-source models. It is also fast and
    highlights the generated text for easy identification.'

    generated by ChatGPT. It is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces and provides fast and
    fairly accurate results. The detector is not as accurate as the OpenAI classifier,
    but it does provide two metrics (GLTR and PPL probability) that can help you determine
    if the content is generated by AI or not.

    a fairly accurate tool that can be used to detect text generated by ChatGPT, Bard,
    and other older versions of large language models (LLMs). However, it is not able
    to detect newer versions of LLMs. This is because the AI Detector works by analyzing
    the syntax and semantics of the text, and newer LLMs are better at generating
    text that is indistinguishable from human-written text.
