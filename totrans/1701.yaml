    specifically high-power semiconductors, as a technology development engineer,
    whose day job consists of dealing primarily with semiconductor physics, finite-element
    simulation of silicon fabrication process, or electronic circuit theory. There
    are, of course, some mathematics in this endeavor, but for better of worse, I
    don’t need to dabble in the kind of mathematics that will be necessary for a data
    scientist.

    IT engineers enthusiastic about learning/contributing to the exciting field of
    data science and machine learning/artificial intelligence. I am dabbling myself
    in this field to learn some tricks of the trade which I can apply to the domain
    of semiconductor device or process design. But when I started diving deep into
    these exciting subjects (by self-study), I discovered quickly that I don’t know/only
    have a rudimentary idea about/ forgot mostly what I studied in my undergraduate
    study some essential mathematics. [In this LinkedIn article, I ramble about it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whys-hows-studying-mathematics-mldata-science-preamble-sarkar)...

    still I felt incomplete in my preparation for having solid grasp over machine
    learning or data science techniques without having a refresher in some essential
    mathematics. Meaning no disrespect to an IT engineer, I must say that the very
    nature of his/her job and long training generally leave him/her distanced from
    the world of applied mathematics. (S)he may be dealing with lot of data and information
    on a daily basis but there may not be an emphasis on rigorous modeling of that
    data. Often, there is immense time pressure, and the emphasis is on ‘*use the
    data for your immediate need and move on*’ rather than on deep probing and scientific
    exploration of the same. Unfortunately, data science should always be about the
    science (*not* data), and following that thread, [certain tools and techniques
    become indispensable](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-machines-learn-a-practical-guide-203aae23cafb).

    by probing the underlying dynamics, rigorously estimating the quality of the data
    source, training one’s sense for identification of the hidden pattern from the
    stream of information, or understanding clearly the limitation of a model— are
    the hallmarks of sound scientific process.

    discipline. Or, one can imbibe them through high-quality graduate-level research
    work in similar field. Unfortunately, even a decade long career in traditional
    IT (devOps, database, or QA/testing) will fall short of rigorously imparting this
    kind of training. There is, simply, no need.

    the corresponding RDBMS is good enough to perform the extract-transform-load cycle
    and thereby generating value to the company for any IT engineer worth his/her
    salt. But what happens if someone drops by and starts asking weird question like
    “*is your artificially synthesized test data set random enough*” or “*how would
    you know if the next data point is within 3-sigma limit of the underlying distribution
    of your data*”? Or, even the occasional quipping from the next-cubicle computer
    science graduate/nerd that the computational load for *any meaningful mathematical
    operation with a table of data (aka a matrix) grows non-linearly with the size
    of table *i.e. number of rows and columns, can be exasperating and confusing.

    and probability cannot be overstated in a discussion about data science. Many
    practitioners in the field actually call machine learning nothing but statistical
    learning. I followed the widely known “[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)”
    while working on my first MOOC in machine learning and immediately realized the
    conceptual gaps I had in the subject. To plug those gaps, I started taking other
    MOOCs focused on basic statistics and probability and reading up/watching videos
    on related topics. The subject is vast and endless, and therefore focused planning
    is critical to cover most essential concepts. I am trying to list them as best
    as I can but I fear this is the area where I will fall short by most amount.

    some kind of estimation error subject to various constraints. That, right there,
    is an optimization problem, which is generally solved by [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) or
    similar techniques. On the other hand, it is always deeply satisfying and insightful
    experience to understand a computer algorithm’s time complexity as it becomes
    extremely important when the algorithm is applied to a large data set. In this
    era of big data, where a data scientist is routinely expected to extract, transform,
    and analyze billions of records, (s)he must be extremely careful about choosing
    the right algorithm as it can make all the difference between amazing performance
    or abject failure. General theory and properties of algorithms are best studied
    in a formal computer science course but to understand how their time complexity
    (i.e. how much time the algorithm will take to run for a given size of data) is
    analyzed and calculated, one must have rudimentary familiarity with mathematical
    concepts such as [*dynamic programming*](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/demystifying-dynamic-programming-3efafb8d4296) or *recurrence
    equations*. A familiarity with the techniqueof[*proof by mathematical induction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction) can
    be extremely helpful too.
