    age, and other factors is good for business. Diverse teams perform better and
    are more innovative. The technology industry, specifically, has been continuing
    to close the gender gap. [Deloitte Global](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2022/statistics-show-women-in-technology-are-facing-new-headwinds.html)
    predicts that large global technology firms, on average, will reach nearly 33
    percent overall female representation in their workforces in 2022, up slightly
    more than two percentage points from 2019\. The proportion of women in other industry
    roles will also presumably nudge up as well.

- en: Parul Bharadwaj, a seasoned technology professional based in Seattle, WA, who
    has worked with tech giants such as Amazon and DoorDash Inc., says she is very
    encouraged by opportunities that lie ahead for women as technology companies continue
    to renew their commitment to advancing gender diversity. Currently employed as
    a senior technical program manager at DoorDash, Bharadwaj leads engineering-wide
    initiatives such as data infrastructure, real-time streaming, rollouts, experimentation,
    analytics, data compliance, and governance. She said she finds inspiration at
    DoorDash, where female leaders such as Liangxiao Zhu, vice president of engineering;
    Sophia Vicent, senior director of engineering operations; Avani Nanavati, technical
    product director; and Varsha Dudani, director of engineering, display the potential
    for women to hold key decision-making positions. “I commend DoorDash for its efforts
    to expand women’s roles,” Bharadwaj said. “When hiring for leadership positions,
    research shows that the percentage of female candidates with required experience
    is low, but DoorDash is tactically addressing this problem by hiring women in
    management, thereby giving women the opportunity to gain experience today to lead
    as executives tomorrow.”

    reflects that hiring a more inclusive workforce across different areas is important.
    Bharadwaj says she is optimistic about change with these types of trends and notes
    that there are also prime examples of women who have succeeded in the industry
    outside of her company who continue to inspire her to remain passionate about
    her work. Some notable names include:'

    allow her to transform the future while shaping the present. That passion led
    her to digital technology. “The possibilities for innovation always seemed infinite,”
    she says. “It is a field at the forefront of our ever-evolving world. And it was
    this desire to make an impact, to maintain a competitive edge and to stay relevant
    that led me to this field.” She continues to see herself as someone who is part
    of enabling a massive growth of key online platforms that continue to make an
    impression on a global scale. “This not only gives me the opportunity to keep
    learning about new tools and technology and deliver better products and services,
    but also keeps me hungry to explore different ways of solving new problems.”

    being made throughout industry as well. According to Bharadwaj, “when you hire
    a diverse workforce, you must also be sensitive to and be able to recognize differences
    among those employees. Listening to people who have different life and career
    experiences reduces the likelihood of falling into group-think patterns.” It's
    just reality today. Innovative companies must have people at the table with different
    backgrounds. In this way, organizations harness excellence as they reshape the
    power [structure](https://hbr.org/2020/11/getting-serious-about-diversity-enough-already-with-the-business-case)
