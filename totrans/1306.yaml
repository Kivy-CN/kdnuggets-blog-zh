    some of them. Maybe they helped you think about problems from a computational
    standpoint. You were then able to make a transition to doing your own data science
    projects to try out implementing some other related concepts and skills.

    courses? I''ll bet most of them were taught using Python, with some significant
    minority instead using R. I will further bet that zero were taught using Julia.
    As you can likely glean from the title of this article and the course that it
    is spotlighting, Julia is the language utilized in this free offering from MIT.'

    your data science journey, or you are a skilled data scientist with advanced programming
    skills in a language other than Julia, this course is set up to be useful to you
    all. Add in the coursework focus on such a relevant topic, COVID-19, and this
    is guaranteed not to be a rehash of other intro to data science and programming
    courses you have come across.

    of data science, artificial intelligence, and mathematical models using the Julia
    programming language. This Spring 2020 version is a fast-tracked curriculum adaptation
    to focus on applications to COVID-19 responses.

    science concepts, and COVID-specific topics from week to week, the focus of which
    no doubt helps keep the material fresh and interest high. The courseware includes
    lecture slides, lecture videos, assignments, external resources, and Jupyter notebooks
    as applicable. The course's [Github repository](https://github.com/mitmath/6S083)
    houses the Jupyter notebooks and additional related resources.

    is nothing related to machine learning directly within. There is, however, a focus
    on how to solve problems using computational methods, which is a very useful skill
    to possess regardless of your exact programmatic role; it is definitely necessary
    for solving data science problems computationally. With this in mind, pairing
    this course with the high quality freely-available ebook, [Statistics with Julia:
    The Free eBook](/2020/09/statistics-julia-free-ebook.html), seems like a good
    path forward for those looking to learn Julia with a focus toward data science.'

    when I can find the time. When I *do* find that time, I will be sure to deeper
    investigate MIT's [Introduction to Computational Thinking with Julia](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s190-introduction-to-computational-thinking-with-julia-with-applications-to-modeling-the-covid-19-pandemic-spring-2020/)
    along with the above-mentioned free ebook Statistics with Julia. I don't see why
    you would do any different.
