    as a significant catalyst in bringing together scientists from multiple domains.
    We saw groundbreaking billion-atom molecular simulations to understand the Covid-19
    virus and its interaction with aerosols, augmented by AI methods. We saw novel
    AI methods able to solve complex scientific simulations such as turbulent fluid
    flows for the first time. We saw many hospitals join hands and collaboratively
    train AI patient-care models using federated learning platforms that preserved
    privacy. Language models got even bigger, but widespread awareness of issues around
    bias has led to deeper inspection of these models and development of few-shot
    and fine-tuning methods to reduce harm.

    discoveries and advancements this year, and I strongly invite you to check out

    in online retail and general online presence, and more and more enterprises are
    trying to operational data science and machine learning to improve online sales
    and operations. This has led to an shift from pure Data Science as a siloed activity
    to the drive to getting more ML/AI models in production, causing more demand for
    ML Engineering, ML Ops ,and data-centric AI. And while traditional machine learning
    methods (i.e XGBoost) still dominate the enterprise, more modern AI is finding
    its place, with vector-space search, graph neural networks, and, of course, computer
    vision applications. Causal machine learning has also picked up interest as enterprises
    need to know why ML methods work.

    but one thing has stood out to me the most: a steady decrease in hype-driven development.
    People have mostly come to accept that no, self-driving cars aren’t just around
    the corner, that AI won’t cure COVID, that this new model isn’t just one step
    short of general AI, that GPT-3 and bigger language models won’t magically solve
    every practical problem, and even that this one weird trick in the latest paper
    probably won’t help your production application.'

- en: There’s still plenty of excitement and enthusiasm, but it’s a lot more grounded,
    and it’s coming from the field having had much more time to mature. There are
    now a lot of people who’ve been working on AI and ML for several years, and the
    widespread acceptance of remote work throughout 2020 and 2021 has helped the right
    people find the right roles, to really get things done. In 2022, I think there
    will be much less writing that presents AI as this strange new alien thing. AI
    development is just software development, and it follows the same sort of trends.
    It’s mostly done in-house. Maintenance is a bigger expense than development. Tools
    are mostly open-source. And every project has its own challenges, so there are
    no silver bullets.

    in areas of transfer learning and representation learning especially with transformers
    becoming the breakout tool to understand, represent and build effective solutions
    on unstructured data including text, images as well as audio and video. We also
    saw a lot of advancements being made in areas of automating machine learning training
    using Low-code and Auto-ML tools and the continued rise of Explainable AI and
    MLOps.

- en: For 2022, I foresee the continued rise of encoder-decoder model architectures
    like transformers in solving tough multi-modal data problems and creating new
    benchmarks. We should also see more and more progress in areas of generative deep
    transfer learning and easy access to fine-tune these pre-trained models to solve
    diverse tasks using models even more powerful than GPT-3\. Generative deep learning
    should also be something to keep a close eye on, in terms of being used in new
    and novel areas like data generation and content creation. Finally, automation
    in machine learning, data-centric machine learning and MLOps is something which
    will continue at a steady pace with more efficient tools being created to help
    us build, deploy, monitor and maintain machine learning models faster.

    have sprout to comply, deploy, and monitor data-science-based solutions. Thanks
    also to this new branch of the data science life cycle, AI is now a mainstream
    discipline. It is not a research niche anymore, but more and more segments of

    auditing professionals, and similarly specialized professional profiles, all with
    different backgrounds and different degrees of knowledge in coding and AI algorithms,
    they all need to quickly develop a data solution within an unfamiliar scope –
    coding, big data, or AI. In this scenario, the ease of use of low code tools can
    become the key to the creation of sophisticated AI solutions for non-data-science
    professionals.
