    sources like sensors, social media data, excel spreadsheets, reviews, customer
    data, etc. There are many companies like Google, IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft helping
    businesses process big data by building Machine Learning APIs so that organizations
    can make the best use of the machine learning technology.

    for people who are not tech geeks or data science domain experts.Similar to how
    standard APIs help developers create applications, Machine Learning APIs make
    machine learning easy to use, for everyone. Machine Learning APIs abstract the
    complexities involved in creating and deploying machine learning models so that
    developers can focus on data munging, user experience, design, experimenting and
    delivering insights from data.

- en: In the early days, machine learning algorithms and technologies were mostly
    used by scientists, tech geeks or domain experts. However, several organizations
    are now using Machine Learning APIs to make these technologies available to the
    masses. Machine Learning APIs make it easy for developers to apply machine learning
    to a dataset so as to add predictive features to their applications. Machine Learning
    APIs provide an abstraction layer for developers to integrate machine learning
    in real world applications without having to worry about scaling the algorithms
    on their infrastructure and getting into the details of the machine learning algorithms.
    Machine Learning APIs require developers to focus on the two important aspects-

    predictive analytics so that they can get to know their customers better, understand
    their requirements and deliver products or services based on the past data trends,
    thereby initiating the selling process.There is an increasing percentage of real
    time consumer interactions through Machine Learning APIs – making them an ideal
    option for exposing real time predictive analytics to app developers.

    users by introducing novel and innovative features that can help users save time.
    This is the reason for the popularity of Machine Learning APIs in app developers.
    Some standard examples of these APIs include Smart Tagging, Product Recommendations,
    Priority Filtering, and Spam Filtering.
