    it often lays interesting pitfalls in front of us, sometimes causing misinterpretation
    of the results. One way of mitigating such risks, is to use a combination of more
    than one technique to reach an unambiguous conclusion. Today we will see how Kurtosis
    outputs can be supplemented by Skewness in tackling a very interesting challenge.

- en: In one of my previous [posts](/2018/03/descriptive-statistics-mighty-dwarf-data-science.html)
    we saw that Kurtosis is as a robust metric for detection of impulsive content
    within the data, however “an impulse” can have many faces and Kurtosis does not
    always seem to be drawing the full picture. In the case study described below
    I will show how to add one additional ‘brush’, that goes by the name of Skewness,
    to the image painting process.

- en: In the previous year ([previous post](/2018/03/descriptive-statistics-mighty-dwarf-data-science.html)),
    the Kurtosis was used to detect the impulse with a great success. Figure 1 shows
    the data for which the value of Kurtosis was 6.227 - clearly above 3 which is
    default for Gaussian noise. Impulsive content was detected, great! After some
    time however, a curious Business Analyst detected a somewhat puzzling case, depicted
    in Figure 2\. Even though the nature of the signal changed quite dramatically
    – the impulse has only the upward-facing part, Kurtosis returned precisely the
    same value, 6.227 (it actually took me half a dozen tries to synthesize such a
    signal).

    Figure 3 and 4 respectively. There is quite a noticeable change to be noticed.
    Figure 3 shows an almost identically symmetrical distribution, whereas Figure
    4 shows a shape which leans towards the left-hand side of the plot. Side note:
    despite the left-side leaning, such distribution shape is referred to as a right-skewed
    distribution, because we are really interested in the relative movement of the
    mean value. In our case it definitely shifted towards the right side, due to the
    presence of the prominent impulse.'

    He referred to the formula of Kurtosis (to be seen in [Eq. 1](/2018/03/descriptive-statistics-mighty-dwarf-data-science.html))
    and noted that all the powers in the equation are even numbers and so Kurtosis
    may be blind to the differentiation between the ‘above mean’ and ‘below mean’
    values. Sufficiently greater impulse in just one direction (as in Figure 2) may
    happily produce the same result as a symmetrical impulse (Figure 1).

- en: Skewness formula is virtually identical to formula of Kurtosis apart from the
    powers in numerator and denominator and now the distinction between the ‘above
    mean’ and ‘below mean’ values becomes possible. Skewness outputs values which
    are close to 0 for symmetrically distributed signals, values between 0 and 1 for
    right-skewed (aka positively skewed) signals, and values between 0 and -1 for
    right-skewed (aka negatively skewed) signals. The shapes of such distributions
    together with their corresponding relation of mean, median and mode are shown
    in Figure 5 (taken from [2]). When applied on signals from Figure 1 and 2, Skewness
    values are 0.06 and 0.58 respectively. At this point, the Business Analyst will
    always use Kurtosis with conjunction with Skewness values to be able to not only
    detect the presence of impulses but also determine the direction of their attack.
