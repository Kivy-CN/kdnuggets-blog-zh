- en: I started teaching myself data science in January 2020\. At that time, my only
    goal was to land a full-time job in the field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, although data scientists are paid very well, it takes a long time to
    climb the corporate ladder and build wealth with a 9–5 job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to this, I started looking for different ways to apply my data science skill
    set outside my corporate job. Since my full-time role is flexible and allows me
    to work remotely, I have around 3 to 4 hours of free time every day that I use
    to generate a side income.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have now successfully built multiple revenue streams outside my full-time
    job that provide me with approximately $3,000-$3,500 every month.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of these income streams are passive, which means that I earn without having
    to actively invest my time and effort into them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    aspire to become one, you can use some of these ideas to monetize your skill set.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I make a significant portion of my income from writing online. This includes
    creating data science tutorials, tips, and advice. I started blogging on Medium
    in May 2020.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After building an audience on the platform, I have been approached by employers
    to write freelance articles for their brands. In the past two years, I have created
    a variety of blog posts, tutorials, whitepapers, and SEO content for six different
    companies.

    In fact, according to Rachel Thomas, the co-founder of Fast.AI, you are best positioned
    to help someone one step behind you.

    You can easily simplify this and explain it to another beginner in the field —
    and would be able to do this better than an expert who has forgotten what it was
    like to be a beginner.

    LinkedIn profile and share your articles on the platform. Post regularly, join
    data science groups and connect with other professionals in the field.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When teaching myself data science, I took many online courses on Udemy, Coursera,
    and Datacamp. I would recommend these courses to co-workers and peers who wanted
    my advice on how to become a data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After a while, I realized that I could get paid for sharing my learning path
    with others. Affiliate marketing allows publishers to share courses with other
    people using an affiliate link. If someone purchases the program using their link,
    the publisher gets a small commission.

- en: Even before including affiliate links to my content, I would share learning
    material in almost every blog post I wrote. The only difference is that I now
    get paid for doing it. In fact, according to a poll from Affise, over 25% of affiliates
    make between $81,000 to $200,000 per year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While I earn only a fraction of this from affiliate marketing (around $100-$200
    a month every time I publish), it is a huge revenue driver for many bloggers and
    is definitely something you should consider adding to your content.
  prefs: []

    and benefitted from. You must also be transparent and clearly disclose the use
    of affiliate links to readers.

    but hear me out.

    In this role, I learned to apply data science techniques to create personalized
    customer targeting strategies and drive marketing success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wrote an article about applying data science techniques in the field of marketing,
    which caught the attention of an employer who was looking to hire a freelancer
    with the same set of skills I possessed. He reached out to me on LinkedIn, and
    I am now working with the company on a contract basis.

    familiar with some of the biggest challenges faced in the industry. I also know
    how to use data to solve them.
  prefs: []

    of skills that I have, which made me a strong contender for this freelance job.
  prefs: []

    when starting out. This can be finance, marketing, healthcare, insurance, or anything
    else you enjoy doing.
  prefs: []

    can do this in a specific industry, you have a competitive edge over other data
    scientists.

    fit for someone without domain experience, even if they had a Master’s degree
    or Ph.D. in data science.

  prefs: []

    through the platform. I have worked with other marketing data scientists, many
    of whom are more experienced and know the field better than I do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    blog posts and social media presence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don’t have the time to write articles about your work, I suggest that
    you at least create a portfolio website that contains a summary of your skill
    set. Include a link to the site on LinkedIn and other social media platforms so
    potential employers can easily find you when hiring for open positions.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have conducted workshops on topics like data collection and analytics to teach
    non-technical students to work with data. This involved hours of preparation,
    since I had to familiarize myself with every concept I was teaching and ensure
    that I wasn’t making any mistakes.
  prefs: []

    of the subject and dramatically improved my ability to break down complex concepts
    to beginners in the field.

    an expert in the field. However, I have learned a lot during this time and can
    teach it to a group of people who will benefit from learning my skill set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I am well-positioned to teach data literacy skills to marketers. I can also teach
    data scientists about marketing analytics so they can gain domain knowledge and
    potentially land a job in the industry.
  prefs: []

    can earn a side income from sharing what you know with others. Often, this works
    best when you combine a unique set of skills that not many people have.

    since similar programs are abundant on the Internet. However, an “Introduction
    to Python for Finance” course is more specialized and likely to attract a group
    of viewers who are interested in predicting the stock market.
