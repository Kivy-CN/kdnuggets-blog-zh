    that is used for classification problems and is based on the concept of probability.
    It is used when the dependent variable (target) is categorical.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is widely used when the classification problem at hand is binary; true or
    false, yes or no, etc. For example, it can be used to predict whether an email
    is spam (1) or not (0).

    to probabilities. The function has the ability to map any real value into another
    value within a range of 0 and 1.

- en: The rule is that the value of the logistic regression must be between 0 and
    1\. Due to the limitations of it not being able to go beyond the value 1, on a
    graph it forms a curve in the form of an "S". This is an easy way to identify
    the Sigmoid function or the logistic function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In regards to Logistic Regression, the concept used is the threshold value.
    The threshold values help to define the probability of either 0 or 1\. For example,
    values above the threshold value tend to 1, and a value below the threshold value
    tends to 0.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linear Regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between dependent
    and independent variables. It uses the line of best fit that describes two or
    more variables. The aim of Linear Regression is to accurately predict the output
    for the continuous dependent variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is dependent on other factors, therefore the output of Logistic Regression always
    lies between 0 and 1.

    x and y.

    a probability. We can then move onto training the model. The model is trained
    for 300 epochs and The partial derivatives are calculated at each of these 300
    epochs and the weights are updated.

    this is a classification task, we will need to convert it into a binary value.
    In order to do this, we need to select a threshold. In this example, we will select
    the threshold 0.5 which means all the predicted values above 0.5 will be treated
    as 1 and everything below 0.5 will be treated as 0.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Logistic Regression is a widely used technique due to it being very efficient
    and not requiring a lot of computational resources. Logistic regression works
    more efficiently when you remove variables that have no or little relation to
    the output variable. Therefore, feature engineering is an important element in
    the performance of Logistic Regression.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Logistic Regression is very good for classification tasks, however, it is not
    one of the most powerful algorithms out there. It can be easily outperformed by
    other more complex algorithms, however it is easy and simple to work with. However,
    due to its simplicity, it can be used as a good baseline to compare with the performance
    of other more complex algorithms.
