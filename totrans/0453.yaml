- en: Few people enjoy public speaking. However, it is an essential skill in almost
    any job. Data science is no exception to this. As a data scientist, you will have
    to present your ideas and findings to stakeholders, which is why you often have
    to give presentations when interviewing for a data scientist position.

    you are a capable data scientist. Data scientists have to be sellers that can
    drive conversations to convince stakeholders to buy into their suggestions and
    stories. The presentation part of an interview is where you demonstrate your ability
    to be a driver and not just a supporter.

    We will go over both what type of information to include in presentations and
    how to present those things in a compelling manner. And if you prefer watching

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first tip is to **focus on *your *impact**. Projects are usually a team
    effort, involving more than just data scientists. It takes a lot of collaboration
    and teamwork to successfully complete a project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite this reality, this is not what interviewers tend to care about when
    you present a project. They are interested in *you, not* the rest of the team.
    Therefore you want to focus on your role and impact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To convey your impact clearly, you should **describe it in measurable terms**.
    Use metrics and numbers to explain your achievements on the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best metrics are those that** show the effect you had on the business**.
    This includes things like increasing revenue, customer acquisition, customer retention,
    etc. If you know what impact your work had on a business metric, this is an ideal
    way to illustrate your impact in a presentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, sometimes connecting your work to a direct impact on the business is
    very difficult. It may be that the scope of the project was not large enough or
    that the project is only indirectly affecting a business metric.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this is the case, you still want to describe your impact using metrics that
    the interviewer can easily understand. You can talk about things like improving
    team efficiency and productivity by building data pipelines, or about how a tool
    you built or methodology you developed was adopted by multiple teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although these things do not say exactly what impact you have on the business,
    it is clear that you are positively impacting the overall company. Improving team
    productivity is sure to lead to improved business metrics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When describing your impact, **avoid details that do not clearly explain how
    you helped the business**. For example, simply saying that you improved model
    performance is not helpful for an interviewer. It is unclear exactly how that
    benefits the company. Stick with metrics that are clear to someone without a technical
    background, and if you have them, business metrics are best.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This tip about focusing on your impact does not only apply to presentations.
    When describing past projects in an interview, the impact is also very important.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our next tip is to **use your best stuff**. This tip might seem painfully obvious
    at first. Of course, you want to present your best project! However, what exactly
    do we mean by best? It can be tempting to present a project that you feel was
    the most successful, but your most successful project is often also an easy project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I say present your best stuff, I am more so referring to the best stuff
    about you rather than the most successful project. Talking about a project with **challenges** gives
    you far more opportunities to display your skill, thoughtfulness, and uniqueness
    as a candidate. Challenging projects also tend to be more interesting, so it is
    much easier to capture the interviewer’s attention.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Challenges are not the only thing that make a project your best. You also want
    a project where you were **heavily involved**. Pick a project where you feel comfortable
    highlighting your actions in the various steps of the process. Explain things
    like the project design and implementation feasibility to demonstrate that you
    understand your job and its implications. This shows that you can **drive projects** because
    you understand how the entire thing works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So when you pick a project to present, choose one that captures you at your
    best. This often means choosing to talk about a project that had some **problems
    and obstacles**. This idea leads us to our third tip: list the limitations of
    the project.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: List the Limitations
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be tempting to skip or skim over the issues and limitations that arose
    during a project. However, the limitations you faced on a particular project are
    not something that you want to bypass in a presentation, specifically when discussing
    the modeling method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fact is that simply knowing how to use a modeling method is not enough.
    Anyone can learn to do that. To impress interviewers, you need to demonstrate
    a knowledge of the method’s advantages and limitations in your application. Show
    awareness about what was **not ideal** in your situation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you might have faced a limitation with data. Perhaps they were
    problems with data collection, and your team did not have enough data to do analysis
    or modeling. To overcome this limitation, you might have had to do some research
    to find an external data source.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What this example shows is that listing the limitations gives you a chance to
    discuss how you improved or plan to improve. Thus, awareness of limitations indicates
    a capacity for growth and demonstrates your **problem-solving capability**. It
    shows that you can identify weaknesses in a plan and work to mitigate them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first three tips should help you decide which project to talk about, but
    now that you have picked a project, how do you prepare to present it? Everyone’s
    method differs, but there is one thing that I suggest everyone do. The fourth
    tip is to think** through the technical details** of the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You likely won’t have time to explain every technical aspect of a project, but
    you want to ensure that you have a thorough understanding of everything you do
    choose to talk about. You will often be asked **follow-up questions** that will
    require a thorough understanding of the technical details of the project.

    what our tips have focused on: what type of project to select and what aspects
    of that project to focus on in your presentation.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, having fantastic content is not the only thing that makes a presentation
    successful. The interviewer will also be evaluating **the way you handle yourself** when
    giving a presentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although you want to appear as someone you can sell their ideas and drive conversation,
    you do not want to come across as arrogant or egotistical. Part of being a good
    presenter is demonstrating that you are a good listener. No one wants to work
    with a coworker who refuses to listen to others and consider different perspectives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, when giving a presentation it is important to show an** openness
    to questions and suggestions.** Listen to different opinions, even those that
    disagree with your own, and take the time to analyze them. You can then either
    persuade your audience of your own view or admit your limitations in the matter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many times this simply means admitting that someone has a good question and
    thinking of a solution. Do not dismiss others’ opinions and concerns because this
    implies that you would be a poor coworker. During a presentation, you should carry
    yourself in a way that shows confidence and capability while also demonstrating
    that you value differing perspectives.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What all of these tips show is that a presentation in an interview is less about
    presenting a project and more about presenting yourself as a data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To show that you are a capable data scientist, your presentation should go beyond
    simply explaining the bare facts of the project. You want to demonstrate your
    impact, your ability to problem-solve, your technical skills and knowledge, and
    your ability to behave professionally and drive the conversation.
