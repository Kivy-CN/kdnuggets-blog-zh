- en: The lack of women in STEM fields – science, technology, engineering, and math
    – fields is well documented, and those figures can be discouraging. For instance,
    women made up 27% of people employed in computer and mathematical occupations
    in 1960\. But instead of growing over several decades, as many more women participated
    in the workforce overall, that number had declined to 26% by 2013, according to
    a [2015 analysis of US Census data](http://www.aauw.org/research/solving-the-equation/).
