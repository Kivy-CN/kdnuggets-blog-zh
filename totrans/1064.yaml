    and my end goal was to build an end-to-end machine learning system. Just like
    other curious heads, I signed up for the MLOps event by [Noah Gift](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahgift/).
    He was promoting his book and tutorial on Coursera. I was just surprised by how
    I never learned command-line tools and how they are essential for automation.
    During the Q&A session, I told him about my obsession, and he guided me to take
    his mini-course on DataCamp: [Command Line Automation in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/command-line-automation-in-python).
    This course gave me a new perspective about data pipelines, editing data, creating
    scripts, and how a single line of code on a terminal can produce the same results
    as 15 lines of code on Python. So, I kept looking for the best material on the
    command line, and then I found [Data Science at the Command Line](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Command-Line-Explore-dp-1492087912/dp/1492087912)
    by [Jeroen Janssens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroenjanssens/).'

    perform all of the tasks related to data science. This book is for all data professionals,
    engineers, system administrators, and researchers. The free eBook is interactive,
    and It took me no time to go through all of the core topics. I have read epubs,
    pdfs, and hard copy, but this style of reading books is next level. It’s like
    reading the documentation of your favorite library but better.

    extract the data. Then perform data clearing and manipulation operations. After
    that, you will learn data analysis and visualization using **rush**. You will
    also learn to manage data science workflow, create parallel pipelines, and build
    machine learning models (regression, classification). Apart from core topics,
    you will also learn on how Unix power tools will make you more productive in running
    quick data analysis.

    can use the **rush** to plot all kinds of graphs. I have never seen any machine
    learning engineer preprocessing the data, creating models, and evaluating the
    results using command-line tools. When I first read about the modeling section,
    I was skeptical, I knew they must be running Python or R scripts to train, but
    to my surprise, the author used **vw** to train and run evaluation.

    Nothing is different about it. It’s just we are doing all of this with a single
    line of the script. In Python, we have to write at least 20-30 lines to get similar
    results.

    will reduce the time to run any computational process. It will allow you to parallelize
    and distribute commands and pipelines. Best thing about **parallel** is that you
    don’t have to modify the current tools in order to run a parallel task.

- en: Data science is an exciting field, and command-line tools make it more interesting
    as it takes away complexity and provides you with new and easy ways to perform
    the task with a single line of code. The book perfectly explains the need for
    these power tools and how we can leverage them to improve the current data science
    workflow. If you have made up your mind on reading this book, then I will suggest
    that you learn by writing the scripts and testing them on your own. The book also
    guides you to pull and run a docker image so that you don’t have to install the
    Unix power tools manually.
