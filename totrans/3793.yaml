    the interview, coding interviews are often hard to crack—especially if you haven’t
    been practicing for a while. And having a rock solid foundation in data structures
    and algorithms is necessary.
  prefs: []

- en: Even if you don't have a CS degree, taking university-level courses in programming,
    data structures, and algorithms will help you prepare for coding interviews. Because
    learning the fundamentals followed by several weeks of deliberate practice are
    both required for cracking coding interviews.

    concepts. And you may find some university courses difficult to follow along.
    So this is a good first course if you haven't previously taken a course in data
    structures in algorithms.
