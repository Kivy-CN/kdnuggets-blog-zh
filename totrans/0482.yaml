    priding itself on making data-driven decisions, data is at everyone’s fingertips.
    Data Science is becoming a hotter and hotter field by the day. You are here reading
    this probably because you are enthusiastic about data and want to be able to develop
    expertise in the field. With all the boot camps and online classes nowadays, everyone
    can *feel* *like* a data expert in months or even weeks; but being a truly helpful,
    likable, and credible “data partner” to co-workers and other stakeholders takes
    more than just familiarity with SQL and Python and basic stats knowledge.

    and those who truly understand how to handle data and be helpful data partners.
    I have observed people who demonstrate behaviors that amount to no less than waving
    your arms in the air and screaming, “I’m new to this, I have no idea what I’m
    doing…”. And I had done most of these things myself when I first started as a
    data scientist. These behaviors can diminish your credibility as a data partner
    quickly and make people question your understanding of the subject matter. So
    hopefully, I can provide some advice for what NOT to do and what to do instead,
    so you don’t become THAT data person.

    on 30 data points, and we believe it’s due to…” I die a little whenever I hear
    people make statements like the one above. When it comes to trend analysis and
    generating insights, the sample size is always the number one thing to consider.
    Unless it’s a focus group with people that are representative of your customer
    base (I even have doubts about survey results from focus groups, but that’s another
    topic), 30 data points usually won’t give you any robust insights.

    datasets? Yes, coming up with theories for why these “trends” are happening. I
    have seen people come up with all sorts of wild theories to explain why the results
    from tiny datasets are “counter-intuitive”; they lose their credibility along
    with most of the audience in the process when the real explanation is simple…
    it’s simply noise.

    is small, focus on setting up structures to collect more data with better quality
    going forward to enable those analyses in the future. If you REALLY want to have
    some insights coming out of the small sample, caveat your finding with the lack
    of sample quantity and add a confidence interval to metrics that you report.'

- en: There are no perfect datasets out there; anyone who tells you otherwise is either
    lying or doesn’t know better. So as a data expert, you should know better than
    trusting data quality at face value. EVERY SINGLE PIECE of data you query and
    analyze needs to be quality checked — make sure tables are ACTUALLY deduped as
    they should be, check that timestamps are in the timezone you THINK they are,
    and so on. Not performing QC on the data before using it can cause unintended
    results and misleading insights and make people doubt your ability to deal with
    complicated data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Try this instead: **Develop a QC framework (i.e., a list of tests you perform)
    and go through it every time you work with a new dataset. For example, check for
    (unexpected) duplicates; if you expect the data set in question to have one row
    per customer order, write a quick query to group by order id and count the number
    of rows — you will be surprised how many “order-level” tables have 1,000 records
    for some order ids. Always, always, always sanity-check your work, and double
    sanity-check with your stakeholders and subject matter experts.'

- en: I still remember the excitement after I learned about fancy models like the
    Random Forest or XGBoost; when you have a hammer, especially a shiny cool one,
    everything looks like a nail. But in reality, unless you are an ML engineer, you
    rarely need 10-layer neural networks in your day-to-day data work. Using fancy
    ML models when a simple linear regression suffices is not only inefficient but
    also counter-productive. As I mentioned in my article about [data science lessons
    I learned from working at McKinsey](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-lessons-mckinsey-taught-me-that-will-make-you-a-better-data-scientist-66cd9cc16aba),
    making a business impact is the number one goal when it comes to working as a
    data scientist in the industry, not showing off how much ML knowledge you have.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This one is very common among people who have just entered the data world. Similar
    to having the tendency to over-engineer things out of excitement about the new
    modeling skills, a lot of new data practitioners like to use all the new concepts
    and new words they learned whenever possible. When communicating, we tend to make
    up for our lack of understanding of things with complexity — the more buzz words
    a person uses when talking about ML and analytics, the less analytics he/she usually
    knows. A seasoned data practitioner should be able to explain the methodology
    and analytical details in plain English; if someone’s explanation of data work
    is as hard to understand as reading a Wikipedia page, it’s probably because they
    just read about it on Wikipedia too.

    try to understand it to the point that you can easily explain it to your friends
    who are not data scientists… in plain English. This level of understanding will
    also help you decide when to apply the fancy but complicated approach and when
    to use the good old-fashioned linear regression.'

    3 and 4 above but carry their overzealousness so far as to create data pet projects
    at work that nobody appreciates but themselves. Don’t get me wrong, I think all
    enthusiasm in data should be encouraged, and pet projects are fun and helpful
    in developing skills… just not at your day job, where a business is counting on
    you to use data products to drive impact.

    you build but wants to instead focus on the accuracy of the data behind the visualizations
    and insights from them. Similarly, truly understand the audience and use case;
    for example, you would spend more time on a polished and simple user interface
