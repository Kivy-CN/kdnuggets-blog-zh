    as the key issues facing data science projects. This always puzzles me as this
    is not our lived experience - not what we see when we work with Fortune 500 companies
    adopting predictive analytics, machine learning, or AI. But I think I have figured
    it out. The problem is as follows:'

    with nearly twice as many projects reporting it as a problem as the next one.

    what the business need, that will not solve a true business problem, or that is
    poorly designed to fit into the business context.

    decision making to take advantage of the analytic by changing the decisions made
    and actions taken.

    to start and end with the **business**. That means starting with a **business **problem
    - a business decision that the business wants to improve - and ending with that
    problem being solved - the **business **behaves differently (better). If that's
    your focus, then your problem is not data but problem definition and operationalization
    - making the analytic work IRL.
