- en: When I got into Data Science and Machine Learning, anything related to math
    and statistics was something I had visited for the last time around 10 years ago,
    and I reckon that’s probably why I found it so hard at first. It took me lots
    of hours of reading and watching videos to get some ground understanding of how
    things happen for a lot of the tools we daily use in the industry. However, it
    got to a point where I felt the need for developing a solid understanding of what
    was happening underneath all those “imports” and “fits” I was doing on my Jupyter
    Notebook. So I decided it was time to wipe the dust off my math knowledge.

    coming from business and being in an industry full of professionals from engineering,
    statistics, physics, and other exact sciences, I know there are LOTS of things
    to learn in the world of Data Science. But you know what? Technologies and languages
    might come and go, but the mathematical background of the field is going to remain.

    and take advantage of some of all this spare time we have been given thanks to
    this unfortunate situation. Since, you know, you should be staying at home these
    days.

    find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics — stuff you may have
    studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context,
    or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used
    in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you
    up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding,
    and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.*'

    enrolling, just select the option to audit the course.'
