  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrary to popular belief, AI isn't intelligent at all. Most people nowadays
    do think that AI-powered models are intelligent indeed. This might be led by the
    inclusion of the term “intelligence” within the name “artificial intelligence”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intelligence is a trait unique to living organisms defined as the ability to
    acquire and apply knowledge and skills. This means that intelligence allows living
    organisms to interact with their surroundings, and thus, learn how to survive.

    of this natural intelligence. Most AI applications we interact with, especially
    in business and online platforms, rely on machine learning.

    version, while Google’s Palma stands at 540 billion features and OpenAI’s latest

    to better performance.

    determinants of a model's performance and accuracy. This has already been proved
    with the [Alpaca experiment by Stanford](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html)
    where a simple 7 billion features powered Llama-based LLM could tie the astonishing

    pronounced biases in associating gender with certain professions and emotions](https://news.mit.edu/2023/large-language-models-are-biased-can-logic-help-save-them-0303).
    For example, roles such as flight attendant, or secretary were mainly tied to
