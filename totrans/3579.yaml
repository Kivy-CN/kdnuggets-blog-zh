- en: The success of machine learning (ML) across many domains has brought with it
    a new set of challenges – specifically the need to continuously train and evaluate
    models and continuously check for drift in training data. Continuous integration
    and deployment (CI/CD) is at the core of any successful software engineering project
    and is often referred as DevOps. DevOps helps streamline code evolution, enables
    various testing frameworks, and provides flexibility for enabling selective deployment
    to various deployment servers (dev, staging, prod, etc.).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new challenges associated with ML have expanded the traditional scope of
    CI/CD to also include what is now commonly referred as Continuous Training (CT),
    a term first [introduced by Google](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning#mlops_level_1_ml_pipeline_automation).
    Continuous training requires ML models to be continuously trained on new datasets
    and evaluated for expectations before being deployed to production, as well as
    enabling many more ML specific features. Today, within a machine learning context,
    DevOps is becoming known as MLOps and includes CI, CT & CD.

    Here are the three most important MLOps principles.
  prefs: []

    continuous training, continuous development, continuous integration or anything
    that is continuously evolving/changing.'

    and collect whatever happens, similar to the processes in a science experiment.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Jigsaw Approach:** Any MLOps framework should support pluggable components.
    However, it’s important to strike the right balance: too much pluggability causes
    compatibility issues, whereas too little restricts the usage.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a good MLOps framework.

    the same results repeatedly to validate the performance.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Versioning:** Maintain versioning from all directions, including: data, code,
    models and configs. One way to perform ‘data-model-code’ versioning is to using
    version control tools like GitHub.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Pipelining:** Although Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based pipelines are often
    used in non-ML scenarios (ex -Airflow), ML brings its own pipelining requirements
    to enable continuous training. Reusability of pipeline components for train and
    predict ensures consistency in feature extraction and reduces data processing
    errors.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Orchestration & Deployment:** ML model training requires a distributed framework
    of machines involving GPUs and therefore, executing a pipeline in the cloud is
    an inherent part of the ML training cycle. Model deployment based on various conditions
    (metric, environment etc.) brings unique challenges in machine learning.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Flexibility:** Enable flexibility for choosing data sources, selecting a
    cloud provider and deciding upon different tools (data analysis, monitoring, ML
    frameworks, etc.) Flexibility can be achieved by providing an option for plugins
    to external tools and/or offering the capability to define custom components. 
    A flexible orchestration & deployment component ensures cloud agnostic pipeline
    execution and ML service.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Experiment Tracking:** Unique to ML, experimentation is an implicit part
    of any project. After multiple rounds of experimentation (i.e. experimentation
    with architecture or hyper-parameters in the architecture), an ML model gets matured.
    Keeping a log of each experiment for future reference is essential to ML. Experiment
    tracking tools can be used to ensure code and model versioning and DVC like tools
    ensure code-data versioning.'

- en: 'In the excitement of creating ML models, some specific ML hygiene is often
    missed: such as initial data analysis or hyperparameter tuning or pre-/post- processing. 
    In many cases, there is a lack of an ML production mindset from the beginning
    of the project, which leads to surprises (memory issues, budget overflow etc.)
    at later stages of the project, especially during production time, resulting in
    re-modeling and delayed time-to-market. But using an MLOps framework from the
    beginning of a ML project addresses production considerations early on and enforces
    a systematic approach to solving machine learning problems such as data analysis,
    experiment tracking etc.'

- en: An MLOps also makes it possible to be production-ready at any given point of
    time. This is often crucial for startups when there is a requirement for shorter
    time-to-market. With MLOps providing flexibility in terms of orchestration & deployment,
    production readiness can be achieved by pre-defining orchestrators (ex- github
    action) or deployers (ex- MLflow, KServe etc.) which are part of MLOps pipelining.

- en: Cloud service providers like Google, Amazon, Azure provide their own MLOps frameworks
    that can be used in their own platform or as part of existing machine learning
    frameworks (TFX pipelining as part of Tensorflow framework). These MLOps frameworks
    are easy to use and exhaustive in their functionality.

- en: Using an MLOps framework from a cloud service provider restricts an organization
    to use MLOps in their environment. For many organizations this becomes a big restriction
    as usage of cloud service depends on what their customer wants. In many cases,
    one needs an MLOps framework that provides flexibility in terms of choosing a
    cloud provider and at the same time, has most of the functionalities of MLOps.

- en: Open-source MLOps frameworks come in handy for such scenarios.  ZenML, MLRun,
    Kedro, Metaflow are some of well-known open-source MLOps frameworks widely used
    with their [own pros and cons](https://neptune.ai/blog/best-workflow-and-pipeline-orchestration-tools).
    They all provide good flexibility in terms of choosing cloud providers, orchestration/deployment
    and ML tools as part of their pipeline. Selecting of any of these open source
    frameworks depends on the specific MLOps requirements. However, all these frameworks
    are generic enough to cater to wide range of requirements.

    different domains: data engineers, machine learning engineers, infrastructure
    engineers as well as others. In the future we can expect MLOps to become low-code,
    similar to what we’ve seen within DevOps today. Startups in particular should
