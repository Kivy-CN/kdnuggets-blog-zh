- en: Oracle Exadata is the most deployed high-end OLTP system and it has been extended
    with new OLAP capabilities with an in-memory columnar capability. Exadata is fully
    ACID compliant with all isolation levels, and Oracle uses a hybrid representation
    where data is inserted in tuples (row-based) and then converted to in-memory columnar
    representations. Oracle is strictly a scale-up engineered solution with excellent
    performance but at a very high cost. This system is not open source and Oracle
    does offer it in a database-as-a-service model.

- en: MemSQL is primarily used for analytical workloads. It is ACID compliant and
    handles transactional updates, but these are not optimized for large-scale real-time
    OLTP workloads. MemSQL is not typically used to power real-time, concurrent applications.
    MemSQL uses a hybrid representation where data is inserted in tuples (row-based)
    and then converted to columnar. MemSQL is a scale-out solution typically deployed
    on commodity clusters, and it distributes computation across the cluster and can
    scale. This system is not open source and is not available through a DBaaS offering.

- en: Splice Machine is a fully ACID compliant MVCC, capable of powering applications
    including native Oracle PL/SQL. OLAP computation takes place on Apache Spark while
    transactional queries take place on Apache HBase. Native Data is persisted in
    Apache HBase. Data can also be persisted in external Parquet and ORC columnar
    files. Splice Machine is a scale-out solution whose cost-based optimizer distributes
    work via Apache Spark or Apache HBase. This system is open source and will be
    available as a DBaaS within the first quarter of 2017.

- en: Apache Hive is primarily used for analytical workloads. It is ACID compliant
    and handles transactional updates, but these are not optimized for large-scale
    real-time OLTP workloads. Hive is not typically used to power real-time, concurrent
    applications. One Hive application can add rows while another reads from the same
    partition without interfering with each other. This system uses native file-based
    storage on the Hadoop File System. Older systems stored raw data on HDFS but newer
    systems use Apache Parquet or ORC columnar formats. These columnar storage systems
    compress data and perform very well. Hive is a scale-out solution typically deployed
    on commodity clusters. It relies on the Hadoop file system and Map-Reduce computations.
    This system is open source and is available as a DBaaS through Quoble, Amazon
    and Google.

- en: Apache HAWQ is primarily used for analytical workloads. It is ACID compliant
    and handles transactional updates but these are not optimized for large-scale
    real-time OLTP workloads. HAWQ is not typically used to power real-time, concurrent
    applications. HAWQ stores data in multiple formats on HDFS including Apache Parquet.
    HAWQ is a scale-out solution typically deployed on commodity clusters. It distributes
    computation across the cluster and can scale. This system is open source and is
    available as a service through Pivotal.

- en: Apache Trafodion is a SQL-on-HBase solution intended to support full OLTP workloads
    with a two-phase commit protocol. Apache Trafodion uses HBase as a persistent
    row-based store. Apache Trafodion is a scale-out solution that distributes work
    across a cluster of execution agents that distribute work across HBase region
    servers. This system is open source but is not available as a DBaaS.

- en: Apache Kudu/Impala is primarily used for analytical workloads. It is ACID compliant
    and handles transactional updates but these are not optimized for large-scale
    real-time OLTP workloads. Kudu is not typically used to power real-time, concurrent
    applications. Apache Kudu is a hybrid key-value store that has both a tuple-based
    and columnar store. Kudu uses a hybrid representation where data is inserted in
    tuples in a write-optimized LSM-Tree and then converted to columnar using Apache
    Parquet. The Apache Kudu/Impala Systems are scale-out systems that leverage parallel
    computation across the cluster and vectorize instructions as much as possible.
    This system is open source but is not available as a DBaaS.

- en: HTAP systems combine transactional and analytical capabilities. Most HTAP systems
    are able to accept transactional updates and analyze, while some HTAP systems
    can actually power concurrent applications while performing analytics. The diversity
    between systems continues as some HTAP systems are scale-up, expensive solutions
    while others are scale-out less expensive solutions and some are open source and
    some are proprietary. Organizations can balance these requirements to scale traditional
    applications and make them intelligent.

    industry veteran. Monte’s early career was spent with the NASA Ames Research Center
    as the Deputy Chief of the Artificial Intelligence Branch, where he won the prestigious
    Space Act Award for his work on the Space Shuttle program. Monte then founded
    and was CEO of Red Pepper Software, a leading supply chain optimization company,
    which merged in 1996 with PeopleSoft, where he was VP and General Manager, Manufacturing
    Business Unit. In 1998, Monte was the founder and CEO of Blue Martini Software
    – the leader in e-commerce and multi-channel systems for retailers. Blue Martini
    went public on NASDAQ in one of the most successful IPOs of 2000, and is now part
    of JDA. Following Blue Martini, he was the chairman of SeeSaw Networks, a digital,
    place-based media company. Monte is also the co-author of Intelligent Scheduling
    and has published articles in the Harvard Business Review and various computer
    science journals and conference proceedings. Zweben currently serves as Chairman
    of Rocket Fuel Inc. as well as on the Dean’s Advisory Board for Carnegie-Mellon’s
    School of Computer Science.'
