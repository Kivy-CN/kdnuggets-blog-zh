    on its own, making decisions based on the data it is given. Although AI has many
    different definitions, in general, it can be summarized as a process of making
    a computer system "smart"—able to comprehend difficult tasks and execute complex
    commands.

    to automate tasks that are time-consuming or exhausting for humans to do. For
    example, in retail, AI can track inventory levels and predict customer demand,
    and this information can then be used to streamline the supply chain and improve
    stock management. In healthcare, AI can process and interpret medical images,
    which can help diagnose diseases and plan treatments.
