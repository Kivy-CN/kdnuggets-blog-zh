- en: New technological advancement is always attention-grabbing. Data science and
    its applications have been the front-runner of attention for years. 2023 started
    strong with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) releasing an AI-based chatbot,
    ChatGPT. The release of ChatGPT has been thunderous, with everyone using it in
    different ways, challenging the limits of AI and the chatbot itself. It even triggered
    other companies like Notion to build better chatbots to challenge and overcome
    ChatBGT.

- en: Not just companies but also many data scientists, both novices and experts,
    played with the idea of building their own version of ChatGPT to gain more knowledge
    and experience in building AI-based chatbots or to challenge and grow their skills.
    You reading this article means you also thought about making a ChatGPT-like chatbot
    or are just curious about what it takes to build such a tool.

- en: This article will review the knowledge you need to know to build your version
    of ChatGPT. But before we jump into the technical knowledge we need to develop
    a chatbot, let's talk briefly about what it takes to build a chatbot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since we are considering building a ChatBGT-like chatbot, which is a web-based
    chatbot, we will need to consider two parts when designing and building the chatbot.
    The front end (how the chatbot looks), what the user will interact with, and the
    core of the chatbot (the backend), or what we will call the brains of the chatbot.

    an AI-based chatbot that looks good and functions well. Then, we suggest a course
    for each element to get you all the tools you need to build your ChatGPT.

    then how it looks will matter little. Here is where knowing the basics of UX (User
    experience) comes in handy. UX is the art of designing applications that are easy
    to navigate and use, hence providing a better experience for anyone using that
    app. For example, if we want to build a good chatbot, it must look good and be
    easy and intuitive. CalArts also offers [a course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals?specialization=ui-ux-design)
    to help you gain the knowledge you need to make a chatbot with good UX.

    We want to build an AI-based chatbot, so we must master the basics of data science,
    programming, and AI. We can divide the brains of ChatGPT into two sections, the
    basics of data science and the core of chatbots. Now let’s look at each of those
    in a bit of detail.

    the second type is often used to deal with the users' problems. Those are usually
    the support bots on most websites. Finally, the third type simulates and predicts
    how the user may interact with the UI. Looking closely at ChatGPT, we will notice
    it's a mix of those three types. To build an AI-based chatbot, we need to know
    the basics of natural language processing (NLP), AI, and the fundamentals of building
    a chatbot.
