- en: One of the most popular questions in the data science field, apart from ‘What
    is data science?’, is ‘How do I learn data science?’. It’s not just a question
    that comes from those who are new to data science, but also from those who have
    already been around for some time. The road to the “sexiest job of the 21st Century”
    or the “best job of the year” 2016 is clearly not as smooth or straightforward
    as one would think.

    can find a lot of opinions and advice from seasoned veterans on the Internet,
    but this jungle of information is not making things easier for beginners. This
    post is meant to present a general overview of the eight steps that you need to
    go through to learn data science.

    or attempts at definitions around, and it doesn’t need to surprise that some of
    these have been visually represented. The most significant start of this trend
    or tradition was in 2010, when Drew Conway [presented a Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram)
    to define the concept “data science”. In the center of the picture is data science
    and it is the result of the combination of hacking skills, mathematics and statistics
    knowledge and substantive expertise.

- en: To make a long story short, in 2016 we got a slightly different image of what
    data science is. Matthew Mayo [blogged](/2016/03/data-science-puzzle-explained.html)
    a visual representation made by Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro. There are a lot of
    things that are different. Two things that stand out are the fact that data science
    is no longer in the center of the picture and that the approach to defining data
    science is different. Data science is now defined through its relation to other
    disciplines, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep
    Learning, Big Data (BD) and Data Mining (DM). Data science is at the crossing
    of AI, ML and BD and has an intrinsic relation with DM, as it is considered the
    superset of data mining and its successor term.

  zh: 长话短说，在2016年，我们对数据科学的认识稍有不同。Matthew Mayo[在博客中](https://www.example.org/2016/03/data-science-puzzle-explained.html)发布了Gregory
    Piatetsky-Shapiro制作的视觉表示图。许多方面都发生了变化。其中两个突出的变化是数据科学不再位于图中心，以及定义数据科学的方法不同。数据科学现在通过与其他学科的关系来定义，如人工智能（AI）、机器学习（ML）、深度学习、大数据（BD）和数据挖掘（DM）。数据科学位于AI、ML和BD的交汇处，与DM有内在关系，因为它被认为是数据挖掘的超集及其后继术语。
- en: 'These two visuals might seem completely different, but they do share a lot
    of similarities: the disciplines that are visualized in Piatetsky-Shapiro’s picture
    all require hacking skills, mathematics and statistics knowledge and substantive
    expertise or domain knowledge.'

    background of data scientists. As a result, there have also been many different
    results. In the [O’Reilly Data Science Salary Survey of 2014](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/2014-data-science-salary-survey.pdf),
    about 28% of the respondents had a Bachelor’s degree, while 44% had a Master’s
    degree and 20% had a Ph.D. Common fields that data scientists have as backgrounds
    are mathematics/Statistics, Computer Sciences, and Engineering. The results that
    are represented in the infographic are from [2016](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/2016-data-science-salary-survey.csp).
