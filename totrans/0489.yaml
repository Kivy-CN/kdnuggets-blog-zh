    to having a successful data science career. After reading this, you’ll realize
    that there’s much more to being a good data scientist than building complex models.

- en: With that said, here are my 3 most important lessons I’ve learned in my data
    science career!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. A large portion of time is actually spent in between your projects (before
    and after).

- en: One thing that I noticed is that almost all data science courses and boot camps
    emphasize and elaborate on the modeling phase of the lifecycle of a project, while
    in reality, that only makes up a small component of the entire process.
  prefs: []

- en: If it takes you a month to build a preliminary machine learning model at work,
    you can expect to spend a month understanding the business problem beforehand
    and documenting and socializing the project afterward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s not just recommended that you complete these steps prior and subsequent
    to building your model, but **it’s pivotal for the success of your project**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let’s dive into the importance of each:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Business Understanding**: understanding the business problem at hand is critical
    for your success. For example, if you’re building a machine learning model, you
    should know what the model is supposed to predict, who’s going to use it, how
    it’s going to be used practically, what metrics you’ll use to assess the model,
    and so on. It’s essential that you take the time to understand **everything **about
    the business objective to create an applicable model.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Documentation**: While I agree that documentation is less exciting than munging
    through data and building models, it’s important that you have clear and concise
    documentation for your code, for any tables that you build, and for how the model
    was built. This is really important so that you OR someone else can easily refer
    to these resources when using your models or when fixing them.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Socialization**: Socialization rarely gets talked about, but your projects
    won’t be successful if they’re not used by the business. Socializing your projects
    entails presenting them with relevant stakeholders, explaining their value, and
    how to use them. The more stakeholders you can sell your ideas to, the more likely
    they will adopt your data products and the more successful your projects will
    be.'

    fact, I’d argue that good communication is the difference-maker between data scientists
    and **senior **data scientists.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I started learning data science, I tried learning the most complicated
    concepts without learning the basics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After years of experience, I’ve realized that the basics are sufficient enough
    to get you over 80% of the way in your career. Why? Simpler solutions always win.
    They’re easier to understand, easier to implement, and easier to maintain. Once
    a simple solution demonstrates its value to the company, only then could you look
    into more complex solutions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After 3 years of work, I am convinced that mastering SQL is pivotal to have
    a successful career. SQL is not a hard skill to learn (i.e., SELECT FROM WHERE),
    but it is certainly a hard skill to perfect. SQL is essential for data wrangling,
    data exploration, data visualization (building dashboards), building reports,
    and building data pipelines.

    is also very important.

    in an easy manner.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Inferential statistics** allow you to make conclusions based on limited amounts
    of data (samples). This is essential for building explanatory models and A/B testing.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is important mainly for performing EDA and feature engineering. That
    being said, these two steps can also be completed using SQL, so that’s something
    to keep in mind. I personally like to have Python in my tech stack because I find
    it easier to perform EDA in a Jupyter Notebook than a SQL console or a dashboard.

    an enormous amount of time on building one final model.

- en: Generally, it’s always better to spend less time on a model to get an initial
    version into production and iterate from there. Why?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Allocating less time on an initial model incentivizes you to come up with a
    simpler solution. And like I said earlier in this article, there are several benefits
    to a simpler solution.

    you can deploy your project sooner than later.

    deploy them** so that you can receive feedback, iterate, and improve **your projects.
