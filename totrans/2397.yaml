    to improve decision-making. It is called a random forest because it is a forest
    of trees that uses bagging and feature randomness. These multiple trees are combined
    together to make predictions.

- en: Normalization is a technique that is done during the data preparation phase
    for machine learning. It is the process of organizing data in a dataset by creating
    new values and presenting the data so that it has a general distribution. It is
    a type of scaling technique where values are rescaled so they range between 0
    and 1 - this is also known as Min-Max scaling. This is done to reduce or completely
    remove redundant data, and data errors.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process of scaling data through normalization is to ensure that a specific
    feature is not prioritized over another. This technique is particularly important
    in algorithms that are distance-based, such as K nearest Neighbors and K-means
    as it requires Euclidean Distance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the Random Forest algorithm is not a distance-based model - it is a
    tree-based model. Each node in a Random Forest is not comparing feature values,
    it is simply splitting a sorted list that requires absolute values for branching.
    The algorithm is based on partitioning the data to make predictions, therefore,
    it does not require normalization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, a decision tree splits a node on a feature, where this feature
    is not influenced by another feature and neither influences another feature. This
    means that all the remaining features have no effect on the split - so we can
    say that tree-based algorithms are insensitive to the scaling of features.

- en: Rather than scaling features, the Random Forest algorithm allows us to further
    understand the importance of features through Gini index. Also known as Gini impurity,
    determines how well a decision tree, random forest, or another tree-based model
    was split.

    when selected randomly. Gini impurity scales between 0-0.5, where the minimum
    value of 0 is the best value (classification is pure) and 0.5 is the worst value
    we can get.

    of uncertainty and randomness.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normalization is a good technique to use when your data consists of being scaled
    and your choice of machine learning algorithm does not have the ability to make
    assumptions on the distribution of your data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tree-based models are not based on the distance where features have an effect
    on one another. Gini index and Entropy are both used to calculate information
    gain, therefore normalization is not required.
