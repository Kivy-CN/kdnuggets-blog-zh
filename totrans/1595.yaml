    due to big data.  Data, like water, is powerful.  Massive volumes of structured
    and unstructured data, wide variety of internal and external data, and high-velocity

    in batch to monitor business performance, to the predictive enterprise that leverages
    all available data in real-time to optimize business performance.  However, organizations

    aspirations with respect to leveraging big data analytics to power their value
    creation processes?  Some organizations struggle to understand the business potential
    of big data.  They are unclear as to the different stages of business maturity. 
    Our Big Data Maturity model benchmarks an organization’s big data business aspirations,

    between business and IT stakeholders to identify the right business opportunities

    big data business opportunities can be implemented by IT.'

    a process to continuously uncover and publish new insights about the business.
     Organizations need a well-defined process to tease out and integrate analytic
    insights back into the operational systems.  The process should clearly define
    roles and responsibilities between business users, the BI/DW team, and data scientists
    to operationalize big data.'

    and how big data can power the organization’s value creation processes.'

- en: Organizations don’t fail at Big Data because of a lack of use cases; they fail
    because they have too many.  Organizations need a formal, collaborative process
    to identify, validate, vet, value and prioritize the use cases, and ensure IT
    and Business alignment in pursuing those use cases with the optimal mix of high
    business value and high implementation feasibility (think “low hanging fruit”).
     Invest the time upfront of a Big Data and Data Science initiative to understand
    in details the financial, customer and operational drivers that constitute a use
    case, and flag any potential inhibitors and implementation risks. Come into this
    game with eyes wide open (see Figure 5)!

    alignment between the business and IT stakeholders in identifying the initial
    big data business use cases that 1) deliver sufficient value to the business,
    while 2) possessing a high probability of success.  One can find multiple business
    use cases where big data and advanced analytics can deliver compelling business
    value; and it is critical to big data and data science adoption that the business
    stakeholders have had a chance to voice their opinions and to help proactively
    set the big data and data science agenda.
