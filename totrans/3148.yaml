    the cookie in your mouth. Being the intelligent, well-reasoned person you are,
    you know the fortune is insignificant—no one can predict the future. However,

    of your life or whether you should wear the blue or the red tie to work, but it
    is very good at using historical data to identify existing patterns and use them
    to predict what will happen in the future. Unlike most advanced analytics solutions,
    time series modeling is a low-cost solution that can provide powerful insights.

- en: Time series involves the use of data that are indexed by equally spaced increments
    of time (minutes, hours, days, weeks, etc.). Due to the discrete nature of time
    series data, many time series data sets have a seasonal and/or trend element built
    into the data. The first step in time series modeling is to account for existing
    seasons (a recurring pattern over a fixed period of time) and/or trends (upward
    or downward movement in the data). Accounting for these embedded patterns is what
    we call making the data stationary.  Examples of trending and seasonal data can
    be seen if figures 1 and 2 below.

    We keep throwing around the term *stationarity*, but what exactly does it mean?
  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A stationary series is one where the mean of the series is no longer a function
    of time. With trending data, as time increase the mean of the series either increases
    or decreases with time (think of the steady increase in housing prices over time).
    For seasonal data, the mean of the series fluctuates in accordance with the season
    (think of the increase and decrease in temperature every 24 hours).

    the data or linear regression. To take a difference, you calculate the difference
    between consecutive observations. To use linear regression, you include binary
    indicator variables for your seasonal component in the model. Before we decide
    which of these methods to apply, let’s explore our data. We plotted the historical
    daily page views using SAS Visual Analytics.

    season. The prolonged increase in the number of page views over time indicates
    that there is a slightly upward trend. With a general idea of the data we then
    applied a statistical test of stationarity, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
    test. The ADF test is a unit-root test of stationarity. We won’t get into the
    details here, but a unit-root indicates if the series is nonstationary so we use
    this test to determine the appropriate method to handle the trend or season (differencing
    or regression). Based on the ADF test for the data above we removed the seven-day
    season by regressing on dummy variables for day of the week and removed the trend
    by differencing the data. The resulting stationary data can be seen in the figure
    below.

    to establish a base level forecast. We should also note that most base level forecasts
    do not require the first step of making your data stationary. This is only required

    interested in forecasting) are equal to the most current value of y. This is considered
    the most basic, or “naïve model”, where the most recent observation is the most
    likely outcome for tomorrow.

    in the data set are given equal weight. Future forecasts of y are calculated as
    the average of the observed data. The forecast generated could be quite accurate
    if the data is level, but would provide a very poor forecast if the data is trending
    or has a seasonal component. The forecasted values for the page views data using
    the average model can be seen below.

    a base level model is to implement an exponential smoothing model (ESM). ESMs
    strike a happy medium between the naïve and average models mentioned above, where
    the most recent observation is given the greatest weight and the weight of all
    previous observations decrease exponentially into the past. ESMs also allow for
    a seasonal and/or trending component to be incorporated into the model. The following
    table provides an example of an initial weight of 0.7 decreasing exponentially
    at a rate of 0.3.

    还允许将季节性和/或趋势成分纳入模型。下表提供了一个初始权重为 0.7，按 0.3 的速率呈指数递减的示例。

- en: After identifying the model that best accounts for the trend and season in the
    data, you ultimately have enough information to generate a decent forecast, as
    we see in Figure 2 above. However, these models are still limited in that they
    do not account for the correlation that the variable of interest has with itself
    over previous periods of time. We refer to this correlation as autocorrelation,
    which is commonly found in time series data. If the data has autocorrelation,
    as ours does, then there may be additional modeling that can be done to further
    improve upon the baseline forecast.
  id: totrans-55

- en: To capture the effects of autocorrelation in a time series model, it is necessary
    to implement an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (or ARIMA) model. ARIMA
    models include parameters to account for season and trend (like using dummy variables
    for days of the week and differencing), but also allow for the inclusion of autoregressive
    and/or moving average terms to deal with the autocorrelation imbedded in the data.
    By using the appropriate ARIMA model, we can further increase the accuracy of
    the page views forecast as seen in Figure 3 below.

    identifying which model has the best accuracy is not always reliable. Calculating
    the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percent Error) is a quick and easy way to compare the
    overall forecast accuracy of a proposed model – the lower the MAPE the better
    the forecast accuracy. Comparing the MAPE of each of the models previously discussed,
    it is easy to see that the seasonal ARIMA model provides the best forecast accuracy.
    Note that there are several other types of comparison statistics that can be used
    for model comparison.

    to remove as much of the noise (trend, season, and autocorrelation) as possible
    so that the only remaining movement unaccounted for in the data is pure randomness.
    For our data we found that a seasonal ARIMA model with regression variables for
    day of the week provided the most accurate forecast. The ARIMA model forecast
    was more accurate when compared to the naïve, average, and ESM models mentioned
    above.
