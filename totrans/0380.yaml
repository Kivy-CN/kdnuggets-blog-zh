    a data scientist. I am passionate about helping other professionals, especially
    those with non-technical backgrounds, switch careers to data science or other
    data analytics professions.

- en: After hundreds of applications and rejection emails, I finally landed an interview
    with my current boss, Eric. During the interview, he asked me if I knew anything
    about BERT, a robust natural language processing algorithm developed by Google.
    Unfortunately, I had to tell him “No.”

- en: I was disappointed but excited. This interview was the turning point in my job
    search. The field of data science is broad, and I was applying to various roles
    with little focus. But after my interview with Eric, I decided to focus on sequence
    models and natural language processing. I needed to learn about BERT.

- en: Over the next two weeks, I completed the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course [*Learn
    BERT-most powerful NLP algorithm by Google*](https://www.udemy.com/course/bert-nlp-algorithm/),
    and two guided projects from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): [*Fine Tune
    BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow*](https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow) and [*Sentiment
    Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT*](https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow).
    I was so excited about what I had learned that I sent Eric an email to tell him
    how much he had motivated me. I told him about the projects I completed, and he
    was impressed. As a result, he scheduled a second interview with another team
    member.
