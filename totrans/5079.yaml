- en: In September on [/r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/),
    we find a neural network tutorial video for C++, read that deep learning based
    Chinese character handwriting recognition beats humans, grab ourselves a machine
    learning algorithm cheat sheet, connect the dots between functional programming
    and deep learning, and discover a neural network paper repository.

- en: This post is a video of [Dave Miller](http://www.millermattson.com/dave/) explaining
    a simple back propagation neural network, and demonstrating how to code one in
    C++. The [video](https://vimeo.com/19569529) is approximately one hour in length,
    and from my own experience following the tutorial myself, I can tell you that
    accomplishing the stated goal of having a hand-crafted, functioning neural network
    during video runtime is attainable. The short comment section also contains some
    useful discussion, including a reference to [this online deep learning book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
    You can find Miller's own resulting neural network code [here](http://inkdrop.net/dave/docs/neural-net-tutorial.cpp).

    handwritten Chinese characters is 96.1%, which Fujitsu has surpassed with an accuracy
    rate of 96.7%. In the spirit of much recent machine learning research, deep neural
    networks were the tool of choice for the researchers. This isn't [your father's
    handwritten digit recongition task](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer),
    though, given that there are 3800 Chinese characters to recognize. An innovative
    method was also derived by the researchers to automatically deform handwritten
    samples, in order to increase the number of training samples.

    of machine learning algorithm implementations (via libraries) implemented in both
    Python and R, side-by-side. The corresponding code covers the entire modeling
    process (data loading, training, testing) for 10 popular algorithms, including
    Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Linear Regression. [The cheat sheet](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/09/full-cheatsheet-machine-learning-algorithms/)
    is equally useful for newbies to one language or the other (or both) and experienced
    implementers looking to brush up or for a quick copy and paste solution.

    and this month his topic of choice is Deep Learning: its youth, its projected
    and altered form in the not-so-distant future, and its connection to functional
    programming. Central to this, Olah puts forth the speculative theory that "deep
    learning studies a connection between optimization and functional programming,"
    equates representations to types, and goes on to compare various different neural
    networks to their perceived functional equivalents. While Olah himself states
    that "this is a pretty strange article and I feel a bit weird posting it," the
    article is a great read and helps us look at 2 familiar, unrelated concepts in
    a new light. Here is a [direct link to the paper.](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/)'

    and NN enthusiast [Robert S. Dionne](https://twitter.com/robertsdionne) has done
    everyone a favor and compiled, organized, and shared a [list of papers](https://github.com/robertsdionne/neural-network-papers)
    relevant to our current collective obsession. It's neatly presented in 30 categories
    such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Parallel
    Training. There are a lot of deep learning papers emerging, and it's nice to have
    people willing to both organize and [explain](/2015/10/top-arxiv-deep-learning-papers-explained.html)
    them.
