    and with the advent of quantitative analysis, many from academics to quants have
    used statistical methods to better understand the relationship between news and
    market data, such as stock prices or trade volumes.

    relationships between news data and the market, as a foundation for deeper and
    more targeted analyses. Our goal is to provide a set of tools to the reader that
    will assist them in exploring and cross referencing financial and news data. Our
    goal is NOT to predict the stock market, or discover specific correlations or
    causal relationships.

    [Aylien’s News API](https://aylien.com/product/news-api) which allows users to
    filter the world’s news data, both real-time and historical, using a comprehensive
    set of filters. We use these filters to create news feeds that correspond to our
    securities of interest (e.g. stocks, ETFs, cryptos, etc). We then use Yahoo! Finance
    to retrieve the market data (price and volume) for these securities. Putting the
    two together, we can construct a joint dataset consisting of both market and news-related
    data for any given security, in a timeframe of choice.

    article, it is worth mentioning that many of the techniques we explore in this
    post are extendable to other types of financial or economical data, for instance
    in order to study the relationship between layoffs and the news, we could retrieve
    historical layoff data from statistics offices, and align them with the news using
    the [News API](https://aylien.com/product/news-api)’s events filters (e.g. to
    retrieve news articles that are explicitly about layoffs and workforce-related
    announcements).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anomalies are an important aspect of any time series data, that for a relatively
    steady activity such as the number of news articles written about a large company
    like Apple, reflect fundamental shifts in the underlying inputs, which in turn
    potentially reflect important real-world changes such as earnings announcements
    or new product releases.

    in our time series data by detecting points that are outside the interquartile
    range after correcting the time series data for trend and seasonality. The output

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When looking at movements in the stock price or trade volume, it’s important
    to understand whether those movements happened independently or in correlation
    with the market. Intuitively, perhaps we could expect to see a more prominent
    correlation between news and market activity when a security moves independently
    from the market, or at moments where the movement is less dependent on the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In order to study this hypothesis, we can leverage two well known financial
    indicators: Beta and R-squared.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beta is a derived statistic that measures the variance or volatility of a stock
    against the overall market or a benchmark stock/index. In theory, high-beta stocks
    deliver outsized performance when the market goes up, and outsized underperformance
    when the market goes down. To calculate beta for a stock, we can plot its change
    vs. changes in a benchmark stock/index (e.g the S&P 500) and find the linear regression
    line that best fits the data. The slope of that line represents beta.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: R-squared measures the degree to which a security’s performance can be attributed
    to the performance of the selected benchmark index. In other words, R-squared
    aims to determine how much of the movement in an asset can be explained by the
    movements in the market.
