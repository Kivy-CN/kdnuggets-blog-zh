    making it a suitable engine to orchestrate and execute a pipeline authored with
    Kedro. To keep the workflow seamless, we are pleased to unveil the latest version
    of the [Kedro-Airflow plugin](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-airflow),
    which simplifies deployment of a Kedro project on Airflow.

    pipelines and looking for a good way to deploy those pipelines to Airflow. Kedro
    does an outstanding job of allowing data scientists to apply good software engineering
    principles to their code and make it modular, but Kedro pipelines need a separate
    scheduling and execution environment to run at scale. Given this need, there was
    a natural bond between Kedro pipeline and Airflow: we wanted to do everything
    we could to build a great developer experience at the intersection of the two
    tools.'

    specific abstraction layers to assist with DAG authoring and deployment, leading
    to a richer plugin ecosystem. There will be extra opportunity to integrate the `kedro-airflow` package
    with the Airflow API for a great developer experience.

- en: As we look towards Airflow 3.0 and beyond, building upon developer love and
    trust is inevitable. But it won’t stop there. As data orchestration becomes critical
    to a growing number of business units, we want Airflow to become a medium for
    making data engineering more approachable. We seek to democratise access such
    that product owners and data scientists alike can leverage Airflow’s distributed
    execution and scheduling power without being a master in Python or Kubernetes.
    Empowering users to author and deploy data pipelines from a framework of their
    choice will become increasingly important in that journey.

  zh: 工作流编排技术的未来是什么？
- en: Airflow’s inception kicked off a “data pipelines as code” movement that changed
    the way enterprises thought about workflow orchestration. For many years, job
    scheduling was handled by a combination of legacy drag-and-drop frameworks and
    complex networks of cron jobs. As we transitioned into the “big data” era and
    companies began building dedicated teams to operationalise their siloed data,
    the need for additional flexibility, control, and governance became apparent.

  zh: Airflow的诞生启动了一个“数据管道即代码”的运动，这改变了企业对工作流编排的思考方式。多年里，作业调度由传统的拖放框架和复杂的cron作业网络组合处理。随着我们过渡到“大数据”时代，公司开始建立专门的团队来操作其孤立的数据，额外的灵活性、控制和治理的需求变得显而易见。
- en: When Maxime Beauchemin and the folks at Airbnb [built and open sourced Airflow](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airflow-a-workflow-management-platform-46318b977fd8) with
    flexible, codified data pipelines as a first-class feature, they propelled code-driven
    orchestration into the spotlight. Airflow solved many first-order problems for
    data engineers, which explains its explosive adoption. But with that early adoption
    came some pitfalls; since Airflow is highly configurable by design, users began
    applying it to use cases it was not necessarily designed for. This imposed evolutionary
    stress on the project, pushing the community to add additional configuration options
    to “mould” Airflow to various use cases.

  zh: 当**Maxime Beauchemin**和Airbnb团队[构建并开源了Airflow](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airflow-a-workflow-management-platform-46318b977fd8)，将灵活且编码化的数据管道作为一项首要功能时，他们将代码驱动的编排推向了聚光灯下。Airflow解决了许多数据工程师面临的首要问题，这解释了它的爆炸式采用。但随着早期的采用，也出现了一些陷阱；由于Airflow设计上高度可配置，用户开始将其应用于不一定为之设计的用例。这对项目施加了进化压力，推动社区增加额外的配置选项，以“塑造”Airflow以适应各种用例。
- en: While the added configuration options helped Airflow extend to accommodate these
    additional use cases, they introduced a new class of user needs. Data platform
    owners and administrators now need a way to deliver standard patterns to their
    pipeline authors to abate business risk. Likewise, pipeline authors need additional
    guardrails to be sure they don’t “use Airflow wrong”. Finally, engineers with
    a pythonic background now need to learn how to operationalise big data infrastructure
    for stable & reliable orchestration at scale.

  zh: 尽管增加的配置选项帮助Airflow扩展以适应这些额外的用例，但它们也引入了一类新的用户需求。数据平台拥有者和管理员现在需要一种方法来向他们的管道作者提供标准模式，以减少业务风险。同样，管道作者需要额外的保护措施，以确保他们不会“错误地使用Airflow”。最后，具有Python背景的工程师现在需要学习如何为大规模稳定可靠的编排操作大数据基础设施。
- en: We see the future of workflow orchestration technology accommodating some of
    these categorical changes in the needs of the user. If the journey thus far has
    been one of “[The Rise of the Data Engineer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-rise-of-the-data-engineer-91be18f1e603/)”,
    we see the future as “The Democratisation of Data Engineering”. All users — from
    the data scientists to the data platform owner — will have access to powerful,
    distributed, flexible data pipeline orchestration. They’ll benefit as it integrates
    from the authoring tools that they know and love, but has guardrails to accommodate
    specific usage patterns that prevent folks from straying off of the happy path.
