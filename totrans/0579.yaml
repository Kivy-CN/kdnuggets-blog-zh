  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists are highly educated — 88% have at least a Master’s degree and
    46% have PhDs — and while there are notable exceptions, a very strong educational
    background is usually required to develop the depth of knowledge necessary to
    be a data scientist. To become a data scientist, you could earn a Bachelor’s degree
    in Computer science, Social sciences, Physical sciences, and Statistics. The most
    common fields of study are Mathematics and Statistics (32%), followed by Computer
    Science (19%) and Engineering (16%). A degree in any of these courses will give
    you the skills you need to process and analyze big data.
  prefs: []

- en: After your degree programme, you are not done yet. The truth is, most data scientists
    have a Master’s degree or Ph.D and they also undertake online training to learn
    a special skill like how to use Hadoop or Big Data querying. Therefore, you can
    enroll for a master’s degree program in the field of Data science, Mathematics,
    Astrophysics or any other related field. The skills you have learned during your
    degree programme will enable you to easily transition to data science.

    R is generally preferred. R is specifically designed for data science needs. You
    can use R to solve any problem you encounter in data science. In fact, 43 percent
    of data scientists are using R to solve statistical problems. However, R has a
    steep learning curve.

    Having experience with Hive or Pig is also a strong selling point. Familiarity
    with cloud tools such as Amazon S3 can also be beneficial. A study carried out
    by CrowdFlower on 3490 LinkedIn data science jobs ranked Apache Hadoop as the
    second most important skill for a data scientist with 49% rating.

    you have exceeds the memory of your system or you need to send data to different
    servers, this is where Hadoop comes in. You can use Hadoop to quickly convey data
    to various points on a system. That’s not all. You can use Hadoop for data exploration,
    data filtration, data sampling and summarization.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though NoSQL and Hadoop have become a large component of data science,
    it is still expected that a candidate will be able to write and execute complex
    queries in SQL. SQL (structured query language) is a programming language that
    can help you to carry out operations like add, delete and extract data from a
    database. It can also help you to carry out analytical functions and transform
    database structures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to be proficient in SQL as a data scientist. This is because SQL is
    specifically designed to help you access, communicate and work on data. It gives
    you insights when you use it to query a database. It has concise commands that
    can help you to save time and lessen the amount of programming you need to perform
    difficult queries. Learning SQL will help you to better understand relational
    databases and boost your profile as a data scientist.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apache Spark is becoming the most popular big data technology worldwide. It
    is a big data computation framework just like Hadoop. The only difference is that
    Spark is faster than Hadoop. This is because Hadoop reads and writes to disk,
    which makes it slower, but Spark caches its computations in memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apache Spark is specifically designed for data science to help run its complicated
    algorithm faster. It helps in disseminating data processing when you are dealing
    with a big sea of data thereby, saving time. It also helps data scientist to handle
    complex unstructured data sets. You can use it on one machine or cluster of machines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apache spark makes it possible for data scientists to prevent loss of data in
    data science. The strength of Apache Spark lies in its speed and platform which
    makes it easy to carry out data science projects. With Apache spark, you can carry
    out analytics from data intake to distributing computing.

    and techniques. This includes neural networks, reinforcement learning, adversarial
    learning, etc. If you want to stand out from other data scientists, you need to
    know Machine learning techniques such as supervised machine learning, decision
    trees, logistic regression etc. These skills will help you to solve different
    data science problems that are based on predictions of major organizational outcomes.

    to be translated into a format that will be easy to comprehend. People naturally
    understand pictures in forms of charts and graphs more than raw data. An idiom
    says “A picture is worth a thousand words”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a data scientist, you must be able to visualize data with the aid of data
    visualization tools such as ggplot, d3.js and Matplotlib, and Tableau. These tools
    will help you to convert complex results from your projects to a format that will
    be easy to comprehend. The thing is, a lot of people do not understand serial
    correlation or p values. You need to show them visually what those terms represent
    in your results.

    Unstructured data are undefined content that does not fit into database tables.
    Examples include videos, blog posts, customer reviews, social media posts, video
    feeds, audio etc. They are heavy texts lumped together. Sorting these type of
    data is difficult because they are not streamlined.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    complexity. Working with unstructured data helps you to unravel insights that
    can be useful for decision making. As a data scientist, you must have the ability
    to understand and manipulate unstructured data from different platforms.

    scientist, you need to be able to ask questions about data because data scientists
    spend about 80 percent of their time discovering and preparing data. This is because
    data science field is a field that is evolving very fast and you have to learn
    more to keep up with the pace.

    relevant books on trends in data science. Don’t be overwhelmed by the sheer amount
    of data that is flying around the internet, you have to be able to know how to
    make sense of it all. Curiosity is one of the skills you need to succeed as a
    data scientist. For example, initially, you may not see much insight in the data
    you have collected. Curiosity will enable you to sift through the data to find
    answers and more insights.

    working in, and know what business problems your company is trying to solve. In
    terms of data science, being able to discern which problems are important to solve
    for the business is critical, in addition to identifying new ways the business

    can clearly and fluently translate their technical findings to a non-technical
    team, such as the Marketing or Sales departments. A data scientist must enable
    the business to make decisions by arming them with quantified insights, in addition
    to understanding the needs of their non-technical colleagues in order to wrangle
    the data appropriately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to communicate by using data storytelling. As a data scientist, you have to know
    how to create a storyline around the data to make it easy for anyone to understand.
    For instance, presenting a table of data is not as effective as sharing the insights
    from those data in a storytelling format. Using storytelling will help you to
    properly communicate your findings to your employers.
