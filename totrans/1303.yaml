    Start Over.](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-id-learn-data-science-if-i-could-start-over-2-years-in-b821d8a4876c)”
    In this article, I segmented what to learn by subject, i.e., statistics & mathematics,
    programming fundamentals, and machine learning.

    call it. But trust me when I say this, the better your fundamentals are, the smoother
    your data science journey will be.

    topics: statistics & probability, mathematics, and programming.'

    probably heard this for the MILLIONth time, but a data scientist is really just
    a modern statistician.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Academy’s course on statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability).
  prefs:

    that you go through Georgia Tech’s course called “[Statistical Methods](https://mediaspace.gatech.edu/playlist/dedicated/74258101/1_g5xwvbde/1_iw8fk73m).”
    It is a little more difficult as it goes through more proofs, but it will help
    you understand the intricacies of each idea.

    determine how much time you need to spend learning basic mathematics. There are
    three areas that you should learn: **calculus, integrals, and linear algebra:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Calculus is essential when it comes to anything related to optimization (which
    is quite relevant in data science). I recommend [Khan Academy’s course on calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1)
    for this.
  prefs:

    testing. I recommend [Khan Academy’s course on integrals](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but even then, it’s good to know for other fundamental machine learning concepts,
    like principal component analysis and recommendation systems. Surprise surprise,
    you can guess what course I recommend for this. The link is provided [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra).

    knowing the core fundamentals in programming will make your life much easier,

  prefs:

    is marketing themselves — you’ll eventually want to show what you’ve learned.

    creating a section called “Personal Projects,” where you can list two to three
    projects that you’ve completed.

    while we’re on the topic of Github, it would be a good idea to learn Git. *Here,
    you can include all of your data science projects, and more importantly, you can
    share your code with others to see.

    in the form of a website as well. HTML and CSS are very simple to learn, and it
    would be a fun project! If you don’t have the time, something like Squarespace
    will work well too.
