- en: MLOps is a relatively new term to the data industry. In the past, companies
    solely focused on hiring data scientists and machine learning practitioners. These
    individuals could build predictive models that helped companies automate workflows
    and make key decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, however, machine learning projects started to cause organizations
    more harm than good. They failed when put into production, leading to missed business
    opportunities and unhappy clients.

- en: Why did this happen?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On paper, these companies did everything right. They hired a team of experienced
    data scientists who possessed the ability to build technically sound models. They
    also had domain experts who outlined the business use-case clearly, and were able
    to successfully translate a problem statement into a machine learning project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The models built as a result of these initiatives performed impeccably in a
    test environment, but failed when rendered to an end-user. This was an outcome
    that nobody could have predicted, and ended up costing organizations millions
    of dollars.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Here’s the problem:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The focus of data scientists lies solely in model building. Once these machine
    learning models reach the hands of an end-user, there is no proper system in place
    to ensure that they are performing well in the real-world. Models can act very
    differently when placed in an environment that they weren’t trained in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since machine learning was so new to most organizations, these factors weren’t
    taken into consideration in the past, which led to disastrous consequences and
    poor performance.

    The software works out when and where a crime will take place, and sends officers
    to the area to make arrests. The algorithm would then re-train on this data to
    make future crime predictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ironically, the process above ended up creating a feedback loop. Every time
    an arrest was made, the model was updated and sent more law enforcement officers
    to the same area. This in turn, led to a higher number of arrests in specific
    places, which was again fed to the model. The Predpol system ended up predicting
    higher crime rates in areas that had more police officers rather than regions
    with a larger number of criminals.

    leaked into training data, which was then used to further enhance the algorithm.

    learning model that performs well one day can be highly inaccurate the next.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example of this can be seen in a [company that works to build machine learning
    models for healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/04/03/why-machine-learning-models-crash-and-burn-in-production/?sh=594ca5ab2f43).
    This organization deployed an algorithm to predict 30-day hospital readmissions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After around 2–3 months, an initially effective model started making highly
    inaccurate predictions. Every hospital the model was deployed to faced the same
    issue, and the algorithm’s poor performance made clients unhappy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A team was assigned to look into this, and they realized that model performance
    faltered every time there was a change in the training database. For example,
    if the hospital made changes in the insurance they accepted, this had a direct
    impact on the type of patients who went to the ER, which in turn negatively affected
    the model’s accuracy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After realizing the issue at hand, they immediately worked to remediate the
    situation. An entire team of technical and business savvy individuals were assigned
    to monitor changes in incoming data and ensure that these changes were reflected
    in the predictive algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This phenomenon of change in input data is called **data drift**, and is one
    of the most common causes of model degradation in companies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you worked at an organization with a primary audience demographic
    of 18–34 year old women and trained your model on their behavioural attributes,
    you introduce a bias into the algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the company launches a new product line catered towards an older group of
    individuals, the model will no longer be relevant. It needs to be re-trained on
    data that accurately represents the company’s current user behaviour.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    fast as possible to ensure that companies face minimal loss.

    changes at specific intervals of time. Machine learning models need to be updated
    regularly with seasonal changes in mind.

    the last 3 months, your algorithm is going to make predictions based on beverages

    to try and entice customers with an unfavourable choice of beverages, which will
    incur a loss to the company.

    of DevOps. DevOps is a role that integrates the job scope of software developers
    and operations teams to automate workflows. An MLOps engineer’s role is very similar
    to the profession of a DevOps engineer, except that the former works with machine
    learning models.

    pipelines. CI and CD stand for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment,
    and enable code changes made by the data scientist to be delivered quickly and
    reliably into production.
