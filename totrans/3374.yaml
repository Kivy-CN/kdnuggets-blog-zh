- en: In this post, we discuss how we could implement Continuous improvement and Continuous
    learning in IoT systems. Continuous improvement is a well-known concept (ex from
    Kaizen or Six Sigma). For IoT, we propose that to implement continuous improvement,
    we have to implement continuous learning.  Specifically, this means we train a
    model in one environment and deploy it to multiple points in the IoT ecosystem
    (Device level, work flow level and system level).  Models could be built and deployed
    across devices to capture learning at various points. This learning is then consolidated
    through a central model. The new data is continuously monitored and when data
    patterns change,the model is re-calibrated to accommodate the latest knowledge.
    Thus, this model ties to Enterprise AI. We discuss these ideas in the forthcoming
    [Implementing Enterprise AI course starting in January 2017](/2016/11/futuretext-implementing-enterprise-ai-course.html)

    geo-tagged. This means, there are two forms of analytics for IoT: **Time series
    and Spatial analytics.** Time series analytics typically lead to insights like
    Anomaly detection. Thus, classifiers (used to detect anomalies) are commonly used
    for IoT analytics to detect abnormal patterns.  In addition, by looking at historical
    trends, streaming, combining data from multiple events (**sensor fusion**), we
    can get new insights.'

    is to analyze the data as close to the event as possible because we need Real
    Time interaction. Hence, for IoT analytics, we often need to perform Edge Processing
    – a topic I have discussed in [IoT Edge analytics](/2016/09/evolution-iot-edge-analytics.html).

    processing**, we are trying to find out what happened now (as opposed to what
    happened in the past).  Sensor data could be combined to infer an event (**Complex
    event processing).** Finally, you could apply these models at the **Data Lake.**

    Continuous improvement is not a new concept. It is an integral part of [Kaizen
    and Six Sigma](kaizen%20https:/www.isixsigma.com/methodology/kaizen/kaizen-six-sigma-ensures-continuous-improvement/)

    An analytic can be typically developed at the system level. Once developed, it
    can be deployed to a device (**Operational level**) or chained with other analytics
    to create a **workflow** (probably spanning multiple devices).  Analytics can
    be **orchestrated at multiple levels**.

    a single working relationship with analytics at the centre. It also fits in with
