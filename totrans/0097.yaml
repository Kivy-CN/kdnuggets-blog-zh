- en: It’s February 7th. Quite cold outside but apparently not enough to cool down
    the excitement ChatGPT sparked just before winter. Microsoft is ready to announce
    Bing Chat, a chatbot built on top of the next-generation model from OpenAI and
    capable of web search — Google is doomed (for the second time in a matter of three
    months, no less). Everyone will jump to Bing and Microsoft will eat Google’s search
    revenue.

    been particularly awaiting a rare one with 8 (or is it 16?) petals. It is about
    to open up (or maybe not). GPT-4 is out; the most secretive release ever for a
    language model. But it’s better, no — much better than GPT-3.5\. Who wouldn’t
    pay $20/month for a 100x productivity boost? It’s a bargain.

    off-key — a rushed release? It may appear the pincer movement of the two above
    worked just fine. But Bard is just a tester — the real banger will come down the
    road with more powerful models. Google is back in the race.

    social media platform saturation inspired by the craze to sign up on Threads (only
    to [sign out a week later](https://fortune.com/2023/07/18/threads-loses-half-active-users-mark-zuckerberg/)).
    It was timely and fantastically relatable. I loved the intro style — which I borrowed
    for this article. The headline structure is borrowed too, from [another article](https://medium.com/swlh/if-you-want-to-be-a-creator-delete-all-but-two-social-media-platforms-c1ac70b2d98e).

    with social media is happening with generative AI tools. Perhaps this is what
    we have become as a society, driven by the fear of missing out, the sheer amount
    of overwhelming information, the never-ending drive to accelerate our careers,
    or the desperation not to be left behind.'

    trade off our mental sanity for the absorbing trap of overabundance. I don’t need
    so much of it. You don’t either. We actually need almost none of it.

    one tool for writing and another for images. But maybe you want a different one
    for programming. Or maybe you don’t code. Or maybe you don’t care about AI art
    instead. But you get the idea.) Yet it reflects a very real sensation that I —
    and I dare to guess you, too — have since ChatGPT went, all at once, inexplicably,
    unexpectedly, unprecedentedly, and — yes, thankfully — viral.

    merely a by-product of OpenAI iterating in public and will be certainly resolved
    soon, whatever the cause.

    “Your skills and interests make you a bad fit for 99% of platforms and a great
    fit for 1%.” She meant that for social media but it can be perfectly extrapolated
    to generative AI tools. My three criteria are ability (what am I good at?), preference

    an author or creative writer maybe high-temperature low-RLHFed base models are
    the best for you (e.g., GPT-3 or 3.5). If you’re a SEO content marketer or copywriter
    maybe tailored wrappers are the best choice (e.g., Jasper, although now ChatGPT,
    Bard, and Claude would do just fine). If you’re a tech-savvy writer maybe Llama
    2 is better to avoid dependency. If you’re a digital artist, Midjourney. If you
    have coding skills and want higher steerability, Stable Diffusion instead. As
    a coder, GPT-4 or GitHub Copilot. Data analysis? Code interpreter.'

    and more and more value but to get a portion of the succulent generative AI pie.
    Which isn’t bad. I mean, who wouldn’t do the same? It’s expected — in no way worse
    than social media platforms — but worth bearing in mind just in case you thought
    we are the main beneficiaries of this — we are not. Companies won’t hesitate a
    single second to take a direction that doesn’t benefit us. They won’t hesitate
    to cut off access to products and shut down entirely their services if they must.
