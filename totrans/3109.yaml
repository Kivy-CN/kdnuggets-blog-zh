- en: As part of an organization where I often have to explain basics of “classical”
    machine learning, I usually introduce CRISP-DM methodology (see [https://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/10/crisp-dm-top-methodology-analytics-data-mining-data-science-projects.html](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/10/crisp-dm-top-methodology-analytics-data-mining-data-science-projects.html)).

    provide a strong framework to practitioners but, in order to support more specific
    explanation of how it apply to “classic” Machine Learning and Deep Learning I
    needed to complement CRISP-DM with more specific design flow:'

    some (lot of…) are not incorporated to the flows, but I think it would help those
    who intend to introduce Machine Learning and Deep Learning to not specialists.
