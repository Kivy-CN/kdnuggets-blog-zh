    conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O and then move on to functions, introducing
    key concepts such as recursion, modular programming, and code reuse. You will
    also be presented with object-oriented programming.

    on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part
    I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Your understanding
    of algorithms has to be transparent. As you develop your career in the computer
    science world, you will refer to algorithms frequently - therefore your knowledge
    of them is imperative.
