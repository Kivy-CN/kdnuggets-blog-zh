    and there are a plethora of skills that are relevant to data scientists.

    The following skills are pivotal for **any** data scientist: SQL, Python, Statistics,
    Machine Learning. I also recommend that you learn these skills in that order.
    It may sound like a lot, but it’s no different than when you had to complete 4–6
    courses per semester in college!'

    data scientist. SQL is used to manipulate data, analyze data, build dashboards,
    build pipelines, write queries to feed into models, and the list goes on.

    By learning statistics first, you’ll have a much easier time when it comes to
    learning machine learning concepts and algorithms! Even though it may seem like
    you’re not getting anything tangible out of the first few weeks, it will be worth
    it in the later weeks.

    of a data scientist’s time, but it doesn’t take away from its importance.

    as a Data Scientist. However, finding jobs similar to data scientist positions
    will significantly increase your chances of becoming a data scientist. The reason
