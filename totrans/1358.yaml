- en: Data science is an attractive field. It’s lucrative, you get opportunities to
    work on interesting projects, and you’re always learning new things. Hence, breaking
    into the world of data science is extremely competitive. One of the best ways
    to start your data science career is through a data science internship.

    the components of a typical interview process, and some example interview questions.
    Note that the term ‘general’ is emphasized because the specifics differ company
    by company.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest difference between a data science internship interview and a full-time
    data scientist is that you typically won’t be expected to know extremely specific
    details regarding machine learning or deep learning concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you will be expected to have the fundamental building blocks to be
    able to build on them — this includes Python, R, or SQL, statistics and probability
    basics, and basic machine learning concepts.

    or R. If you’re a Python programmer, you should also have a basic understanding
    of popular libraries like **Scikit-learn **and **Pandas.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**What you should know:** You should know how to write basic functions and
    have a fundamental understanding of various data structures and their uses. You
    should also know about Scikit-learn’s basic (yet essential) capacities, like test_train_split,
    and StandardScaler. For Pandas, you should be comfortable manipulating DataFrames
    similar to how you would write a query using SQL.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you may be required to build a simple machine learning model to
    predict the quantity sold for a product. In this case, if you’re a Python user,
    it would be extremely useful to understand the Scikit-Learn library, as it provides
    a number of prebuilt functions already, like the ones mentioned above.

    (if not all) companies have in their interview process, which I’ll explain below.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Initial Screening**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, there’s an initial screening (usually a phone screen) conducted by
    a recruiter or the hiring manager of the company. The purpose of this is so that
    the interviewee gets a better understanding of the role, and the interviewer can
    get a better understanding of the interviewee.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should expect them to ask about your interest in the role and company, why
    you think you’d be a good fit, and questions related to your past experiences.
    In the rare case, you may also be asked one or two simple technical questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interviewer is simply making sure that you’re genuinely interested in the
    company, that you’re a good communicator, and that you raise no red flags.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Take-home case**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For many data science internships now, companies will require you to complete
    a take-home challenge. What this means is that they’ll give you a certain time
    period to complete a case study that they give you, which is typically reflective
    of the kind of problems you’d encounter in the actual role.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is done to see how you would approach a problem (i.e., your thought process)
    and whether you have the basic knowledge that’s required to complete the problem.
    Examples of cases include **cleaning a dataset** and **building a machine learning
    model** to make a given prediction, or **querying a dataset** and **analyzing
    the data**, or a combination of the two.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly is the on-site interview, which can consist of one to as many as six
    rounds of interviews. These interviews are composed of a **mixture of behavioral
    and technical **interview questions. You may also be required to complete a case
    on the spot for one of the rounds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While they are trying to make sure that you have a strong understanding of the
    fundamental knowledge that’s required to be successful in the role, they’re also
    assessing your behavior, your motives, and ultimately whether you’d be a good
    fit for the team or not. Make sure you’re on your best behavior but don’t forget
    to be yourself!
