- en: A **few** days back, a friend of mine came laughing at me, saying “**what is
    taking you so long to learn machine learning? It’s just a few models, I learned
    them in a week**”. Those were his exact words. I simply smiled at him and inquired
    what he had learned. He told the names of a few [machine learning algorithms](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/08/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers.html).
    I asked him what exactly he learned, then came the obvious reply of using Sklearn’s
    fit and predict methods and a brief overview of how that algorithm works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With an evil smile on my face, I asked him what he would do to get the best
    parameters? How does the model learn the best weights? What do we do when we have
    a low latency requirement? Though these are not some complex questions, He was
    sitting there silently watching my face, I had the last laugh.
  prefs: []

    fit and predict methods.

    only to realize our mistake pretty quickly. To all the people who are self-learning,
    just **remember that there are hundreds of thousands of people like you and me
    learning Machine Learning/Data Science**. Remember that we will be competing with
    people who have a Masters/Ph.D. in fields related to Data Science. So to be competitive
    with them, we need to be **really strong** with our fundamentals.

    day, there are more courses out there than the actual jobs at the moment. With
    this humongous resources there comes the dilemma to pick the right course.

- en: To be honest, most of these courses are Mediocre and don’t cover in-depth. well,
    there are few good courses out there but each of them is offering a different
    curriculum. Few covers the math part in-depth few are good at the coding part
    and so on. So today I won’t be mentioning any course in particular. I am going
    to share the approach which I followed and suggested to the same friend in the
    story. I believe it should help you with your data science journey too.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Initially, I used to learn an algorithm and used to forget after some time and
    whenever I get back to revise it I used to find it hard to understand which I
    already learned back then. Over time I realized that we humans can’t really remember
    things if they are too theoretical and we are more likely to remember it for a
    long time if learn it through visualizations. That is where geometry helps us
    visualize the core of an algorithm in the easiest way possible. And we are more
    tend to understand it deeper if we have some cool real-world daily life examples
    for these algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you complete learning an algorithm from any course of your choice, open
    a new tab and start searching for the intuition of that algorithm. Trust me, there
    are a lot of cool explanations available on the internet. For starters, Quora
    and Medium are the best places to begin with.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    algorithm actually works. One more thing you need to check is how the algorithm
    works with various forms of data like Text/categorical/numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to work, you can refer to the readily available algorithms from Scikit-Learn.
    Check the parameters of the algorithm and try to play with them and see how they
    impact the model’s performance.

    focus more on what and how it works. Why it works or Why it doesn’t work is very

    Tomorrow you make a personal project after learning algorithms and you used a
    particular X algorithm to solve it, the interviewer is most likely to respond
    with **why X algorithm why not Y?** Let's think you came up with accuracy as the
    reason, then comes the toughest question **why do you think it works better than

- en: 4\. Why the interpretability of an Algorithm is important
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the key steps, the reason this is important is that as a job
    of data scientist you might need to present the model to your clients who might
    have absolutely no Technical knowledge. During this, you might need to convince
    them that your model is predicting the right outcome and you need to provide some
    good reasons why they should adapt to it. You simply can’t throw the accuracy
    at them. If your algorithm is interpretable then you can show them why the model
    predicts something. Interpretability means nothing but the feature importance
    of an algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example: If you are working on a Healthcare project where your model predicts
    the disease of a person to either positive/negative. It''s a very sensitive problem
    and they can’t afford to make mistakes that is when interpretability comes in.
    If your model shows you the reason(since X feature(some levels in the body) is
    greater than x value or something) for predicting the person as positive/negative,
    it will become much easier and makes sense.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we work in realtime we might have to deal with huge amounts of data and
    if there is a requirement for low latency, that is where Time and Space Complexity
    can help you pick the right algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your model occupies more memory, to run it in real-time can get very expensive
    especially if you are using the cloud infrastructure to run the model. Sometimes
    a few business problems come with a low latency requirement where are some algorithms
    that provide good accuracy but fail to satisfy the requirement due to their limitations
    with time/Space Complexities.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Math again? Yes, yes I get it. We can use algorithms even without understanding
    the math by simply importing from Scikit learn, but let me tell this is not at
    all recommended for the long run. Well, no matter if we accept it or not we definitely
    need math for a better understanding of what really happening under the hood.
    This might disappoint a few but I got good news we can not avoid Math but we can
    simplify it and avoid rigorous math.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    (LOSS) between Actual output and Predicted Output.

    for SVM and etc.

- en: 'Note: This is not the case for every ML algorithm, this works for few algorithms
    only.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To minimize this loss, internally these algorithms use Optimization techniques
    like Gradient Descent and its other flavors which involve a little math. So if
    you are someone who is not so well with math then just try to understand the loss
    functions and its Gradient descent for each algorithm, this way you can avoid
    all other rigorous math and stay intact with the goal. once you are comfortable
    with that you can dive deep into more math stuff.

    and then slowly you try to replicate the music which is already composed by others
    and during this phase if you understand how they were able to create that music
    and tune, then the next step is to create your own music right?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the same way, We can understand the existing algorithms more clearly by implementing
    them from scratch replicating the existing one. You’ll get to learn some important
    points that can help you build better models in the future. Just remember we might
    not be able to use Scikit learn’s version of an algorithm always in our project
    due to some issues. In such cases, you’ll have to be ready to optimize or modify
    the algorithm in a way that satisfies your requirement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is easier said than done, it will take a lot of your time to reach this
    point that is why I marked this as optional. At least try to implement one algorithm
    to understand how it actually works. If you find it hard to code, break down the
    algorithm into parts and write the pseudo code first later try to convert that
    into actual code.

    the goal is not perfection but a strong foundation, trust me we can never perfect
    things goal always has to get better each day. If you could understand the gist
    of the algorithm and aware in and out of how the algorithm works then you’d definitely
    thank yourself in the long run.

    me you will be surprised. In case if you are still not able to understand something,
    search for other resources which explains it in a much easier way.
