- en: Python continues to take leading positions in solving data science tasks and
    challenges. Last year we made a [blog post](https://activewizards.com/blog/top-15-libraries-for-data-science-in-python/) overviewing
    the Python’s libraries that proved to be the most helpful at that moment. This
    year, we expanded our list with new libraries and gave a fresh look to the ones
    we already talked about, focusing on the updates that have been made during the
    year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our selection actually contains more than 20 libraries, as some of them are
    alternatives to each other and solve the same problem. Therefore we have grouped
    them as it's difficult to distinguish one particular leader at the moment.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditionally, we start our list with the libraries for scientific applications,
    and NumPy is one of the principal packages in this area. It is intended for processing
    large multidimensional arrays and matrices, and an extensive collection of high-level
    mathematical functions and implemented methods makes it possible to perform various
    operations with these objects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the year, a large number of improvements have been made to the library.
    In addition to bug fixes and compatibility issues, the crucial changes regard
    styling possibilities, namely the printing format of NumPy objects. Also, some
    functions can now handle files of any encoding that is available in Python.

- en: Another core library for scientific computing is SciPy. It is based on NumPy
    and therefore extends its capabilities. SciPy main data structure is again a multidimensional
    array, implemented by Numpy. The package contains tools that help with solving
    linear algebra, probability theory, integral calculus and many more tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SciPy faced major build improvements in the form of continuous integration into
    different operating systems, new functions and methods and, what is especially
    important - the updated optimizers. Also, many new BLAS and LAPACK functions were
    wrapped.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pandas is a Python library that provides high-level data structures and a vast
    variety of tools for analysis. The great feature of this package is the ability
    to translate rather complex operations with data into one or two commands. Pandas
    contains many built-in methods for grouping, filtering, and combining data, as
    well as the time-series functionality. All of this is followed by impressive speed
    indicators.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There have been a few new releases of the pandas library, including hundreds
    of new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and API changes. The improvements regard
    pandas abilities for grouping and sorting data, more suitable output for the *apply* method,
    and the support in performing custom types operations.

    data analysis, such as statistical models estimation, performing statistical tests,
    etc. With its help, you can implement many machine learning methods and explore
    different plotting possibilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The library is continuously developing, enriching new and new opportunities.
    Thus, this year brought time series improvements and new count models, namely
    GeneralizedPoisson, zero inflated models, and NegativeBinomialP, and new multivariate
    methods - factor analysis, MANOVA, and repeated measures within ANOVA.

- en: Matplotlib is a low-level library for creating two-dimensional diagrams and
    graphs. With its help, you can build diverse charts, from histograms and scatterplots
    to non-Cartesian coordinates graphs. Moreover, many popular plotting libraries
    are designed to work in conjunction with matplotlib.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There have been style changes in colors, sizes, fonts, legends, etc. As an example
    of an appearance improvements are an automatic alignment of axes legends and among
    significant colors improvements is a new colorblind-friendly color cycle.

    contains more suitable default settings for processing charts. Also, there is
    a rich gallery of visualizations including some complex types like time series,
    jointplots, and violin diagrams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The seaborn updates mostly cover bug fixes. However, there were improvements
    in compatibility between FacetGrid or PairGrid and enhanced interactive matplotlib
    backends, adding parameters and options to visualizations.
