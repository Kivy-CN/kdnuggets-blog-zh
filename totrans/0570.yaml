    There are a lot of people coming from widely different backgrounds, levels of
    academic degrees, and experience. The profile requirements for a “data scientist”
    differs a lot from company to company. In addition to these, we see more and more
    people adding a tagline “data scientist” to their LinkedIn profiles every day. *It
    is perhaps relatively easier to assess an experienced data scientist profile’s
    suitability for a job, but how do we evaluate a junior/entry-level data scientist
    profile?*

    graduates/certificate program pass-outs/intern candidates over the past months.
    I felt there are two important questions to ask during the interview process.
    This post is about those two questions and my rationale for asking them.

    with very good academic credentials and an impressive array of projects already
    as a student. One of the projects involved using reinforcement learning to solve
    a problem X in the Natural Language Processing domain. This was some Kaggle competition
    (as far as I remember) and the candidate was among the top XXX participants. I
    felt they did a reasonably good job of explaining what they did.

- en: 'At that point, I asked — “what will you do if you are told to not use reinforcement
    learning?” The candidate seemed surprised at the question. After some contemplation,
    they said: “deep learning.” I asked — “what in deep learning?”. Them: “Maybe RNNs.”
    Me: “Okay, let us say it was decided that we cannot use deep learning. Can you
    think of any other solution?” Them: (clueless look).'

- en: 'In this case, a popular algorithm for the problem we were discussing (this
    is found in textbooks too) uses regular expressions and simple heuristics! Now,
    one may ask, what is the point of asking this question in this era? Three reasons:'

- en: In industry projects, it often makes sense to build a quick MVP or a simple
    solution, get some feedback, and iterate over it. So, it is useful to think about
    a couple of different options to solve a problem and evaluate which one can be
    built quickly.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reinforcement learning, or Deep learning, or Regular expressions are just “methods”
    to solve problems. They should not be the solutions themselves irrespective of
    the problem.

    of a mandatory project in their course, or actually understood and thought about
    solving the problem*'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So, my point is: when we are starting out, it is useful to not stop at one
    solution, and think about “what are the other ways of solving this?”. This is
    what we normally do in a real-world job too. We look for optimal solutions under
    given constraints. While it is difficult for someone just starting out to know
    everything — part of this is also common sense.* When someone suddenly asks you
    about an alternative solution, you should have an answer in an interview. This
    is going to be very useful as one grows as a data scientist.*'

- en: Let me again take an anonymized interview experience I had. A fresh out of college
    candidate on their resume had a bunch of typical projects — spam classification,
    MNIST dataset digit recognition, sentiment analysis, etc. On one of these, the
    candidate also claimed to be in the Top-10 performers on the Kaggle leader board.
    While that is impressive, these are also so far away from real-world project scenarios.
    So, what should I do?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Instead of asking questions on the specifics of these well-known datasets and
    projects, I modified my “problem descriptions” slightly. I asked the candidate
    problem-solving questions such as: “Let us say I run an online business, and I
    frequently get customer emails complaining about something. I only have three
    customer support departments: orders and billing, returns and refunds, others.
    I want a machine learning solution which routes customer emails to one of these
    three departments.” — if someone understood the projects they did above, they
    would have mapped this to a classification problem, potentially similar to spam
    or sentiment classification. Even at an entry-level, not seeing that connection
    is a red flag for me.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*It is completely all right if all the data science projects you could show
    are standard datasets and Kaggle competitions (a few months ago, I wondered if
    this is useful, but I changed my opinion now). But, one needs to know how to generalize
    the knowledge from these to new problems.*For example, if you previously worked
    on a text classification problem, you need to be able to identify another text
    classification problem and walk through some steps in solving it.'

- en: Here too, my second point is similar to Question 1\. This tells me whether the
    candidate really understood what they did, or just followed instructions, or followed
    online tutorials.

- en: '*To summarize, when applying for data science jobs, entry-level candidates
    need to think about their projects a bit beyond the exact things they did — looking
    for other possible solutions, and for examples of similar problems in real-world
    applications.*'
