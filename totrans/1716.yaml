    to mind is the algorithm technique that needs to be applied. While, that is crucially
    important, there are many other steps in a typical data science assignment that
    requires equal attention.

    business problem/objective at hand can lead to a faulty solution and undesirable
    results. The role of data-science, if you really think about it, is to use data
    and insights from it to solve real-world problems. From that perspective, accurately
    identifying the problem and defining the objective is crucial for a successful
    outcome. In this example, the marketer wants to send customized emails to each
    of its customer showing a list of product offers curated according to the customer’s
    preferences and tastes:'

  prefs: []

- en: a. By bombarding emails to all their customers, would it leave some customers
    unhappy. e.g. the ones who do not actively shop with the retailer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: b. Since we want to show curated list of products to the customers (based on
    the individual’s preferences), so, if all 100 MM customers are taken into account,
    we may end up with a set of customers who might not show very high preference
    for any of the products (could be because they don’t shop enough with the retailer,
    and therefore, the retailer doesn’t have enough information to know their preferences)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: c. Sometimes, data processing and storage costs could also be a consideration.
    Processing 100 MM customers and their characteristics, running machine-learning
    algorithms can be quite time and resource intensive. While infrastructure could
    be available to handle that, but along with the first two considerations, it may
    make sense to exclude some customers, especially to speed up time to market.

    effective the email campaign content has been, specifically, in this case, how
    “catchy” the email subject has been. Similarly, email click through rates (after
    one has opened the email, clicks on the web links provided in the email, to land
    on the retailer’s website) shows how effective email content has been.'

    number of customers to respond (i.e. driving higher response rate), the retailer
    could be interested in driving higher spend per customer. Think of it this way
    – a campaign focused on driving more and more customers to spend could end up
    attracting customers who may buy a lot of products but of lower value, eluding
    customers who may buy less but buy high value products.

    the online retailer has) and some of their information.
  prefs: []

- en: One can see that the Gender of the 2^(nd) customer is not known. Gender can
    be powerful information, hence, if a large percentage of the customers are of
    “unknown” or “missing” gender, then we will lose a very important piece of information.
    There can be many ways to impute Gender (through the salutation or the name) and
    hence can be used for ***missing value treatment.*** Similarly, if reported annual
    income is missing (since this information is provided by the customer only and
    he/she may not be willing to provide that), we can use last 12 months spend to
    impute/predict the annual income.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Outlier treatment*** is also important. For example, we could see some very
    high values of “last 12 month spend” or “annual income”. In case of spend, it
    could be because of some one-off high dollar spending by certain customers which
    may not persist and which can bias the entire data, hence capping the spend values
    at some threshold (e.g. 99 or 95 percentile value of “last 12 month spend”) can
    help reduce such bias.'

    data that behave very differently. For example, if we look at recent customers
    (became members of the online retailer in the last 6 months), these customers
    are likely to behave in a very different manner than the rest of the customers
    (they may be very inquisitive, so email open rates could be very high, but purchase
    rates could be low). Hence mixing these customers with the rest of the customers
    can either bias the data on certain parameters or these customer’s features may
    get overshadowed by rest of the customers, reducing their representation on any
    prediction algorithm that is built. In such cases, it may make sense to build
    separate algorithms for these two ***“data segments”*** (new customers and remaining
    customers)

    e.g. in image recognition like the Pokemon image below, each image can have hundreds
    of features (pixels). So, any image recognition algorithm has to deal with a huge
    number of features from multiple images. Hence, the algorithm has to be able to
