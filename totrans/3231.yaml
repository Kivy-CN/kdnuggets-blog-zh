    now. You pour yourself a cup of coffee, check the news, and then put on a pair
    of AR glasses. You find yourself surrounded by a sea of gently glowing, colored
    orbs. The orbs represent all of the data that drives your business. You know this
    data well. The patterns and colors of these orbs are like a fingerprint. But there's
    something atypical about the data floating over the coffee maker. You reach out
    and select that data. A summary of all the relevant details appears on a nearby
    computer screen.

  prefs: []

- en: Data can have a lot of attributes. Take, for example, Instacart's open source
    data set on grocery purchases. Each person in this data set can be thought of
    as a data-point. Each of those data-points can be described by a list of purchased
    products. That's over 50,000 possible products for each user.

    to one another. But how can we begin to make sense of so much data?

- en: Oftentimes, when Data Scientists first get a data set, they'll use a matrix
    of 2D scatter plots to quickly overview the contents. 2D scatter plots show the
    relationships between pairs of attributes. But for data with lots of attributes,
    that type of analysis just doesn't scale.

    This makes it possible to use immersive visualization techniques as an extension
    of typical data-analysis workflows. It's relatively easy to bounce back and forth
    between R, Python, and Immersive Insights.

    learning models. If Data Scientists used this process to understand the embedded
    relationships in their data, it could help them improve their ML features and

- en: First, data was prepared in a python notebook. View that code [*here*](https://apsportal.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/e0e24014-f59d-4758-b819-d462534b8d87/view?access_token=e9e3d81e924a5069dd5fa4193dbab154a631fd69ec462ce8eaa80bb7f2c8e984).

- en: Instacart's users were modeled with a vector which describes their relationship
    to every product that they could potentially purchase. This vector took the form
    of a sparse array of 0s and 1s. Each 1 corresponds to a product that had been
    purchased at least once by that user. Each 0 corresponds to an unpurchased product.
    This technique is called "[one-hot-encoding](https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-hot-encoding-and-when-is-it-used-in-data-science)".
    Then, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is performed on the data in order to
    describe each user with just three numbers, or "[principal components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)".
    Each principal component summarizes an aspect of variance in the data. In practice,
    I could only analyze 120,000 users due to memory constraints while performing
    PCA. After performing PCA, the prepped data is exported to CSV.

- en: Next, data is sent to a headset for visualization through a separate R notebook.
    View that code [*here*](https://apsportal.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/33a4910b-4e11-48a7-9e55-7e9691073f4c/view?access_token=912ad4d832e2cc67b2d734d5b305aba3c84230043700ec7d53ec2cfafa7a414d).

- en: The R notebook color-codes users according to various criteria that could affect
    the user distribution in latent space. Users were color-coded according to the
    department from which they ordered stuff most frequently (e.g. frozen food, snacks,
    produce). An alternate color-coding scheme indicated whether users had purchased
    any organic food. I also referenced the IDs of various users in Immersive Insights,
    and then looked up their purchase history in the R notebook. This allowed me to
    gain an intuition for what types of product purchases resulted in users being
    placed in different areas of the latent space.

- en: 'Users who didn''t purchase any organic foods were tightly clustered within
    the latent space. This finding was a compelling piece of evidence which supported
    a qualitative observation drawn from the visualization: much of the variance in
    Instacart purchasing patterns appears to be between users who purchase premium
    items, and users who prefer lower cost versions of similar items. This difference
    between cost conscientious and premium purchasers has meaningful implications
    for Instacart''s marketing, promotional, and recommendation strategies.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also found that Instacart users buy far more produce than any other category
    of item. There are many different types of users who love produce. Almost everyone
    buys produce!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When users are categorized according to the most common department from which
    they had purchased items (the mode department), they were not linearly separable.
    We found that, while helpful in understanding some relationships between user
    purchasing patterns, this type of categorization appears to miss much of the variance
    described by the dataset' three principle components.
