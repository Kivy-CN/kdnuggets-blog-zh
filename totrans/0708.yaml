- en: Bayesian thinking is a way to make decisions using probability. It starts with
    initial beliefs (priors) and changes them when new evidence comes in (posterior).
    This helps in making better predictions and decisions based on data. It’s crucial
    in fields like AI and statistics where accurate reasoning is important.

- en: Bayesian inference updates beliefs when things are uncertain. It uses Bayes’
    theorem to adjust initial beliefs based on new information. This approach combines
    what’s known before with new data effectively. This approach quantifies uncertainty
    and adjusts probabilities accordingly. In this way, it continuously improves predictions
    and understanding as more evidence is gathered. It’s useful in decision-making
    where uncertainty needs to be managed effectively.

    new treatments. They combine prior beliefs from past studies or with current data.
    This updates the probability of how well the treatment works. Researchers can
    then make better decisions using old and new information.'

- en: Predictive modeling and uncertainty quantification involve making predictions
    and understanding how confident we are in those predictions. It uses techniques
    like Bayesian methods to account for uncertainty and provide probabilistic forecasts.
    Bayesian modeling is effective for predictions because it manages uncertainty.
    It doesn’t just predict outcomes but also indicates our confidence in those predictions.
    This is achieved through posterior distributions, which quantify uncertainty.

- en: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are neural networks that provide probabilistic
    outputs. They offer predictions along with measures of uncertainty. Instead of
    fixed parameters, BNNs use probability distributions for weights and biases. This
    allows BNNs to capture and propagate uncertainty through the network. They are
    beneficial for tasks requiring uncertainty measurement and decision-making. They
    are used in classification and regression.
