    of course! More specifically, automated machine learning is the use of automated
    techniques, be they learned methods or simple heuristics, used for algorithm selection,
    hyperparameter tuning, architecture design, or any other conceivable portion of
    a machine learning implementation.

    is one of the greatest characters to ever grace the silver screen. [Raiders of
    the Lost Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark), the first
    movie in which the character was featured, is a personal favorite, film adored
    by millions. The rest of the (current) quadrilogy movies run alternately hot and
    cold, but even the poorest quality Indiana Jones is better than 95% of available
    cinema.

    really. But we are going to co-opt the concept of his first film — the idea of
    marauding for something of value (an ancient relic in that case) — and apply it
    to searching GitHub for open source repositories of value.

    for linear machine learning algorithms, ensemble approaches, and/or neural networks.
    They are all connected in that they are all Python projects, or at the very least
    have Python APIs.
