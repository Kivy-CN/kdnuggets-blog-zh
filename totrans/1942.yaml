    I wrote that thanks to Big Data, analytics has become inescapable, and looking
    now into 2015, I believe that statement more than ever.

    into the spotlight, and the hiring market for analytics professionals and data
    scientists has gone into overdrive. Despite [salary increases](http://www.burtchworks.com/big-data-analyst-salary/big-data-career-tips/the-burtch-works-study/)
    companies are still struggling to hire, and talented professionals are going on
    and off the market almost faster than you can snap your fingers. While it is still
    crucial to [keep your job search skills sharp](http://www.burtchworks.com/2014/12/08/8-biggest-job-search-mistakes-quants-still-making/),
    there has never been a better time to be a Quant looking for a job.

    but that is the direction that business is going. The complexity of managing any
    large organization effectively has escalated dramatically, and success in the
    future is going to depend on how “Big Data” savvy any C-level leader is.'

    data science trend gaining momentum, I predict that legacy firms will build up
    their data science teams. Whereas last year there was still some confusion and
    hesitation, this year will see more investment, and a plan of attack for hiring.
    The amount of calls I’ve received from companies asking questions has risen substantially,
    and I anticipate it will continue long into 2015\. From tech firms like Google,
    LinkedIn, Amazon, or Uber, to legacy firms like the Gap, Zurich Insurance, General
    Motors, Clorox, and AIG, organizations in every industry are boarding the data
    science bandwagon.'

    king-pins of the Big Data movement, are on the West Coast working for technology
    and gaming companies. But, cities in California account for [nine out of the top
    ten cities](http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/11/12/outside-california-america-priciest-houses-are-wellesley/6DHPR1RJBip1w56Pha5O6K/story.html)
    with the highest average home prices in the US, and the rent is also very high.
    However, the biggest reason that I’m predicting the California craze dies down
    is that professionals will start to realize that there are plenty of high-paying
    jobs outside The Golden State that might offer more opportunities to make a measurable
    impact, advance their career, or to lead the Big Data initiative at their company
    rather than being “just another Quant” at one of the larger tech firms.'

    and the hype has just barely begun to subside, but I predict that next year startups’
    ability to attract rock-star talent will diminish. Professionals will be less
    apt to blindly leap into a startup hoping for a lottery win as they see many of
    their colleagues bombing out.'

    analytics professionals get accustomed to working with unstructured data, I believe
    there will be a natural evolution of analytics, with more analytics professionals
    picking up the skills necessary to work with the unstructured data that is common
    in data science. Want to know what it takes to be a data scientist? Here’s [my
    list of essential data science skills](http://www.burtchworks.com/2014/11/17/must-have-skills-to-become-a-data-scientist/)

    are looking for a faster way to bring people up to speed, and professionals hoping
    to pick up new skills are looking for a quick primer. It remains to be seen how
    successful these programs will be in preparing their students, but they are a
    faster, cheaper way to transition as long as you have a strong quantitative foundation.
    Check out [this post](http://www.burtchworks.com/2014/08/04/becoming-a-data-scientist-masters-program-bootcamp-or-moocs/)

    then Hadoop is on its way out of the Big Data conversation. Aside from Hortonworks’
    recent IPO, the buzz I’ve been hearing is all about Spark. Programming languages
    like R and Python are ubiquitous, and I believe that the future lies in open source
    tools; as always keeping your tools fresh is crucial to success in this quickly
    evolving field.'
