- en: 1\. Use a Smaller Base Image
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, you can start with a smaller base image to create minimal images. This
    reduces the overall size of the Docker image and speeds up the build process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, when containerizing Python apps, you can start with a `python:3.x-slim`
    image, a smaller version of `python:3.x`, containing only the essential components
    needed to run Python instead of the default `python:3.x`.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The order of instructions in a Dockerfile influences the build times due to
    how Docker leverages its build cache.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Docker builds images by executing instructions in the Dockerfile sequentially—creating
    a new image layer for each instruction. If a layer hasn't changed since the last
    build, Docker can reuse the cached layer, speeding up the build process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So it’s important to **optimize the order of instructions to maximize cache
    hits**:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Place frequently changing instructions last**: Place instructions that change
    often, such as copying the application code towards the end of the Dockerfile.
    This reduces the chances of invalidating the cache for the entire build.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Place less frequently changing instructions early**: Instructions like installing
    OS packages, setting environment variables, and installing dependencies (if dependencies
    don''t change often) should be placed early to maximize cache hits.'

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this optimized Dockerfile, if there's a change in the application code, Docker
    can still use the cached layers for installing dependencies. This way, changes
    to application code do not unnecessarily trigger reinstallation of dependencies.

- en: 3\. Use Multi-Stage Builds
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Multi-stage builds allow you to separate the build environment from the final
    runtime environment, which can reduce the size of the final image by only including
    necessary runtime dependencies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Consider the following Dokcerfile with multi-stage build:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE2]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this example, the build dependencies are installed in the `builder` stage,
    and only the necessary runtime dependencies are copied to the final image.

- en: 4\. Minimize Build Context with .dockerignore Files
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensure you have a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from being
    copied into the Docker context, reducing the build time. Similar to `.gitignore`,
    this file tells Docker which files to ignore during the build process, reducing
    the context size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the `.dockerignore` file, you can include temporary files, virtual environments,
    IDE settings, and other unnecessary files that you do not want included in the
    build context.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From reducing the base image size to optimizing the build context, these optimizations
    should help you make your Docker builds more efficient.
