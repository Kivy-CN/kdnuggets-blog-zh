    worth analyzing is influenced by human behavior. Cyber attacks are highly impacted
    by disgruntled employees who may either ignore due diligence or engage in [insider
    misuse](https://www.ca.com/content/dam/ca/us/files/ebook/insider-threat-report.pdf).
    The stock market depends on the effect of the economic climate, which itself is
    dependent on the aggregate behavior of the masses. In the field of communication,
    it is common knowledge that [what we say account for only 7% of the message while
    the rest 93% is encoded in facial expressions and other non-verbal cues](http://www.nonverbalgroup.com/2011/08/how-much-of-communication-is-really-nonverbal).
    Entire fields of psychology and behavioral economics are dedicated to this field.
    That being said, the ability to measure and analyze emotions effectively will
    enable us to improve society in remarkable ways. For example, a psychology professor
    at the University of California, San Francisco, [Paul Ekman](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/paul-ekman),
    describes in his book, [*Telling Lies: Clues to Deceit in the Marketplace, Politics,
    and Marriage*](https://www.amazon.com/Telling-Lies-Marketplace-Politics-Marriage-ebook/dp/B00ECXIF6C),
    how reading facial expression can help psychologists find signs of potential suicide
    attempts while the patient lies about such intentions. Sounds like a job for facial
    recognition models? What about neural mapping? Can we effectively map emotional
    states from neural impulses? What about improving cognitive abilities? Or even
    emotional intelligence and effective communication? There are plenty of problems
    in the world to solve using the vast array of unstructured data that is available
    to us.'

    men and women is fueled by embarrassment and too little face time with doctors.
    One digital health platform, [ZocDoc](https://www.zocdoc.com/about/news/new-zocdoc-study-reveals-women-are-more-likely-than-men-to-lie-to-doctors/),
    reveals that nearly half (46%) of Americans have avoided telling their doctor
    about a health issue because they were embarrassed or afraid of being judged.
    Around a third say they withheld details because they couldn’t find the right
    opportunity or didn’t have enough time during the appointment (27%) or because
    the doctor didn’t ask any questions or specifically if anything was bothering
    them (32%). A major impact of this is in the field of suicide. According to the [World
    Health Organization](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression) (WHO),
    as many as 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, with 60 percent facing
    major [depression](https://www.verywellmind.com/suicide-rates-overstated-in-people-with-depression-2330503).
    Even though depression places a patient at a higher risk of engaging in suicidal

    is not easy to detect.

    All people experience emotions, but it is a select few who can accurately identify
    them as they occur. It could either be a lack of self-awareness or simply our
    limited emotional vocabulary. Many times, we don’t even know what we want. We
    strive to connect with those around us in a specific way or consume a particular
    product, just so we could feel a very unique emotion that we fail to describe.
    We feel much more than just happiness, sadness, anger, anxiety or fear. Our emotions
    are complex combinations of all of the above. The ability to understand our own
    emotions as well as those of people around us is vital for the emotional well
    being and maintaining positive relationships.
