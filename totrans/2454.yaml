    better off learning regression analysis over deep learning. Why? Because time
    is a limited resource and how you allocate your time will determine how far you
    in your learning journey.

    analysis before deep learning.

    regression**.

    methods that are used to estimate the relationships between dependent and independent
    variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A big misconception, however, is that regression analysis solely refers to
    linear regression, **which** **is not the case. **There are so many statistical
    techniques within regression analysis that are extremely powerful and useful.
    This leads me to my first point:'

- en: '**Regression analysis allows you to understand the strength of relationships
    between variables**. Using statistical measurements like R-squared/adjusted R-squared,
    regression analysis can tell you how much of the total variability in the data

    significant and which are not**. In simpler terms, if you give a regression model
    50 features, you can find out which features are good predictors for the target
    variable and which aren’t.'

- en: '**Regression analysis can give a confidence interval for each regression coefficient
    that it estimates**. Not only can you estimate a single coefficient for each feature,
    but you can also get a range of coefficients with a level of confidence (e.g.,
    99% confidence) that the coefficient is in.'

    analysis that allow you to answer many more questions than just “Can we predict
    Y given X(s)?”

    how **interpretable** it is.
  prefs: []

    and how to interpret the results of a model.

- en: For example, it’s likely that most business users will understand the sum of
    least squares (i.e., line of best fit) much faster than backpropagation. This
    is important because businesses are interested in how the underlying logic in
    a model works — nothing is worse in a business than uncertainty — and a black
    box is a great synonym for that.

    and how they can be interpreted.
