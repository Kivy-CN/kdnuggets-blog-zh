    with the best sporting content they can produce. Given the sheer amount of people
    regularly tuning in to sporting events, be it on TV or on the field, video content
    producers take their best shots at making content that catches as many eyes as
    possible.

    the field. Now, anyone who can put up a highlight compilation or a game summarization
    first gets the edge.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to generating [sports video highlights](https://cognitivemill.com/resources/blog/football-and-basketball-highlights-generation/),
    it’s a manual process for the most part. Sports broadcasters have large teams
    of editors who produce sports-related content for said broadcasters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Usually, the process goes like this: the editor gets the footage of the whole
    game along with the data feed pointing to the memorable events. Then they go on
    to look through it and cut the clips containing all of the goals, pitches and
    dunks any sports fan would love along with some drama.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then the editor compiles the clips into a single sequence, adds graphics, music,
    and transitions. That can be then posted on social media or broadcasted on TV
    to draw in more viewers.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the length of sporting events, it takes editors hours to make a single
    highlight compilation video. Add in the fact that the sports seasons can be tightly
    packed with events happening back to back — and you have a ton of work on your
    plate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On top of that, compilation videos can serve different purposes for the broadcaster,
    from recapping the best moments on the air or on the internet for those who missed
    the game to putting them on social media or advertisements for promotional reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, sometimes there’s a need for several sports video highlights from a single
    game, which means even more time in front of the screen for editors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The thing is that the editors don’t really have a lot of time to work with:
    with media, the first one to put out the content usually gets the attention. The
    quality of said clips, though very important, is rendered non-relevant if the
    clips are late.'

    moments automatically.

    Let’s see what those approaches are.

    but how the audience reacts to it. That approach is utilized by WSC Sports.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By analyzing the sound, the algorithm picks up on anything out of the ordinary,
    like an audience cheering, or a referee arguing with a player — and chooses the
    respective clips to be included in the compilation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that approach may not be ideal for sports with less vocal audiences — for
    example, there are no cheering crowds during a golf game.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to be. During the COVID-related lockdowns, the sports events were held with now
    spectators.
  prefs: []

    to the team or mascots doing their mascot things may not get included in the AI
    highlight.
