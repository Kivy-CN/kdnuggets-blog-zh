    at top tech companies. They use their powers for good, building products, spotting
    trends, and even actively working to stop hackers. For example, a new field of
    data science called [Phishitycs](/2020/03/phishytics-machine-learning-detecting-phishing-websites.html)
    uses machine learning to stop phishing attacks.

    using their skills to spot and help companies shore up weaknesses to earn bounties.

    it as a tool to steal corporate data, personal data, privacy invasion, or any
    other important information that can harm the business.

- en: It shouldn’t come as a surprise. The data science field and the hacking field
    have a lot in common, despite being on opposite sides of legality. Data science
    requires a lot of thinking outside the box, problem-solving, and analytical thinking.
    So does hacking.

    are using data science - and how they can be stopped.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most common - and most successful - types of hacking is imitating
    other humans at the company to gain access to emails, secure servers, and more.
    This type of hacking includes spoofing, phishing, spear phishing, and impersonation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hackers have begun using machine learning to better imitate human speech and
    text patterns. Just as machine learning can be used to [help natural language
    processing progress](/2019/05/guide-natural-language-processing-nlp.html) as a
    field, the same skills can be used to make hackers sound more realistic.

    using social networks. Then she might successfully impersonate your CTO, getting
    you to click on a malicious link.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Artificial intelligence and machine learning can use clever ransomware and malware
    that are increasingly adaptive against threats.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One issue a lot of companies face is that their security systems are passive
    and reactive, rather than active. As hackers have built malware that is more and
    more intelligent and has the ability to recognize security software and adapt
    to it accordingly to remain hidden, companies must develop their own intelligent
    security systems.

    companies [a total of $20 billion](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-true-cost-of-ransomware/),
    a number that has been steadily increasing over the past few years.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everyone is familiar with ticking the box that confirms you’re not a bot, called
    CAPTCHAs. Most of us are familiar with the slightly annoying and weirdly sad collection
    of pictures that come afterward, asking us to identify the traffic light, boat,
    train, or other random objects in a grid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even more annoying than me, a human, being asked to prove I’m not a bot is the
    realization that a bot can probably do that, too. Nowadays, anyone who’s used
    Google’s search functionality through images should know that machine learning
    and algorithms can be used to train bots that are capable of overcoming these
    security measures.
  prefs: []

- en: “There are many ways to get past the text CAPTCHAs on their own. Researchers
    demonstrated how they could write a program that beats image recognition tests.
    CAPTCHAs can irritate users, who find themselves stuck on a webpage while waiting
    for the CAPTCHA test. In some cases, this leads them to feel discouraged and give
    up altogether,” [writes](https://techgenix.com/how-captchas-know-if-you-are-a-bot/)

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DoS (Denial of Service) or DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks are
    among the most famous hacker accomplishments in the news lately. Hackers will
    overwhelm the bandwidth or infrastructure of their target with a flood of simulated
    web traffic. This makes it hard or impossible for real visitors to use the site,
    disrupting commerce.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest attack was [on Google back in 2017](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/identifying-and-protecting-against-the-largest-ddos-attacks)
    - though they only disclosed the attack in 2020.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While DoS attacks can use a single device, sturdier DDoS attacks rely on a network
    of “zombies,” which are devices infected with a particular malware that allows
    a hacker to remotely control their activity. These DDoS attacks rely on algorithms
    to coordinate these attacks together. As the IoT has become more widespread, hackers
    have grown more proficient at infecting just about any device, from a company
    server to the wifi-enabled fridge.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reading the list above, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Luckily, for every hacker,
    there is a data science working diligently to stop them. The same tools can be
    flipped around and made to protect companies rather than infiltrate them. Not
    only that but a lot of attacks can be stopped with training and common sense.
    Here are three ways to rebuff modern hackers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Invest in the right technology
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hackers evolved when companies began moving to the cloud since a lot of security
    issues arise when a company moves to the cloud, which improves service but causes
    greater security threats. To address this weakness, many companies are upgrading
    too, using a secure access service edge, or [SASE](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/network-security/what-is-secure-access-service-edge-sase/).
    Being able to customize security settings and operational needs means companies
    can flexibly build a security architecture that works for them.

- en: 2\. Get proactive
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies should aim to build more proactive and predictive security models
    rather than the reactive models that are the standard today. Companies can feed
    machine learning algorithms with historical and current information about cyber
    intrusions to predict and detect these, working as the human immune system to
    identify threats even as they shift.
  prefs: []

- en: 3\. Focus on the people, not the machines
  prefs:

- en: One of my favorite folktales about hackers is when a class of future computer
    scientists was asked to try to hack into their university servers. Most were unable
    to detect any vulnerabilities or get past the powerful firewalls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One woman, however, put on a fake lanyard and simply tried to walk into the
    building where the servers were kept. She pretended her lanyard didn’t work and
    was let through the doors by a helpful employee. Once inside, she pretended she
    had forgotten the password to log in and asked for it. Again, she was able to
    get inside the systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Her skill wasn’t technical, but psychological. Many hackers rely on the same
    skillset. So many of these hackers can be stopped by reducing human error. Don’t
    click on the link in the email. Don’t download the attachment. Don’t trust what
    you read. With that alone, you can eliminate many of the hackers’ attempts to
    get inside.
