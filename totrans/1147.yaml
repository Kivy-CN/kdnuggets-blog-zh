- en: When I landed my first data science internship, I hadn’t graduated yet. I was
    pursuing a computer science degree but managed to get the job even before showing
    the employer any of my grades or academic transcripts. I got this role only around
    four months into teaching myself data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have now transitioned into a full-time role at the same company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only way I managed to land this job was with the help of my data science
    portfolio.
  prefs: []

- en: In the past year alone, I’ve received multiple data science job offers from
    organizations all over the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m currently taking on some freelance jobs while also working full time and
    would never have had these opportunities without the portfolio I’ve built for
    myself.
  prefs: []

- en: When I first started teaching myself data science, I experimented with datasets
    on Kaggle — simple ones, like the Boston House Pricing Dataset and the Titanic
    Dataset.

    and the topics didn’t really excite me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wanted to work on something I found interesting, so I went online and tried
    looking for datasets on topics that excited me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After some time, I came up with a data science project idea. However, I wasn’t
    able to find pre-existing datasets that had all the information I required to
    start building the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I had to collect data on my own with the help of APIs and web scraping tools,
    clean the data, and then build a data frame from there. This entire process helped
    me understand the different data collection techniques I could use to collect
    data from the web.
  prefs: []

- en: The project proved to be a lot harder than I thought, but I learned a lot along
    the way. I started to get a better grasp of Python and its libraries.

    repository.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, I wasn’t satisfied with just sharing the source code to my project.
    I wanted to share my findings and the technique I used to collect the data. I
    wanted to tell a story about all the work I did.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I started writing articles explaining the steps taken to create my project.
    I submitted these articles to a data science publication.
  prefs: []

- en: After creating around 3–4 projects, I built a portfolio website. This website
    included a basic description of the project, along with the associated source
    code and article I wrote about it.
  prefs: []

- en: This was a way for me to showcase all my work in one place so that anyone who
    had a link to my site could see everything I’d worked on.
  prefs: []

- en: My portfolio website was the only reason I got an internship within the first
    few months of learning data science.

    outside of work, building projects, and writing articles about them.
  prefs: []

- en: As I started to reach a larger audience through my writing, I’ve had recruiters,
    and data scientists contact me based on projects I’d written about. I started
    freelancing and building data science projects for clients on a contract basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of my day job.
  prefs: []

    write for publications on a freelance basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My portfolio comprises projects I’ve worked on, my blog, testimonies, and clients
    I’ve worked with. Most of these opportunities have come my way because I have
    had the opportunity to share my work with the world through writing.
  prefs: []

- en: If you are a beginner in the data science industry, I suggest learning new things
    and writing about them. Write tutorials about concepts you just learned.
  prefs: []

- en: If you have a data science project idea, bring the project to life. It might
    take days, weeks, or even months to do this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve successfully built the project, share it with the rest of the world.
    Break it down into layman terms and explain everything you did.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will spark the interest of recruiters when you apply for a data science
    job. It will also distinguish you from other applicants who only have online certificates
    listed on their resumes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating projects is also a great way to learn and hone your data science skills.
    If you’ve taken a data science course or two, then it’s time to put your programming
    and machine learning skills to use by building something you are passionate about.
