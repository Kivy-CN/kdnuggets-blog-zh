    So it's not surprising that organizations are looking for skilled MLOps engineers.
    But what does an MLOps engineer do?

- en: The [role of the MLOps engineer](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/04/role-mlops-engineer-organization.html)
    is fluid and varies from one organization to the other. However, it is both convincing
    and simple to think of an MLOps engineer to be more end-to-end than a data scientist.
    Meaning their job goes beyond building machine learning models—with roles in model
    building, deployment and monitoring amongst others.
