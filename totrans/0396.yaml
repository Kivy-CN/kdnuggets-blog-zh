- en: Not long ago, I started thinking if I had to start learning machine learning
    and data science all over again, where would I start? The funny thing was that
    the path that I imagined was completely different from that one that I actually
    did when I was starting.

    OK with just books, and a lot of people need to pay for a course to feel more
    pressure. And that’s OK because the important thing is to learn and enjoy it.

    each ML model. But from my perspective, starting with something practical and
    concrete helps to have a better view of the whole picture.

    are not going to be a linear process, as you are probably going to have to come
    and go between them to refresh concepts. When you are working in the Pandas one,
    you may have to go back to the Python course to remember some of the things you
    learned or go to the pandas documentation to understand new functions that you
    saw in the Introduction to Machine Learning course. And all of this is fine, right
    here is where the real learning is going to happen.

    to do exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create baseline models that later you
    will be able to improve. So, now is the right time to start with simple Kaggle
    competitions and put into practice what you’ve learned.

    you will learn about classification and relevant metrics for these types of problems
    such as precision, recall and accuracy.

    of each of the topics, and it doesn’t have much heavy math, which is fundamental
    for this stage. We want to understand the principle of the algorithms, but with
    a practical perspective, we don’t want to be demotivated by reading a lot of dense
    mathematical notation.
