    on a new comprehensive study that goes into an analysis of **over 70,000+ B2B
    SaaS sales calls.**

    kind to date.

    which you move a deal to the next step toward closing, such as from “demo” to
    “proposal” to “close.”

    probability your opportunity will advance if competition is mentioned at least
    1X in the early stages of a process.

    companies averaging 25%+ average close rates to the companies I know averaging
    10% close rates when look at their onboarding programs.

    On the flipside, the companies who breeze through competitor education I see averaging
    lower close rates.

    and be ready to discuss it with prospective buyers. It could mean up to a 50%

    that they often tell me they feel *uncomfortable* asking more of these clarification
    questions once a buyer has already told them their problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or “too inexperienced” to ask executives these questions.

    that makes you an expert in your own right.

    can get them to open up. If you’re not sure where to start, [this presentation

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What [Gong.io](https://www.gong.io/?source=ssb) found from these 72,326 calls
    is that if you pitch your company more than 2 minutes, you’re basically walking
    your close rate off a cliff.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on how fast the modern buyer journey is changing, I’d predict this 2 minute
    cliff number will *decrease* over the next year — especially in technology sales.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data suggests that if you spend 10% of a call discussing your company, your
    odds of closing the deal will be 1/4 of your peers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means, if the top sales rep on your team has a 24% close-rate, and you’re
    a talker, your close-rate is likely to be a mere 6%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So yes, you can literally talk your close rate off a cliff.

    and you’ll hurt your close rate.'
