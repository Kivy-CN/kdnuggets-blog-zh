- en: Data scientists are set to [remain in high demand](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/data-science/quant-crunch.html)
    over the coming years. Whether you’re in this field already or hoping to break
    into it soon, it’s obvious thriving here requires constant learning. The speed
    with which the world’s data analysis infrastructures have improved their reach
    and usefulness has been remarkable — but it’s also reinforced the necessity of
    openness and accountability.

    changing field known as open data, while others muse on the ethical implications
    of a digitally connected world. Each one is a useful and enlightening read for
    data scientists everywhere.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Pat Morin’s [*Open Data Structures: An Introduction*](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Data-Structures-Introduction-Enriched/dp/1927356385),
    from CreateSpace Independent Publishing, is an excellent place for the uninitiated
    to begin their journey into open data. The book explores how to analyze data structures
    in a variety of contexts, including sequences, priority queues, graphs, stacks
    and ordered and unordered dictionaries.'

    after all — and the book makes sure to include Java source code for each major
    component. Readers should find this an accessible, practical and mathematically
    focused way to ease into this complex but fascinating topic. It’s intended for
    all self-learners as well as undergraduate students.

- en: Globalization is a fraught and controversial concept, but nobody questions how
    mobile and global our data has become. For anybody who wants an extremely modern
    take on the intersection of globalization and open data analysis, it makes sense
    to turn to thought leaders. Hailing from NYU’s GovLab, authors Verhulst and Young
    have put together [an O’Reilly guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-global-impact/9781492042785/)
    that will appeal to data scientists, policymakers, small business owners and privacy
    activists alike.

- en: The case studies in this text should be especially compelling for the data science
    crowd. A future where data is open, shareable and truly useful is a future where
    technologists work hand in hand with public and private entities to solve mutual
    challenges, devise new standards and APIs and employ data science to better understand
    weather and climate, and even plot and predict public health crises.

    is a must-read for privacy-minded data scientists. Gone are the days when citizens
    remained in the dark about how their digital lives get surveilled, mined for profitable
    insights and even sold to unknown third parties. It’s not just our web browsing
    habits, either — the panoply of connected devices we rely on represent, essentially,
    a global surveillance network. Whether or not people use this network for pro-social
    objectives relies on the intentions of those tasked with building it.

    financial and health care entities and even the educational community. He argues
    that big data and data science are tools for positive change, but that we haven’t
    yet laid down a common framework to reconcile the needs of big business with the
    right to online privacy. This book proposes ways to “make data work for us.” And
    “us” means “everybody.”

    Consequences" — Rob Kitchin**'

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As it explores how quickly the worldwide data landscape is changing and reinventing
    itself, this book never loses focus on the distinctions between big data and open
    data. Rob Kitchin’s [*The Data Revolution*](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Revolution-Infrastructures-Their-Consequences/dp/1446287483),
    despite its title, cuts through a lot of the hype and hyperbole surrounding data
    infrastructures and analysis — and supports its arguments about the modern-day
    landscape with brief looks backward at how the many pieces all came together.
  prefs: []

- en: The “revolution” explored here involves the variety, breadth and accessibility
    of data among businesses, regulatory agencies, local and national governments,
    lobbyists, journalists and more. The book presents more of a “consequentialist”
    reading of modern trends in open data, making it an important resource for scientists
    who want to know more about the civic, ethical and political implications of a
    world that transmits and analyzes information on an unprecedented scale.

    Now*](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Data-Now-Investing-Innovation/dp/0071829776).
    Having worked with nonprofits, journalists, governments and as an executive VP
    at *Consumer Reports*, Gurin sees open data as a tool that can help organizations
    of all kinds launch new projects and products and better understand how data can
    spur innovation and helps achieve a better connection with audiences.

    also need to know how those skills can apply to making more data-driven decisions
    in investing, developing startups, R&D, community organizing, interfacing with
    the public and much more. This book is ideal for decision-makers and data scientists
    alike, since it thinks “big picture” and presents credible strategies for engaging
    in data analysis in a collaborative, ethical and consequential manner.

    smart city and automotive technologies of the future. The rise of telecommuting,
    the urgency of displacing combustion engines with electric and the challenge of
    bringing autonomy to commercial and personal vehicles means the future of urban
    planning will look vastly different than it does today.

    vital role data scientists can play in bringing it to fruition. This book delves
    into the ways researchers and transportation technologists can use databases and
    mathematical models to better understand the world’s transportation problems and
    come up with practical, scalable and inclusive solutions.'
