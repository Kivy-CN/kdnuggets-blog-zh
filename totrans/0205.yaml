    jobs, it adds them. Yes, word processors made typists obsolete. And before that,
    cars made carriage drivers obsolete. But the overall number of jobs – good jobs,
    fun jobs, engaging jobs – has increased over time, despite the rapid influx of
    new technology.

- en: Why is this? Think about how AI generates images to use as an example. Midjourney
    has been trained on millions of images taken from all parts of the web. To each
    image, there is some text associated. An image of a woman smiling will be described
    as a “woman smiling.” A Raphaelite work of art will be described with the name,
    the style, and the contents of the painting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you ask Midjourney to generate a painting of a woman smiling in the Raphaelite
    style, it is putting all its training data into a blender and spitting out the
    composite result. That’s not innovative or creative. The AI is not “thinking”
    or “reasoning” to create that image. It is just using pattern recognition to follow
    your prompt.

    by a song created by ChatGPT in his style. In explaining why, he showed understanding
    that what ChatGPT does is ‘mimicry, or replication, or pastiche’. And this is
    everything writing a good song isn’t. Then he explained what it is:”It is an act
    of self-murder that destroys all one has strived to produce in the past. It is
    those dangerous, heart-stopping departures that catapult the artist beyond the
    limits of what he or she recognises as their known self.” In that, I think Nick
    Cave explained the difference between a human and an AI. The way I read it is
    we should distinguish between generating and creating. All AI does is generate,
    while humans have the ability to create.'

- en: It seems ChatGPT agrees with Nick! I asked it to write a blog post about whether
    AI will ever be used to replace software engineers. It can chew up thousands of
    blog posts it’s read on the subject and spit out the best approximation of that.
    It is not considering your question and thinking about how best to respond. It’s
    just using the training data to complete your prompt.

    Aside from writing Python code to generate five random numbers, there’s a lot
    more than AI can do. And most of these skills fall under the umbrella of “make
    my job more interesting and less drudgework-based.”

    a lot of time optimizing blog posts for search engines. (We do this to help interested
    readers find our blog posts more easily.) This can be a little mind-numbing. Our
    writers like to focus on making a blog post interesting, informative, and fun.
    It’s less fun to ensure a blog post has an optimal number of keywords to reach
    readers.

    conveying information because it has already scanned more text than any human
    could ever read in a lifetime. For instance, ChatGPT can explain to me how a camera
    works, how planes fly, or even quantum mechanics.

    findings into a simple response to you.

    good at helping medical professionals make a diagnosis. While most clinicians
    will still prefer to speak with patients to get a holistic view of their symptoms,
    an AI assistant can monitor blood pressure and match symptoms with potential illnesses.

    bought the “Watson” AI that could beat Jeopardy! contestants to use it to diagnose
    patients. Ultimately, the AI had too much trouble with complex patient files,
    and it was unable to make reliable diagnoses. But as AI gets better at ingesting
    complicated and varied sources of information, and as clinicians get more used
    to relying on AI to interpret medical scans and symptoms, this is an area where
    AI could make a difference and save lives.

    technology. The more I used it, the more it became clear that what I do, as the
