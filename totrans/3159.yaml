- en: After a hiatus, the "[Overlook...](https://www.kdnuggets.com/tag/overlook)"
    posts are making their comeback this month, continuing the modest quest of bringing
    formidable, lesser-known [machine learning projects](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/03/20-machine-learning-datasets-project-ideas.html)
    to a few additional sets of eyes.

  prefs: []

- en: What is skift?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: skift includes several scikit-learn-compatible wrappers for the fastText Python
    package which cater to these use cases.
  prefs:

- en: What is [fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText)?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fastText is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence
    classification.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fastText works only on text data, which means that it will only use a single
    column from a dataset which might contain many feature columns of different types.
    As such, a common use case is to have the fastText classifier use a single column
    as input, ignoring other columns. This is especially true when fastText is to
    be used as one of several classifiers in a stacking classifier, with other classifiers
    using non-textual features.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding fastText is the important piece of the puzzle, but once this understanding
    is possessed, skift helps you easily implement fastText, as well as integrate
    it with other Scikit-learn functionality in general.

    masochist (if you're using PHP this answers itself)? Well then, this project just
    may be for you!

    Network, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction and much more in one library.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While I kid, I am far enough removed from the PHP world not to know whether
    this serves any particular pressing requirement; the 5K+ stars would suggest that
    it likely does! Beyond that, I'm always interested in seeing how machine learning
    ecosystems unfold in different programming language environments. Perhaps you
    are too, or more importantly you may actually have a use for what seems at preliminary
    glance to be a solid library for the PHP people out there.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this is not technically its own project, I find it important enough to
    highlight here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use Sequential Keras models (single-input only) as part of your Scikit-Learn
    workflow via the wrappers found at keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.py.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to how the underlying project was the most important to understand for
    skift (above), the important piece of this puzzle is having an understanding of
    implementing neural networks with Keras, itself a high-level API. Being able to
    integrate Keras with additional Scikit-learn functionality, and being able to
    use the familiar API and methods, is what these wrappers accomplish. Find the
    API on the official [Keras Github repository](https://github.com/keras-team/keras).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are already using Keras, there is a good chance this is not new to you.
    If you aren't, knowing that this integration is possible may be enough to have
    you take a look.
