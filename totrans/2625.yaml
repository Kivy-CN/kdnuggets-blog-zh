    where they are building internal PyData libraries that scale with Dask and RAPIDS.
    For this webinar, they’ll join Hugo Bowne-Anderson and Matthew Rocklin to discuss
    their journey to scale data science and machine learning in Python.

- en: In 2020, Capital One left data centers behind by completing a transition to
    the cloud, and they are now using the cloud with Dask to scale data science and
    machine learning. We’ll take a whirlwind tour through what this looked like and
    dive into several key specifics, such as how to deploy Dask and RAPIDS on AWS,
    the ins and outs of scaling your XGBoost workflows, and how Capital One leverages
    the scikit-learn API to scale with custom estimators.

- en: We’ll also hit some more cultural notes, such as how Capital One is building
    internal communities who are knowledgeable on the best practices of using these
    OSS tools and why it’s important for an enterprise company to contribute to this
    community today.
