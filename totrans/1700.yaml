- en: Docker is a tool that simplifies the installation process for software engineers.
    Coming from a statistics background I used to care very little about how to install
    software and would occasionally spend a few days trying to resolve system configuration
    issues. Enter the god-send Docker almighty.

- en: Think of Docker as a light virtual machine (I apologise to the Docker gurus
    for using that term). Generally someone writes a *Dockerfile* that builds a *Docker
    Image* which contains most of the tools and libraries that you need for a project.
    You can use this as a base and add any other dependencies that are required for
    your project. Its **underlying philosophy is that if it works on my machine it
    will work on yours**.

    was used in your machine are used on the other person’s machine. This makes sure
    that the analysis that you are generating will run on any other analysts machine.'

    get started on Docker. The **learning curve is minimal** (2 days work at most)
    and the gains are enormous.

    Docker truly powerful. It’s what **github is to git, a open platform to share
    your Docker images.** You can always construct a Docker image locally using `docker
    build ...` but it is always good to `push` this image to Dockerhub so that the
    next person simply has to `pull` for personal use.

    issues.

- en: Docker is one of the tools that as a software engineer (and now data scientists/
    analysts) should have in their repertoire (with almost the same regard and respect
    as git). For a long time statisticians and Data Scientists have ignored the software
    aspect of data analysis. Considering how simple and intuitive it has become to
    use Docker there really is no excuse for not making it part of your software development
    pipeline.

    should be noted that Docker is independent of python and R, and goes beyond containerising
    applications for specific programming languages.
