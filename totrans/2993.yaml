    the first time in several years the name of this highly anticipated Gartner **MQ
    for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms** report was essentially the same
    as last year. In 2018 the report was named "MQ for Data Science and Machine-Learning
    Platforms" (with an old-fashioned dash between Machine and Learning). In 2017
    it was "MQ for Data Science Platforms", and in 2016 "MQ for Advanced Analytics
    Platforms". Perhaps the emerging stability of the name reflects certain maturity
    in how the field of Data Science and Machine Learning is perceived. But there
    is no stability in the industry, with many changes among the vendors rankings,
    as you will see below.'

- en: The 2019 report evaluated 17 vendors (one more than in previous years) and placed
    them as always in 4 quadrants, based on completeness of vision (**vision** for
    short) and ability to execute (**ability** for short).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that Gartner included only vendors with commercially licensable products.
    Pure open-source platforms like Python and R, even though very popular with Data
    Scientists and Machine Learning professionals, were not included.

    image), with arrows connecting circles for the same firm. Arrows are colored green
    if the firm position improved significantly (further away from origin), red if
    the position became weaker. Green circles indicate 2 new firms (Google and DataRobot),
    while red X marks vendor dropped this year (Teradata).

    dropped on ability but still among the leaders, and TIBCO, which acquired several
    analytics firms recently, joined the leaders for the first time. Alteryx moved
    to Challengers quadrant and was joined by Dataiku who made a big improvement on
    ability axis. MathWorks improved significantly on vision and is closing on the
    Leaders.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RapidMiner remains a Leader by striking a good balance between ease of use and
    data science sophistication. Its platform's approachability is praised by citizen
    data scientists, while the richness of its core data science functionality, including
    its openness to open-source code and functionality, make it appealing to experienced
    data scientists, too.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a wealth of well-rounded functionality, KNIME maintains its reputation
    for being the market's "Swiss Army knife." Its for-free and open-source KNIME
    Analytics Platform covers 85% of critical capabilities, and KNIME's vision and
    roadmap are as good as, or better than, those of most of its competitors.
