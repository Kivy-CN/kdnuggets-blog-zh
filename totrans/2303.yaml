    stumbled upon the wrong website. There is also a good chance you know about Streamlit,
    but I suppose there is a much better chance you are unfamiliar with it than with
    machine learning.

    the essential Streamlit syntax for building machine learning apps quickly. And
    Streamlit isn't relegated to machine learning only. Indeed, there's likely no
    faster way to create a dashboard for your interactive data science project regardless
    of its intent, from data cleaning, to data exploration, to interacting with databases.

    Think of it this way: if you can do it with Python, you can do it with Streamlit.
    And since your Streamlit project is written entirely in Python, if you already
    code in the language should be able to pick up the library usage without much
    trouble, especially with a handy quick reference resource, like this.'
