  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting.
    Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data, and
    as a result, it performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization is a method to
    discourage large weights in the model by adding a penalty term to the loss function.
    This penalty term is a coefficient multiplied by the magnitude of the weights.
    By adding this term, the model is forced to have smaller weights, which helps
    to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. Two common
    types of regularization are L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds a
    penalty term that is proportional to the absolute value of the weights, and L2
    regularization adds a penalty term that is proportional to the square of the weights.

    curve?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Precision and recall are two important measures of a binary classifier's performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly predicted
    positive examples) out of all positive predictions made by the classifier. It
    is a measure of the classifier's ability to correctly identify positive examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) is the proportion of
    true positive predictions out of all actual positive examples. It is a measure
    of the classifier's ability to identify all positive examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation
    of a classifier's performance. It plots the true positive rate (recall) against
    the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different thresholds of the classifier.
    The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of the classifier's overall performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Precision and recall are closely related to the ROC curve. A classifier with
    high precision and high recall will have a high true positive rate and a low false
    positive rate, resulting in a ROC curve that hugs the top left corner of the plot.
    A classifier with low precision and low recall will have a low true positive rate
    and a high false positive rate, resulting in a ROC curve that is close to the
    diagonal line.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, it is often necessary to trade off precision and recall to achieve
    a balance between the two. This can be done by adjusting the threshold of the
    classifier, which controls the balance between true positives and false positives.
    A higher threshold will result in higher precision but lower recall, while a lower
    threshold will result in lower precision but higher recall.

    is really an improvement over not doing anything?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To prove that an improvement to an algorithm is real and not just due to chance,
    you can use statistical hypothesis testing. This involves formulating a null hypothesis
    and an alternative hypothesis, and then using a test statistic and a significance
    level to decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The null hypothesis is usually that the new algorithm is no better than the
    old one or the baseline algorithm, and the alternative hypothesis is that the
    new algorithm is better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common way to perform the hypothesis test is by using a two-tailed t-test.
    This compares the means of the performance metrics of the new and old algorithms
    and tests whether they are significantly different. Another way is to use a paired
    sample test, where the same dataset is used for both the new and old algorithm,
    and the results are compared.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the p-value (the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or
    more extreme than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true) is less
    than the significance level (usually 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected and
    it is concluded that the new algorithm is better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, to ensure that the improvement is not just due to chance, you
    can use techniques such as cross-validation, bootstrapping and repeat the test
    multiple times with different random subsets of the data to increase the robustness
    of the results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also important to compare the performance of the new algorithm to the state-of-the-art
    algorithms in the same field, if possible, to give a better perspective on the
    improvement.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of a problem or incident. It is a systematic process that involves identifying,
    analyzing, and resolving the problem at its source, rather than just treating
    the symptoms. The goal of RCA is to prevent similar problems from occurring in
    the future by identifying and addressing the root causes of the problem.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statistical power is the probability that a statistical test will correctly
    reject the null hypothesis (i.e., detect an effect) when the alternative hypothesis
    is true. In other words, it is the ability of a test to detect a difference or
    effect when one truly exists. It is usually expressed as a number between 0 and
    1 and is often denoted by the Greek letter beta (β). A higher statistical power
    means that the test is more likely to detect a true difference or effect, while
    a lower statistical power means that the test is more likely to fail to detect
    a true difference or effect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statistical power is influenced by several factors, including the sample size,
    the significance level (alpha), and the effect size. In general, increasing the
    sample size, decreasing the significance level, and increasing the effect size
    will increase the statistical power of a test.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to note that a high statistical power does not guarantee that
    a test will detect a true difference or effect but it is a good indication of
    the test's sensitivity to detect the effect, it is also important to understand
    that a high statistical power doesn't indicate high accuracy or reliability on
    the test.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Resampling methods are useful because they do not rely on assumptions about
    the underlying distribution of the population, they are more robust than traditional
    parametric methods. They allow researchers to make inferences about a population
    using only the information that is available in the sample, which is particularly
    useful when the population is difficult or expensive to measure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, resampling methods do have some limitations. One limitation is that
    the results obtained from these methods may be sensitive to the specific sample
    that is used, and so the results may not be generalizable to the population as
    a whole. Additionally, when the sample size is small, these methods may be less
    powerful than traditional parametric methods. Also, when the sample size is small,
    these methods may not be able to detect small differences or effects.

    Explain.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whether it is better to have too many false positives or too many false negatives
    depends on the specific context and the desired outcome of the analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: False positives, also known as type I errors, occur when a test or analysis
    incorrectly suggests that an effect or difference is present when it is actually
    not. In general, false positives are considered less desirable in situations where
    a negative outcome (e.g. a patient does not have a disease) has more severe consequences
    than a positive outcome (e.g. a patient has a disease but is not treated).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: False negatives, also known as type II errors, occur when a test or analysis
    incorrectly suggests that an effect or difference is not present when it is actually
    present. In general, false negatives are considered less desirable in situations
    where a positive outcome (e.g. a patient has a disease and is treated) has more
    severe consequences than a negative outcome (e.g. a patient does not have a disease
    but is not treated).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, in a medical context, a false negative may result in a patient
    not receiving treatment for a serious illness, while a false positive may lead
    to unnecessary treatment and its associated risks. On the other hand, in a security
    context, a false negative may result in an attacker getting through security,
    while a false positive may lead to inconvenience for a legitimate user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to set the threshold that balance these trade-offs, and this
    is where the concepts of sensitivity and specificity come in. Sensitivity is the
    proportion of true positives (correctly identified cases) among all the actual
    positive cases, while specificity is the proportion of true negatives (correctly
    identified non-cases) among all the actual negative cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, the choice between too many false positives or too many false negatives
    depends on the specific context, and the desired outcome, and it's important to
    consider both the costs and benefits of each type of error in order to make an
    informed decision.
