- en: Theano and Pylearn2 are both developed at University of Montreal with most developers
    in the LISA group led by Yoshua Bengio. Theano is a Python library, and you can
    also consider it as a mathematical expression compiler. It is good for making
    algorithms from scratch. [Here](http://www.picalike.com/blog/2015/01/12/the-portrait-of-a-machine-learning-priestess/)
    is an intuitive example of Theano training.

- en: If we want to use standard algorithms, we can write Pylearn2 plugins as Theano
    expressions, and Theano will optimize and stabilize the expressions. It includes
    all things needed for multilayer perceptron/RBM/Stacked Denoting Autoencoder/ConvNets. [Here](http://vdumoulin.github.io/articles/extending-pylearn2/)
    is a quick start tutorial to walk you through some basic ideas on Pylearn2.

    Jia and led by Evan Shelhamer. It is a fast and readable implementation of ConvNets
    in C++. As shown on its official page, Caffe can process over 60M images per day with
    a single NVIDIA K40 GPU with AlexNet. It can be used like a toolkit for image
    classification, while not for other deep learning application such as text or
    speech.

- en: Torch is written in Lua, and used at NYU, Facebook AI lab and Google DeepMind.
    It claims to provide a MATLAB-like environment for machine learning algorithms.
    Why did they choose Lua/LuaJIT instead of the more popular Python? They said in
    [Torch7 paper](http://data.neuflow.org/pubs/biglearn11.pdf) that “Lua is easily
    to be integrated with C so within a few hours’ work, any C or C++ library can
    become a Lua library.” With Lua written in pure ANSI C, it can be easily compiled
    for arbitrary targets.

    News about GPU especially Nvidia Cuda is all over the Internet. [Cuda-convnet](https://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/)/[CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN)
    supports all the mainstream softwares such as Caffe, Torch and Theano and is very
    easy to enable.

    environments, rather than as a research tool. As on its introduction, DL4J is
    a “Java-based, industry-focused, commercially supported, distributed deep-learning
    framework.”
