    achieving effective BI soon becomes an expensive and time-consuming task requiring
    significant computing resources and advanced software capabilities. As a result,
    organizations looking to reap the benefits of BI must invest in BI infrastructure,
    software, and maintenance. Additionally, it takes significant expertise to process,
    analyze, and interpret the data accurately. These costs become compounded when
    working with large data sets, which place higher demands on computing infrastructure.
    Because of the significant investment necessary to make BI useful for a business,
    it’s essential to understand the potential return on investment clearly.

    electronic health records (EHRs), lab results, and insurance claims. They aim
    to identify data patterns that can predict and prevent chronic diseases. By its
    very nature, the healthcare domain falls under the high-risk category and requires
    extensive experimentation to build robust models. The data insights can help the
    healthcare staff identify high-risk patients, find cost-effective treatments,
    and pinpoint patients most likely to be readmitted to the hospital. These valuable
    insights help the practitioner make informed decisions about patient care, treatment
    plans, and preventative measures.
