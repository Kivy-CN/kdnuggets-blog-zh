- en: When comes to machine learning, data is certainly the new oil. The processes
    for managing the lifecycle of datasets are some of the most challenging elements
    of large scale machine learning solutions. Data ingestion, indexing, search, annotation,
    discovery are some of the aspects required to maintain high quality datasets.
    The complexity of these challenges increase linearly with the size and number
    of the target datasets. While it is relatively easy to manage training datasets
    for a single machine learning model, scaling that process across thousands of
    dataset and hundreds of models can become nothing short of a nightmare. Some of
    the companies at the forefront of machine learning innovation such as LinkedIn,
    Uber, Netflix, Airbnb or Lyft have certainly experienced the magnitude of this
    challenge and they have built specific solutions to address it. Today, I would
    like to walk you through some of those solutions that can serve as an inspiration
    in your machine learning journey.

- en: High quality machine learning requires high quality datasets and those are not
    very easy to produce. As machine learning evolves, the need for tools and platforms
    that automate the lifecycle management of training and testing datasets is becoming
    increasingly important. Somewhat paradoxically, machine learning frameworks have
    evolved several orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding data management
    toolset. While today we have dozens high quality development frameworks that incorporate
    the latest research in deep learning disciplines, the platforms for managing the
    lifecycle of the datasets powering machine learning models are still in its infancy.
    To solve that challenge, fast growing technology companies like Uber or LinkedIn
    have been forced to build their own in-house data lifecycle management solutions
    to power different groups of machine learning models. Let’s take a look at how
    they did it.

    focus on LinkedIn’s Data Hub is to automate the collection, search and discovery
    of metadata related to datasets as well as other entities such as machine learning
    models, microservices, people, groups etc. Specifically, Data Hub was designed
    to achieve four specific goals:'

- en: To enable the aforementioned capabilities, Data Hub a state-of-the-art technology
    stack that includes several frameworks developed internally at LinkedIn. For instance,
    all metadata constructs stored in Data Hub are modeled using the [Pegasus](https://linkedin.github.io/rest.li/DATA-Data-Schema-and-Templates) data
    schema language which was incubated by LinkedIn years ago. Similarly, the APIs
    powering Data Hub are based on LinkedIn’s [Rest.li](https://engineering.linkedin.com/architecture/restli-restful-service-architecture-scale) architecture
    for highly scalable RESTful services. LinkedIn’s data storage technologies such
    as [Expresso](https://engineering.linkedin.com/espresso/introducing-espresso-linkedins-hot-new-distributed-document-store) or [Galene](https://engineering.linkedin.com/search/did-you-mean-galene) are
    also used to store the metadata representations in ways that can enable diverse
    use cases such as search or complex relationship navigations. To abstract those
    different types of storage, Data Hub uses a set of generic [Data Access Objects
    (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object), such as key-value DAO,
    query DAO, and search DAO. This allow to use Data Hub with different underlying
    storage technologies.
