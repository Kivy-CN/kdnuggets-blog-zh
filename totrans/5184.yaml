    get overwhelmed with all the information presented to you. There are hundreds
    of data science courses out there, and it is difficult to know where to start.

- en: When I decided to teach myself data science just a year ago, I remember feeling
    really lost because I didn’t know where to start. I saw advertisements for machine
    learning courses that promised to make me an expert in three days.  I read articles
    insisting it wasn’t possible to become a data scientist unless I had a Master's
    degree in mathematics and a Ph.D. in statistics. There was just too much information
    out there and so many conflicting opinions.

    and machine learning. I managed to break into the industry and land a data science
    job.

- en: Every day, at least one person asks me how I did this, how to learn data science
    from scratch, and land a job in the industry. I did some research and compiled
    a list of online courses you can take to learn data science. The syllabi of these
    courses are good and will give you a strong foundation in programming, SQL, and
    machine learning. I use almost all the concepts taught in these courses during
    my day job as a data scientist.

    I never thought of SQL as an important part of data science. However, when I did

    data manipulation with SQL.

    filtering data based on client requirements is something I do on a daily basis,
    so the content of this course is really important to understand.

    link multiple databases to each other. This is a very powerful technique. I deal
    with large databases on a daily basis and very often need to use joins to merge
    them together.
