    for **predictive modeling and analytics**. The company was founded in 2010 in
    Melbourne, Australia, and a year later, it moved to San Francisco after receiving
    funding from Silicon Valley. In 2017, it was acquired by Google. Read more about
    its history and future in [Interview with Anthony Goldbloom, CEO of Kaggle.](https://medium.com/implodinggradients/ama-with-anthony-goldbloom-ceo-of-kaggle-the-open-data-science-platform-6a2012538316)'

    the web, the downside to that is there is no benchmark, no way to compare your
    findings. There is the possibility of significant errors, and no one would know
    because there is no validation being performed. Kaggle competitions provide a
    platform for “checking your work.”

  prefs: []

    to understand the data and the evaluation metrics. Contrary to popular belief,
    there is still “dirty data” which requires further investigation. Digging deeper
    into misclassified items begets adjustments to the algorithm.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is true, doing one Kaggle competition does not qualify someone to be a data
    scientist. Neither does taking one class or attending one conference tutorial
    or analyzing one dataset or reading one book in data science. Working on competition(s)
    adds to your experience and augments your portfolio. It is a complement to your
    other projects, not the sole litmus test of one’s data science skillset.

    in a competition is one informative way to gauge your abilities and excitement.
    If you truly enjoy the process of Kaggle, it will point you more clearly in the
    right direction. If you prefer to spend your time doing something else, that is
    all right too; it is one way to find out.
