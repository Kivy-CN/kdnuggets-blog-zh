    system designed for data analytics and online analytical processing. This means
    several things:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's free and open-source software, so anyone can use and modify the code.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's embedded, meaning the DBMS (database management system) runs in the same
    process as the application that uses it. This makes it fast and simple to use.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's optimized for data analytics and OLAP (online analytical processing), not
    just transactional data like typical databases. This means the data is organized
    by columns instead of rows to optimize aggregation and analysis.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It supports standard SQL so you can run queries, aggregations, joins, and other
    SQL functions on the data.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It runs in-process, within the application itself rather than as a separate
    process. This eliminates the overhead of communicating between processes.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like SQLite, it's a simple, file-based database so there's no separate server
    installation required. You just include the library in your application.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, DuckDB provides an easy-to-use, embedded analytic database for applications
    that need fast and simple data analysis capabilities. It fills a niche for analytical
    processing where a full database server would be overkill.

    The database is designed for fast analytical queries which means it''s optimized
    for aggregations, joins, and complex queries on large datasets - the types of
    queries often used in analytics and reporting. Moreover:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's simple to install, deploy, and use. There is no server to configure - DuckDB
    runs embedded within your application. This makes it easy to integrate into different
    programming languages and environments.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite its simplicity, DuckDB has a rich feature set. It supports the full
    SQL standard, transactions, secondary indexes, and integrates well with popular
    data analysis programming languages like Python and R.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DuckDB is free for anyone to use and modify, which lowers the bar for developers
    and data analysts to adopt it.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DuckDB is well-tested and stable. It has an extensive test suite and is continuously
    integrated and tested on a variety of platforms to ensure stability.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DuckDB offers comparable performance to specialized OLAP databases while being
    easier to deploy. This makes it suitable for both analytical queries on small
    to medium datasets as well as large enterprise datasets.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, DuckDB combines the simplicity and ease of use of SQLite with the
    analytical performance of specialized columnar databases. All of these factors
    - performance, simplicity, features, and open source license - contribute to DuckDB's
    growing popularity among developers and data analysts.

    pandas into a relation. DuckDB provides a relational API that allows users to
    link query operations together. The queries are lazily evaluated, which enables
    DuckDB to optimize their execution.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, DuckDB operates on an in-memory database. This means that any tables
    created are stored in memory and not persisted to disk. However, by using the
    `.connect()` method, a connection can be made to a persistent database file on
    disk. Any data written to that database connection will then be saved to the disk
    file and reloaded when reconnecting to the same file.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why do I like DuckDB? It is fast and simple to learn and manage. I believe simplicity
    is the main reason DuckDB has become widely used in the data science community.
    DuckDB provides an intuitive SQL interface that is easy for data analysts and
    scientists to pick up. Installation is straightforward, and the database files
    are light and manageable. All of these make DuckDB a joy to use.
