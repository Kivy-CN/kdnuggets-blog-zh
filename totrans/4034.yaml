- en: Sentiment analysis is a method, used to predict feelings, like digital psychologists.
    With this, psychologist you created, the destiny of the text you’ll analyze will
    be in your hands. You can do it like the famous psychologist Freud, or you can
    just be there like a psychologist, charging 10 dollars per session.

    analysis does the same things on text, like reviews, comments, or tweets, as we
    will do in the next section. To do that, let’s start doing a case study on the
    ready dataset.
