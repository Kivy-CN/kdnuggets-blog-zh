- en: Data teams are increasingly working like software engineering teams, embracing
    engineering and development tools to manage their work. These range from version
    control systems like Github, to adopting agile practices such as Kanban and Scrum,
    and include ceremonies like daily standup, sprint commitments and sprint demos.
    Purpose-built solutions (like dbt for data modeling, testing and integration)
    have come to market, supporting the software engineering mindset. These solutions
    power large, distributed data teams to do their best work.

    there is still a lot of room for innovation.
  prefs: []

- en: Even the most forward-thinking data-driven organizations still rely on standard
    collaboration tools and practices (e.g. Slack, email or regularly scheduled meetings)
    to manage communication between their data teams and business stakeholders. After
    all, why not? Shouldn’t the data team and its workflows resemble other functions
    in the organization? This argument, and behavior, works when the interactions
    are relatively generic in nature. But in situations where team dynamics are more
    complex (and data is more central to every important conversation and decision),
    this reliance on generic solutions is insufficient.

- en: As data becomes more central to business operations, data team members often
    need to wear multiple hats.  In some cases, they need to function as product managers
    by understanding business users' needs, so they can evolve the data platform. 
    In other instances, they are required to handle ad hoc requests in a support capacity. 
    In yet other situations, they need to onboard new users and help them to engage
    with the data assets available to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generic collaboration tooling and traditional approaches to managing work quickly
    break down in these scenarios. Product teams and support teams have purpose-built
    tooling to manage their work.  Don’t data teams also need a solution to best manage
    stakeholder requests? Or tools for managing their support documentation, or training
    end users? The best data teams often find themselves struggling with this part
    of their workflow, and end up adopting solutions built for others (in this instance,
    product and support teams).

    to find the right way to work with business stakeholders without creating confusion

- en: If you investigate the collaboration problems between data teams and others,
    you are bound to find information asymmetries between builders and consumers of
    data assets.  On the one hand, you have data builders with deep knowledge about
    the underlying data, how to manipulate and analyze it, and how to contextualize
    it within a larger body of data assets. On the other hand, you have data consumers,
    who are typically domain experts with rich knowledge about the business itself,
    which can be critical to providing broader context, understanding the data, and
    evolving the data platform.

    managing a distributed team of 15 salespeople spread out across the southeast.
    On the second day of her new job, she is forwarded an email from a colleague with
    several links to various resources: a spreadsheet with pipeline information, various
    reports in Salesforce, and a handful of dashboards about individual performance
    in the company BI solution. After spending a few minutes looking at the data,
    she realizes that she has no idea what she is really looking at, and what it means.
    She sends a message to her sales ops manager asking for help, who loops in their
    partner on the data team who built most of those resources. The data analyst reads
    the email, sighs, and then spends the next hour writing out a reply. They create
    a ticket on their JIRA board to “re-evaluate documentation.”'

    asymmetries between builders and consumers, which leave everyone frustrated and
    unhappy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tragically, the folks who are most often impacted by these dynamics are junior
    employees or middle management on the front lines, because they typically have
    less power in the organization and the least context for understanding the decisions
    being made around the data. Without intensive training, these employees are vulnerable
    to types of communication problems that result from information asymmetries. They
    are also prone to fall victim to “squeaky wheel syndrome,” where the executives
    and senior leadership team members’ voices are naturally heard the loudest by
    data teams (and therefore their requests and needs are prioritized over those
    of others.)

- en: In order to get a better return on investment from the massive investments made
    in data tooling and teams, we need to attack these information asymmetries at
    the heart of our problems. Getting to zero is perhaps an aspirational goal, but
    data teams should continually strive to close this gap through practices, partnerships
    and tooling. Doing so will remove friction, increase transparency and trust, and
    allow everyone to get more out of the company’s data offerings.

    This includes not only reporting models, but also data team roles and functions.
    We are already starting to see more job postings for roles like “data product
    manager” or “data scrum master.” These new functions will help data teams manage
    collaboration challenges which, at the end of the day, are usually about people
    and processes versus underlying technology problems.'

    in some cases entire pods – are aligned to specific business units. This will
    allow alignment of longer term data initiatives to immediate business needs, foster
    knowledge sharing, as well as closer, collaborative relationships between analysts
    and those who they support day to day.'
