- en: So yesterday someone told me you can build a (deep) neural network in 15 minutes
    in Keras. Of course, I didn’t believe that at all. Last time I tried (maybe 2
    years ago?) it was still quite some work, involving comprehensive knowledge of
    programming and math. That was some dead serious craftmanship.

    and I must say it seemed easy enough. But surely I would find some difficulties
    when I would try it out, right? Getting used to these packages can take months
    sometimes.

    to refactor some code in our own internal package for converting data to tabular
    form. This was frustrating me for a while anyway. In the end, that and answering
    my e-mails and questions took most of my morning. After finishing that, I could
    easily export some of my data to csv files and read it in with Pandas, convert
    it to Numpy Arrays, and we’re ready to go.

    model building. Keras and Tensorflow installed in no time, super easy since the
    last time I tried to install Tensorflow on a Windows laptop. Then I practically
    copy-pasted the code from the Keras Documentation. I’m not even going to start
    a github repository, this is all I did:'

    it, fitting the data, and doing the prediction. All in less than 10 lines of code.
    I’m not doing any hyperparameter optimization or smart layer architecture today.
    But I must say; pfew, that was easy!

    against some benchmarks. Don’t tell my managers I’m spending my time on this though!
    (Just kidding, they encourage some exploring and learning.) So I’m loading the
    data back into my own testing framework, and running a few other algorithms. Here
    are the results for my final performance metrics.

- en: It’s embarrassingly good for less than an hour of model building. The super
    secret model we’ve been working on for 1.5 years still outperforms it (thankfully).
    On top of that, the big downside of any Neural Network of course is that it’s
    a complete black box as to what it actually learned. While our secret model is
    using pattern recognition that we can diagnose later on as humans.

    advise to start with Keras. Hitting the ground running is a lot of fun, and you
    can learn and finetune the details later on.
