- en: Qubits, short for quantum bits, are the standard units of information used in
    quantum computing, similar to how traditional computing uses binary bits. Qubits
    use a principle known as superposition so that they can be in multiple states
    at one time. Binary bits can only be 0 or 1, whereas Qubits can be 0 or 1, just
    a part of 0 or 1, or both 0 and 1.

- en: While binary bits are typically silicon-based microchips, qubits can consist
    of photons, trapped ions, and atoms or quasiparticles, both real and artificial.
    Because of this, most quantum computers require extremely sophisticated cooling
    equipment to work at very cold temperatures.

    states](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/superposition-and-entanglement/),
    and these particles can change and move while the quantum computer observes and
    measures them individually. A good analogy to explain superposition is the various
    moments a coin is in the air when it is tossed.

    different outcomes. Instead of traditional, sequential processing, quantum computing
    can run a huge number of parallel computations at once thanks to superposition.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quantum particles can correlate with each other in terms of their measurements,
    creating a network known as entanglement. During this engagement, the measurement
    of one qubit can be used in calculations that are made by other qubits. As a result,
    quantum computing can solve extremely complex problems and process vast amounts
    of data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the likelihood of qubits becoming unusable. Quantum computers have measures in
    place to try to reduce this interference to ensure the results are as accurate
    as possible. The more quantum interference, the less accurate any outcomes are.
