    [2018 data science ecosystem](/2018/06/ecosystem-data-science-python-victory.html)),
    we examine which tools were part of the same answer - the skillset of the user.
    We note that this does not necessarily mean that all tools were used together
    on each project, but having knowledge and skills to used both tools X and Y makes
    it more likely that both X and Y were used together on some projects. The results
    we see are consistent with this assumption.

    as last year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, we selected the tools with at least 20% of the vote. There were 11 such
    tools - exactly the same list of 11 tools as last year, although the order has
    changed a little. Keras moved up from n. 10 to n. 8, and Anaconda moved up from
    n. 6 to n. 5\. Tableau and SQL moved down a little.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    n. 11 (Apache Spark, with 21%) and n. 12 (Microsoft Power BI, 13%).

    with Tensorflow and Keras, until we arrived to the figure 1 below. We made the
    patterns easier to see by showing only associations with abs(Lift1) > 15%.

    X usage with R. To visualize how close is each tool to Python or R, we used a
    very simple measure **Bias_Py_R(X) = with_Py(X) - with_R(X)**, which is positive
    if tool is more used with Python and negative if it is more used with R.

- en: In Fig. 2, we charted the bias of most popular tools with at least 90 votes,
    and as we can see, almost every tool is biased towards Python. The only 3 exceptions
    are R (obviously), Microsoft SQL Server, and SAS Base (which is exactly zero bias).
    For comparison, in a [similar 2017 analysis](/2017/06/ecosystem-data-science-machine-learning-software.html)
    there were 10 tools biased towards R and 3 R-biased tools in 2018.

    used for data analysis and visualization, and it still has about 50% share. However,
    going forward, we expect more development and energy around Python ecosystem.
