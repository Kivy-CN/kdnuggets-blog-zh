    have to look too far back to find the answer to that question. We deal with a
    multitude of documents on a daily basis in our lives and an overwhelmingly large
    number of those are indeed PDF documents. It is fair to claim that a lot of these
    documents are tediously repetitive and agonizingly painful to formulate. It is
    about time we consider leveraging the power of automation with Python to mechanize
    the tedious so that we may reallocate our precious time to more pressing tasks
    in our lives.

    to do here should be trivial enough that our inner unsavvy laymen can tackle in
    short order. After reading this tutorial you will learn how to automatically generate
    PDF documents with your own data, charts and images all bundled together with
    a dazzling look and structure.

    sets the structure for the rest of our page. For this tutorial I used Microsoft
    PowerPoint to render the formatting for my background image. I simply used text
    boxes and other visuals to create the desired format and once I was done I grouped
    everything together by selecting all the elements and hitting Ctrl-G. Finally
    I saved the grouped elements as a PNG image by right clicking on them and selecting
    ‘save as picture’.

    you’ve learnt how to create PDF documents, insert text and images into them and
    you’ve also learnt how to generate and embed charts and figures. But you are by
    no means limited to just that, in fact you can extend these techniques to include
    other visuals with multiple page documents too. The sky is truly the limit.
