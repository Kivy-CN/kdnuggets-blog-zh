    estimated that by 2025, the amount of data generated is to reach 163 zettabytes;
    ten times the amount of data produces in 2017\. So you can imagine the demand
    for Data Scientists going through the roof. In 2012, LinkedIn released that there
    was a 650% growth in Data Scientists. The career is in the top-ranked best jobs
    listing and highest-paying jobs.'

    with its challenges. You would imagine a job that is in such high demand, there
    will be fewer challenges and problems as they are critical within organisations.
    However, according to [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/49e81ebe-cbc3-11e7-8536-d321d0d897a3),
    many companies seem to be failing to create jobs that benefit the drastic spark
    in data experts. Many of the data experts are struggling to move up the ladder
    or meet their career aspirations. According to a Stack Overflow survey, [13.2%](https://www.ft.com/content/49e81ebe-cbc3-11e7-8536-d321d0d897a3)
    of the data scientists are looking for a new job, as they are not satisfied in
    their current role.

    spend nearly 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/?sh=1f2053786f63).
    The title of this article is called ‘Most Time-Consuming, Least Enjoyable Data
    Science Task‘, so you can imagine why 13.2% of Data Scientists are looking for
    new jobs. If most of your time is spent improving the quality of data, making
    it accurate and consistent before doing any analysis on it; it can become very
    draining, mundane, and very time-consuming.

    of your Data Scientists, adopting emerging AI-enabled data science technologies
    such as Augmented Analytics. Augmented Analytics automates manual data cleansing
    and preparation tasks, allowing data scientists to be more productive and spend
    time with other tasks such as analysis that they prefer to do and enjoy.

    security and advanced machine learning-enabled security platforms to protect their
    data. Also ensuring that the organisation is practicing data protection rules
    and regulations to avoid audits and fines; which gives the organisation a bad

    Scientists have to understand the problem that needs to be solved. They are the
    scientists of data, so they will be the ones reconstructing it to find the solution;
    so it is imperative they have a good understanding of the issue.

    do everything. As a Data Scientist, you are required to collect and clean data,
    build models and analyse the data. As mentioned above, 80% of Data Scientists'
    time is spent on cleaning and preparing the data, so you can imagine how much
    effort is put in trying to achieve building models and analysing the data after.

    ineffectively. They will lose motivation, they will feel overwhelmed by the workload,
    and probably want to quit.  Other colleagues need to understand each Data Scientists'
    role, strengths, and weaknesses. Also, this misinterpretation that Data Scientists
    are so clever, they can do everything and they are capable to do anything assigned.

    in the market. With the rapid increase in Data Scientists, to be successful in
    the role, you will not only need to have exceptional technical skills, you will
    also need non-technical skills such as understanding the organisations requirement,
    communicating with stakeholders in a way to assure them why the analysis produced
    is of use and will benefit the company.
