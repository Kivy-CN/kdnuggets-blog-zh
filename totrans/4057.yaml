- en: Programs aren't simply a sequence of commands each executing a single time,
    one after another, from the first line to the last. Programming requires the ability
    to loop over data, make decisions based on input, and run a command until a particular
    goal is reached, along with many other execution strategies.

- en: The manner in which we control the execution of commands within a program is
    referred to as **flow control**. Since controlling the flow of code execution
    can have a considerable programmatic effect, computational algorithms are the
    combination of commands and the order in which they are executed. Without knowing
    how to control how your code executes, you won't accomplish much of anything as
    a programmer.

- en: The state of flow control has come a long way since the days of `goto`. There
    are numerous common execution patterns that are available in the majority of modern
    programming languages, though their syntax differs from language to language.
    Python has its own, generally quite readable, set of flow controls, and that's
    what our latest cheat sheet focuses on.

- en: Flow control is one one of the major aspects of programming, and as such every
    aspiring programmer needs to master it. Paradoxically, the exact syntax for some
    of these commonly-used commands and structures often need to be checked up on
    by programmers, even as they progress further into their careers. This cheat sheet
    both provides the information you need to quickly learn these strategies, along
    with a reference to use moving forward.
