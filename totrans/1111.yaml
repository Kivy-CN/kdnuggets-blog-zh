- en: Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects
    in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those
    in other groups. In most cases, clustering calls for knowing the distances between
    objects, which normally takes the form of a distance matrix. However, the function
    of distance is often unknown, or clustering rules cannot be defined. Consequently,
    it makes more sense to describe the process in the labeling instructions and utilize
    crowdsourcing to cluster the data. Alas, no ready pipeline currently exists for
    this purpose, while most papers on the subject are limited to theory. We wanted
    to see if we could come up with a more practical solution. This is what we ended
    up with.

    where all of the labeled data is broken down into two clusters. To do this, we
    needed to compare the two subsets of objects against each other twice and then
    aggregate the data using a specialized algorithm. Having said that, two-cluster
    tasks are quite rare. To top it off, doing a paired subset comparison that comprises
    all of the objects is very expensive. Lastly, the algorithm gives out a single
    set with a complement to it, which isn’t proper clustering, technically speaking.
    But we had to start somewhere nonetheless.

    But since we wanted a more efficient solution, we continued to look for viable
    alternatives.'

    the authors suggest an approach that allows for any number of image clusters.
    It works in the following way: we start with a page that contains images and a
    color palette. The performer selects a color and labels similar-looking images
    with it. Then the person selects a different color and groups together a different
    subset of images according to another shared characteristic. This goes on until
    all of the images have been color-labeled.'

    pages on which each image is displayed. This number has to be chosen for each
    case, or it has to be defined in terms of its relation to the dataset size. The
    labeled data gets aggregated with a probabilistic model provided in the article,
    and the algorithm subsequently produces the clusters. What’s interesting is that
    this approach doesn’t call for known distances between the objects.

    [Toloka tutorial](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3318464.3383127) consisting
    of 100 images with people wearing clothes. In order to skip what Machine Learning
    has been trained to do already, we asked the crowd performers to group the objects
    by style regardless of the color. The logic behind it was that most of us can
    tell one fashion style of clothes from another, even if we can’t always verbalize
    the defining feature of any particular style. The instructions contained certain
    features and details that could be taken into account to help the performers,
    for example, the high heel.

    were men’s shoes, women’s boots, sports shoes, and four others. We were glad to
    see that women’s shoes and women’s sandals formed two separate clusters. Sample
    images from each cluster can be seen below.

    images of dresses from the [Feidegger](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/feidegger)
    dataset and again decided to cluster them by style. However, unlike shoes, dresses
    tend to contain more features, which is why we needed to come up with a precise
    but concise set of instructions for the crowd performers completing this assignment.
  prefs: []

    special cases to the performers since we didn’t actually know the structure of
    this dataset. We approached our colleagues from the [Crowd Solutions Architect
    (CSA)](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/06/data-careers-crowd-solutions-architect.html)
    team at [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/) with this dilemma. They helped us configure
    quality control, create a practice pool with a training program, and write up
    appropriate instructions. As a result, the task was made clear to the performers,
    which, in turn, boosted the labeling quality.
  prefs: []

- en: The instructions did not contain any worst-case scenarios or all of the grouping
    criteria. The performers were advised to focus on pinpointing the style of a dress,
    level of detail (for example, the size of the neckline but not its shape), and
    identify images with the overall similar vs. different looking dresses. We wanted
    to explain what logic could be used to compare the dresses, outline a basic approach
    to clustering, but not list any specific characteristics for the performers to
    memorize and cling to during the actual labeling.

    with a two-dress comparison and eventually going all the way up to eight dresses.
    The key rules were explained en-route to the final exam that consisted of multiple

    us how many object comparisons were needed for successful aggregation. We ended
    up with 12 easily interpretable clusters: among them were fluffy sleeveless dresses,
    long dresses with sleeves, knitted dresses, and so on. The picture below shows
    some of the objects from each cluster we acquired.'

- en: As a result of these efforts, we were able to confirm that clustering through
    crowdsourcing is indeed possible and works impressively well. The quality we obtained
    met our expectations, and we came up with a replicable pipeline. Moreover, we
    found a way to make the instructions clear to the performers and created a suitable
    interface for the task. Crucially, all this was possible without the paired comparison
    we started with. The labeling did not take a long time and was cheaper than previously
    anticipated.

    the crowdsourced-based evaluation approach by [Chang et al. (NIPS '11)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2009/file/f92586a25bb3145facd64ab20fd554ff-Paper.pdf).
    They suggest using intruders, i.e., adding a deliberately incorrect object to
    the cluster and asking performers to find it. The more often performers choose
    this obviously incorrect object and not some other object in the cluster, the
    higher we consider the quality.
