    a machine interacts with our environment and us in the near future. It is still
    a young field (originated from 1960s) but the technology starts to work at the
    first time in history with recent advances in machine learning. Applications like
    self-driving cars, robotics, VR/AR have motivated people to enter the field and
    apply the technology to much broader areas. It has become one of the most [active](https://medium.com/iotforall/visual-data-and-the-killer-app-for-ai-5cfaf71db66a) subfields
    of Artificial Intelligence.

    or business use cases. To work with computer vision, you need three things: data,
    algorithm and computation. Giant tech companies like Google and Amazon has made
    heavy computation possible for everyone with their cloud platform offering. The
    research community (e.g. arXiv) and open source community (e.g. Github) bring
    us better algorithms on paper and easy-to-use code in practice. It has never been
    a better time to study this complex subject which used to require Ph.D level experience.
    But there is one problem left — Data. More specifically, visual data which comes
    with high quality annotations. Building a good dataset requires a lot of thinking
    in terms of size, content balance, visual variations to help the trained model
    generalize well to unseen cases. Labeling a large scale dataset can be very expensive
    and slow, making it still a barrier for individuals or small companies with limited
    budget to experiment with new ideas.'

- en: The answer to the problem is open datasets. Instead of building your own dataset,
    there already exists a rich collection of computer vision datasets contributed
    by academic researchers, hobbyists and companies. These datasets include diverse
    topics from recognizing objects to reconstructing a 3D room, from finding a person
    in a video to identifying a shirt in a photo. They generally come with good quality
    labels annotated manually. In recent years, new datasets even include pretrained
    deep learning models that you can directly try out without training one by yourself.
    However, to discover these datasets is not that easy. They are usually hosted
    separately on the creator’s website and it’s hard to compare different ones to
    choose the best one for a specific task. For newcomers, it’s also hard to come
    up with the right keywords to put in Google.

- en: That’s why we built [**VisualData**](http://www.visualdata.io/), a search engine
    for computer vision datasets. Each dataset is manually curated at this point,
    tagged with relevant topics for filtering and you can type keywords in the search
    bar which will be matched to the title and description of the dataset to easily
    find the best one to use. They are sorted according to published date so the most
    recent addition gets surfaced. The detail view shows the full description of a
    dataset and links to open source code/models. Other useful information will be
    added incrementally in the future, e.g. articles/tutorials about the dataset,
    difficulty to work with etc. Some example screenshots of the site are illustrated
    below.

    interested in computer vision easily explore existing data to do their experiments
    faster. It is still in an early form, and there are some cool ideas to be added
    for future versions. We hope to hear how it can be more useful to you.
