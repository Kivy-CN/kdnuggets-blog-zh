    preparation and exploration, data representation and transformation, data visualization
    and presentation, predictive analytics, and machine learning, etc. For beginners,
    it’s only natural to raise the following question: **What skills do I need to
    become a data scientist?**

    data scientists. These skills could be grouped into 2 categories, namely, **technological
    skills** (Math & Statistics, Coding Skills, Data Wrangling & Preprocessing Skills,
    Data Visualization Skills, Machine Learning Skills, and Real World Project Skills)
    and** soft skills** (Communication Skills, Lifelong Learning Skills, Team Player
    Skills, and Ethical Skills).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data is key for any analysis in data science, be it inferential analysis, predictive
    analysis, or prescriptive analysis. The predictive power of a model depends on
    the quality of the data that was used in building the model. Data comes in different
    forms, such as text, table, image, voice, or video. Most often, data that is used
    for analysis has to be mined, processed, and transformed to render it to a form
    suitable for further analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'i) **Data Wrangling**: The process of data wrangling is a critical step for
    any data scientist. Very rarely is data easily accessible in a data science project
    for analysis. It’s more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted
    from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. Knowing how to wrangle and
    clean data will enable you to derive critical insights from your data that would
    otherwise be hidden.'
