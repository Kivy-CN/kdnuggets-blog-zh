    roles in the tech industry, such as software engineering and product management.
    Initially, DS interviews had a limited coding component, including only SQL or
    applied data manipulation sessions using Python or R. In recent years, however,
    DS interviews have shown an increased emphasis on computer science (CS) fundamentals
    (data structures, algorithms, and programming best practices).
  prefs: []

    more CS in interviews can be daunting. In this post, we hope to increase your
    understanding of the coding interview and teach you how to prepare for it. We
    will categorize different coding questions and provide tips to crack them so that
    you can have a stellar interview. You can reach out to us [here](https://data-interview-questions.web.app/) if

    refer to any technical session that involves coding in any programming language
    other than a query language like SQL. In today’s market, you can expect a coding
    interview with just about any data science job.

    emphasis, there is a lower likelihood of encountering coding questions. Interviews
    for these roles do not often go beyond evaluating SQL proficiency, but general
    programming may still be tested from time to time. Candidates who do not possess
    a basic level of coding knowledge can be easily caught off guard during the interview
    and may fail to move forward in the process. Do not let that be you! Make sure
    you are prepared. You can start your preparation by learning what to expect with

    or both. There could even be multiple rounds of coding interviews during the onsite
    portion, depending on the coding proficiency expected. In general, you should
    expect coding interviews in at least one stage of an overall DS interview loop.

    online integrated development environments (IDEs) such as CoderPad, HackerRank,
    and CodeSignal. During onsite sessions, either an online IDE or a whiteboard can
    be used. In the current remote interview environment, the former is used by default.
