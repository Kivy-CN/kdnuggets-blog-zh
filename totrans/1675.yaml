    business) seems to show a tendency of applying somewhat complex and rather computationally
    expensive algorithms to applications that would have been easily accommodated
    in the past by much simpler (hence faster) and much more interpretable (hence
    of greater business value) techniques. In the series of texts to come I will try
    to introduce the power and beauty of descriptive statistics as an approach for
    quantitatively describing the nature of data and creating solid foundations for
    any subsequent data investigations. In this post I will introduce one of the weapons
    of the mighty dwarf – the “kurtosis”.

    data. Typically, one may turn into the classic means of outlier analysis like
    the DBSCAN-based approaches or LOF. Nothing wrong with these, they may perfectly
    well point towards the directions where the outliers may be present. However,
    these techniques may require substantial computational resources to complete the
    task on high volumes of data in reasonably acceptable amount of time. A much faster
    alternative may come from considering the given case as a time series analysis
    problem. Such data coming from a system operating in ‘healthy’ conditions would
    have a typical, acceptable amplitude distribution and, in such scenario, any deviation
    from the expected shape may be considered a potential threat, worth detecting.

    distribution of a signal. What does it mean? We are all pretty well accustomed
    to the bell-shape of the Gaussian distribution. Should a Gaussian signal accumulate
    some additional samples of significantly greater amplitudes (impulses), its distribution
    will suffer from widening the its tails. As a result, the entire distribution
    would look more sharp i.e., more peaked compared to the pure Gaussian signal.
    I will present this concept in the following case study.

- en: '**Note:** Some implementations of kurtosis use the raw output of the Eq. 1,
    but often a value of 3 is subtracted from the kurtosis value, so that the value
    of kurtosis for the Gaussian signal is around 0\. Such implementation is often
    referred to as the “excess kurtosis”. The later version is used in SciPy by default.
    Since I’m in favour of the classic “output of 3 for the Gaussian”, I am setting
    the “fisher” parameter of the kurtosis function to False.'

    lies in the normalization of the output, meaning that regardless of the absolute
    amplitude of the signal i.e., the number of sold goods, the kurtosis value will
    remain around the expected 3 for a Gaussian signal: if we multiply the amplitude
    of our signal 100 times, the kurtosis is still within the expected range:'

    drop on day 201 (Figure 2).'

    proportional to the amplitude of the impulses which constitutes another very helpful

    of the distribution. Compare histograms of ‘sales’ and ‘sales_spike’ shown in
    Figure 3 and 4 respectively. Even though the two histograms are being generated
    from virtually identical signals, apart from the ‘sales_spike’ having the two
    impulses, the amplitude distributions look very different and one of them clearly
    appears as more sharp (the one with the higher kurtosis value) compared to the
    other.

    it is normalized for differences in amplitudes of the data and is very fast to
