    don’t know,  GitHub is a code-hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
    Who uses GitHub? You will see individual professionals, companies, university
    and bootcamp students, teachers, and beyond using the platform for collaborating
    and tracking code.

    these reasons: it is easy to use, supports both public and private repositories,
    and it''s free on small scale projects. GitHub also has a [community](https://github.com/community)
    which helps to support all users on GitHub with questions, problems and their
    overall educational journey. Over the years, people have come to view GitHub differently,
    with some seeing it primarily for collaboration, others see it as a learning portal
    or go there to get inspiration.'
