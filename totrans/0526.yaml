- en: I started my data science journey by completing the IBM Data Science Professional
    Certificate on Coursera. It took me almost two years to land a data scientist
    job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It took me longer than I anticipated to find a job in this field. After spending
    so much time looking for a job, I think I know the reasons that extended my journey
    and I would like to share them with you.

- en: The first and foremost problem was to show I actually know stuff. Without prior
    job experiences, it is hard to demonstrate your skills. In most cases, I could
    not even pass the first step and get a technical interview. I felt like HR professionals
    did not take my resume into consideration due to a lack of job experience in the
    field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I got very few technical interviews, and I mostly did well. It made me happy
    and motivated not to fail technical interviews. It was a good sign that shows
    I was on the right track and improving my knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, I had a hard time reaching the technical interviews. An efficient solution
    to this problem is obviously networking. If you know or meet people who work in
    the field, the chance of getting at least a technical interview substantially
    increases.

    alternative is to complete projects. I do not mean the ones you can do in a day
    or two.
  prefs: []

- en: You need to frame a problem and design your approach that aims to solve the
    problem using data. Then, you implement your approach. Your project does not have
    to accomplish the task or solve the problem. However, how you think analytically,
    approach a problem, and use data as a solution matter a lot. I know it is very
    difficult to do such a project, but you should at least try.

- en: Another problem for me was not having enough time. I had to keep my job (not
    related to data science by any means) during the two years I studied data science.
    So I had only evenings and weekends to study.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is not just about having time. You need to have a fresh mind to study and
    actually learn new concepts and skills. If you plan to work while you learn data
    science, keep in mind that it is not going to be easy.
  prefs: []

- en: The whole process becomes relatively easier if you can dedicate yourself to
    learning data science. You will probably reach your goal faster if you can afford
    to quit your job. However, it is not an option for some people, including myself.

- en: Software or programming is a fundamental skill for data science. It is not enough
    to have a comprehensive understanding of statistics, machine learning models,
    or a great analytical mind. You need to be able to use the tools and software
    packages to implement your solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I did not have any prior programming experience. I even had to take the “Introduction
    to C++” class twice to pass. It is not because it was very difficult. I just did
    not have an interest in programming. I studied electrical engineering in college,
    and I did not think that I would ever need programming skills. I was clearly wrong.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It took me a while to obtain programming skills. I’m not talking about just
    Pandas and Scikit-learn. You will need a lot more than that. I think SQL is a
    must. You also need to be really good at a programming language, preferably Python
    or R. Git, Spark (or PySpark), Airflow, Cloud Computing, Docker are some of the
    other tools you need to get familiar with.
  prefs: []

    to get things going in terms of software tools and packages.

- en: The number of data scientist jobs was limited in where I live. This can be considered
    an environmental issue, but it definitely has an impact. When I first started
    learning data science, the number of job openings was not many. In the past two
    years, though, the number of companies that look for data scientists has greatly
    increased. Thus, just considering the number of open positions, my chance of getting
    a job is higher than it was two years ago.

- en: Although it took me two years to start working as a data scientist, I’m more
    than glad that I decided to make a career change to become a data scientist. My
    motivation and enthusiasm have increased since I started working as a data scientist.

- en: To work in a production environment with real-life data is something we cannot
    achieve with certificates, courses, or tutorials. It has been a long and exhaustive
    journey for me, but it is definitely worth it.
