- en: A month into 2024 and I’ve never seen my LinkedIn profile so busy with ‘Open
    to Work’ banners and posts. 2023 was already tough, with a lot of companies announcing
    layoffs, and what’s even sadder is that the layoffs were quite brutal. Some were
    told ‘You’re fired, see you later’, and others weren’t even paid what they were
    owed - it was all a mess.

  zh: 进入2024年一个月，我从未见过我的LinkedIn主页上如此多的“开放工作”标语和帖子。2023年已经很艰难，很多公司宣布裁员，更糟的是，这些裁员相当残酷。有些人被告知“你被解雇了，再见”，而其他人甚至没有拿到应得的工资——一团糟。

- en: As you can see from the visualization, the majority of layoffs were within HR
    and Talent Resourcing - which is no shock as at one point they were very much
    needed for the hiring spree. The second majority was software engineers, then
    marketing, and so on.

  zh: 从可视化图表中可以看出，大多数裁员发生在HR和人才资源部门——这并不令人惊讶，因为在某一时刻，这些部门曾因招聘热潮而极其重要。其次是软件工程师，其次是市场营销部门，依此类推。
- en: The data also showed that between 2022-2023, 56% of layoffs were women, 48%

- en: If we go back to 365datascience’s findings, the majority of layoffs were within
    HR and Talent Resourcing. Some of the day-to-day tasks within these sectors have
    been heavily replaced with automation. Companies are integrating a lot of tools
    and software that are being used to handle manual tasks done within HR. Is this
    the reason why HR and Talent Resourcing was at the top of the list?
  id: totrans-30

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果我们回顾365数据科学的发现，大多数裁员发生在HR和人才资源部门。这些部门的许多日常任务已经被自动化技术大幅替代。公司正在整合许多工具和软件，用于处理HR部门的手动任务。这是否是HR和人才资源部门在名单上排名靠前的原因？

  zh: 但这对其他部门意味着什么呢？为什么他们会被裁员？
- en: Personally, I believe the other sectors are dealing with the aftermath of the
    tech hiring spree during the pandemic and as we are going through the possibilities
    of a recession, companies are struggling to keep financially afloat. This means
    all those who were hired during the tech hiring spree or are too expensive to
    keep have to be let go.

  zh: 个人认为，其他部门正在处理疫情期间科技招聘热潮的后遗症，而我们正经历经济衰退的可能性，公司在努力维持财务稳定。这意味着所有在科技招聘热潮期间聘用的员工，或那些过于昂贵的员工，都不得不被裁员。

- en: Another indication is your workload. If you’ve started to see your workload
    heavily decrease and projects getting cancelled. This is something that a lot
    of people don’t initially pick up on at first, but the truth is that C-suite members

    together all the pieces of the future of the company and how to keep it going.
  id: totrans-36

  zh: 另一个迹象是你的工作负荷。如果你发现工作负荷大幅减少，项目被取消。这是很多人最初不会注意到的，但事实是，C-suite成员没有时间或财力启动新项目，因为他们正在努力整合公司未来的发展蓝图以及如何维持公司运营。
- en: I urge you to take this with a pinch of salt as these reasons may not highly
    indicate that the company is going through a rough time and layoffs are pending.
