    the Microsoft Research Asia team brought us Visual ChatGPT. Visual ChatGPT overcomes
    the current limitations in ChatGPT of not being able to process visual information
    as it’s trained with a single language modality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Visual ChatGPT is a system that incorporates Visual Foundation Models (VFM)
    to help ChatGPT better understand, generate and edit visual information. VFM have
    the ability to specify input-output formats, convert visual information to language
    format, and handle VFM histories, priorities, and conflicts.

    of ChatGPT and allowing users to communicate via chat and generate visuals.

- en: Some of you may be thinking that this is a forced workaround for ChatGPT to
    deal with visuals, as it still converts all visual signals of an image into language.
    When uploading images, the Prompt Manager synthesizes an internal chat history
    that includes information such as file name so that ChatGPT can better understand
    what the query is referring to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the name of an inputted image by the user will act as an operation
    history and then the prompt manager will assist the model to go through ‘Reasoning
    Format’ to figure out what needs to be done with the image. You can consider this
    as the model's inner thoughts before ChatGPT selects the correct VFM operation.
