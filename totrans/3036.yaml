    particular process in the pursuit of strengthening one's own interpretation of
    said process to be a worthy one. I have previously done so with alternate interpretations
    of what we could call the machine learning process (and which could reasonably
    be closely aligned with the data science or data mining processes, at least to
    some degree), of which you can find examples [here](/2016/03/data-science-process-rediscovered.html)
    and [here](/2018/05/general-approaches-machine-learning-process.html) and [here](/2018/06/keras-4-step-workflow.html).

    Francois Chollet's 4 step model (aimed at Keras, but generalizable), Yufeng Guo's
    7 steps to machine learning, and even modifications aimed specifically at more
    narrow disciplines, such as the text-based data science task framework. In an
    effort to further refine our internal models, this post will present an overview
    of Aurélien Géron's Machine Learning Project Checklist, as seen in his bestselling
    book, "[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/)."
    It's a similar approach to that of, say, Guo's 7 step process, but at a subtly
    higher level; it's presented as a checklist of approaching projects, and so it
    feels less prescriptive and more descriptive, a reminder of what you should be
    doing as you do it as opposed to some grand explanation of why you are doing what
    you are doing. This is an observation without judgment.

    anyone not yet having read Géron's book check it out for more useful information
    aimed at beginners and practitioners alike.

  prefs: []

- en: This first step is where the objective is defined. Géron refers to objectives
    in business terms, but this isn't strictly necessary. However, an understanding
    of how the machine learning system's solution will ultimately be used is important.
    This step is also where comparable scenarios and current workarounds to a given
    problem are discussed, as well as assumptions being contemplated, and the degree
    of need for human expertise determined. Other key technical items to frame in
    this step include determining which type of machine learning problem (supervised,
    unsupervised, etc.) applies, and adopting appropriate performance metric(s).

- en: 'This step is data-centric: determine how much data is needed, what type of
    data is needed, where to get the data, assess legal obligations surrounding data
    acquisition... and get the data. Once you have the data, ensure it is appropriately
    anonymized, make certain you know what type of data it actually is (time series,
    observations, images, etc.), convert the data to a format you require of it, and
    create training, validation, and testing sets as warranted.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This step in the checklist is akin to what is often referred to as Exploratory
    Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to try and gain insights from the data prior
    to modeling. Recall that in the first step assumptions about the data were to
    be identified and explored; this is a good time to more deeply investigate these
    assumptions. Human experts can be of particular use in this step, answering questions
    about correlations which may not be obvious to the machine learning practitioner.
    Studying features and their characteristics is done here, as is general visualization
    of features and their values (think of how much easier it is, for example, to
    quickly identify outliers by box plot than by numerical interrogation). Documenting
    the findings of your exploration for later use is good practice.

    step. This step also includes any data cleaning you would perform, as well as
    both feature selection and engineering. Any feature scaling for value standardization
    and/or normalization would occur here as well.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Time to model the data, and whittle the initial set of models down to what
    appear to be the most promising bunch. (This is similar to the first modeling
    step in Chollet''s process: good model → "too good" model, which you can [read
    more about here](/2018/05/general-approaches-machine-learning-process.html)) Such
    attempts may involve using samples of the full dataset to facilitate training
    times for preliminary models, models which should cut across a wide spectrum of
    categories (trees, neural networks, linear, etc.). Models should be built, measured,
    and compared to one another, and the types of errors made for each model should
    be investigated, as should the most significant features for each algorithm used.
    The best performing models should be shortlisted, which can then be fine-tuned
    afterwards.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The shortlisted models should now have their hyperparameters fine-tuned, and
    ensemble methods should be investigated at this stage. Full datasets should be
    used during this step, should dataset samples have been used in the previous modeling
    phase; no fine-tuned model should be selected as the "winner" without having been
    exposed to all training data or compared with other models which have also been
    exposed to all training data. Also, you didn't overfit, right?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on the implementation team) are up to par! This is a much less technical step,
    though ensuring proper documentation of the technical aspects of the system at
    this point is also important. Answer questions for interested parties: *Do interested
    parties understand the big picture? Does the solution achieve the objective? Have
    you conveyed assumptions and limitations?* This is essentially a sales pitch,
    so ensure the takeaway is confidence in the system. Why do all this work if the
    result isn''t understood and adopted?'

    into some wider production system or strategy. As a software solution, it will
    be exposed to unit testing prior, and should be adequately monitored once up and
    running. Retraining models on fresh or updated data is part of this process and
    should be taken into account here, even if thought had been given to this in an
    earlier step.
