    I read a lot on Towards Data Science, Medium, KDnuggets, and individual blogs
    from different data scientists and machine learning engineers for an hour or two
    or more every single day. This has taught me the importance of data science when
    it comes to industrial work:** *how much value you are adding to an organization
    with your skill set***. ***You define value by building something you have an
    interest in or by building something to solve a problem***. You choose what to
    learn by answering this question and it will give you an idea of what to learn
    and what not to.

- en: Data science is not just programming, data science is not just web-development,
    it is not just about analyzing data and building models. This is half of the story.
    Another half of data science is being able to communicate to not so tech-savvy
    people. Business stakeholders, decision-makers in management, and clients are
    three different types of non-tech people you are going to deal with. So collaborating
    with people is going to be a big pain if we think of it as “another tech job”.
    There is an excellent book on communicating data insights titled “[*Storytelling
    With Data*](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books)*”* by [Cole Nussbaumer
    Knaflic](https://medium.com/u/a7bd5fd34d07). It is kind of a must-read.

    comparisons you did, and the accuracy you achieved, how it is benefiting the business?
    You see, a data scientist’s job has no meaning if he can’t bring some profit or
    benefit or some value addition to the business. This is a hard thing to get hold
    of and become good at if you come from a tech-background like mine. What the tech-mentality
    does, in this case, is to make your mind focus only on building the model and
    analyzing data because it is what we do. ***We do not have a business context***.

    has nothing to do with the tech. I am still trying to work on it. A solution I
    have found so far is when I can’t find my way around a problem then I will get
    off the machine and go for a walk if it is evening or read a completely unrelated
    book if it is not evening (some non-fiction e.g.) or go on a motorcycle ride and
    completely forget about the problem. Then I will come back later and try to learn
    the same thing from a different article or blog post while not referring to the
    original point where I was stuck. Just a fresh new perspective on the same problem
