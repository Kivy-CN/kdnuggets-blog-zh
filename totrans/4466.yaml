- en: The risk of pneumonia is immense for many, especially in developing nations
    where billions face energy poverty and rely on polluting forms of energy. The
    WHO estimates that over 4 million premature deaths occur annually from household
    air pollution-related diseases including pneumonia. Over 150 million people get
    infected with pneumonia on an annual basis especially children under 5 years old.
    In such regions, the problem can be further aggravated due to the dearth of medical
    resources and personnel. For example, in Africa’s 57 nations, a gap of 2.3 million
    doctors and nurses exists. For these populations, accurate and fast diagnosis
    means everything. It can guarantee timely access to treatment and save much needed
    time and money for those already experiencing poverty.

    result, often many iterations are required. In this case, it is better to save
    a copy of the best performing model only when an epoch that improves the metrics
    ends.'

    gap (i.e. the difference between training and validation error) starts to increase,
    instead of decreasing. This is a symptom of overfitting that can be solved in
    many ways (*reducing model capacity*, *increasing training data*, *data augumentation*, *regularization*, *dropout*,
    etc). Often a practical and efficient solution is to stop training when the generalization
    gap is getting worse.'

    computational burden. Some research also claim that there is an optimal batch
    size for best results which could be found by investing some time on hyper-parameter
    tuning.

- en: Although this project is far from complete but it is remarkable to see the success
    of deep learning in such varied real world problems. I have demonstrated how to
    classify positive and negative pneumonia data from a collection of X-ray images.
    The model was made from scratch, which separates it from other methods that rely
    heavily on transfer learning approach. In the future this work could be extended
    to detect and classify X-ray images consisting of lung cancer and pneumonia. Distinguishing
    X-ray images that contain lung cancer and pneumonia has been a big issue in recent
    times, and our next approach should be to tackle this problem.
