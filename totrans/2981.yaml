    a contract with the US military to make AR headsets](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/22/microsoft-protest-us-army-augmented-reality-headsets).

    if you think that the work is ethical. Are you happy with the potential for the
    machine learning algorithm when applied in the world?

    is one of the best ways to prevent some of the ethical challenges that have recently
    surfaced with machine learning applications.

    algorithm for recruitmen](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G)t
    it was because of an unexpected bias identified in the training set. Though Amazon
    had tried to remove gender indicators from the system to prevent bias, the algorithm
    was able to detect them.
