- en: Do you ever feel like there are too many tools for MLOps? There's a tool for
    experiment tracking, data and model versioning, workflow orchestration, feature
    store, model testing, deployment and serving, monitoring, runtime engines, LLM
    frameworks, and more. Each category of tool has multiple options, making it confusing
    for managers and engineers who want a simple solution, a unified tool that can
    easily perform almost all the MLOps tasks. This is where end-to-end MLOps platforms
    come in.

    and enterprise projects. These platforms will enable you to create an automated
    machine learning workflow that can train, track, deploy, and monitor models in
    production. Additionally, they offer integrations with various tools and services
    you may already be using, making it easier to transition to these platforms.

    solution for the end-to-end machine learning life cycle. You can track, train,
    evaluate, and then deploy the model into production. Furthermore, you can monitor
    and retain models to maintain quality, optimize the compute resource to save cost,
    and use CI/CD pipelines to automate your MLOps workflow fully.'
