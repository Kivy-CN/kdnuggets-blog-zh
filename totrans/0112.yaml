- en: The open source Project Jupyter team has released Jupyter AI, a new extension
    that brings generative AI capabilities directly into Jupyter notebooks and the
    JupyterLab IDE. Jupyter AI lets users leverage large language models via chat
    interactions and magic commands to explain code, generate new code and content,
    answer questions about local files, and more. It was built with responsible AI
    in mind, allowing control over model selection and tracking of AI-generated output.
    Jupyter AI supports providers like Anthropic, AWS, Cohere, and OpenAI. It aims
    to make AI accessible in an ethical way to enhance the Jupyter notebook experience.

- en: The author experimented with ChatGPT prompts to create an AI-powered cover letter
    generator web application called Tally.Work in just 3 days, using Bubble.io for
    the frontend and the OpenAI API for generating text. It takes a user's resume
    and job description as inputs and outputs a customized cover letter. The goal
    was to build an app with a large potential user base. Though AI-generated text
    isn't perfect yet, it can help create a useful first draft. The author believes
    AI will eliminate many tedious tasks like cover letters, and hopes this project
    helps lead to more interesting AI apps in the future. Overall it shows how quickly
    someone can use no-code tools and AI APIs to build and launch an app idea.

    like GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion in production: their massive size leading to high
    compute costs, biases that can propagate harmful stereotypes, and inconsistent
    output quality requiring tuning. Solutions include model compression, training
    on unbiased data, post-processing filters, prompt engineering, and model fine-tuning.
    Overall it outlines how companies must carefully address these issues to successfully
    leverage generative models while avoiding potential downsides.'

    with a human. Rather than replacing the human, the AI acts as a creative partner,
    suggesting ideas and doing research. At each step, the human can accept, reject,
    or modify the AI's suggestions. One of the main challenges in writing is coming
    up with ideas. This project aims to help writers overcome writer's block by providing
    a creative partner to bounce ideas off of.

    APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16789v1)**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The paper introduces ToolLLM, a framework to enhance the tool-using abilities
    of open-source large language models. It constructs a dataset called ToolBench
    containing instructions involving 16,000 real-world APIs across 49 categories.
    ToolBench is automatically generated using ChatGPT with minimal human involvement.
    To improve reasoning, the authors propose a depth-first search decision tree method
    that allows models to evaluate multiple reasoning traces. They also develop an
    automatic evaluator ToolEval to efficiently assess tool-use capabilities. By fine-tuning
    LLaMA on ToolBench, they obtain ToolLLaMA which demonstrates strong performance
    on ToolEval, including generalizing to unseen APIs. Overall, ToolLLM provides
    a way to unlock sophisticated tool use in open-source LLMs.

    on complex tasks. It incorporates real-world standardized operating procedures
    into prompts to guide multi-agent coordination. Roles like ProductManager and
    Architect produce structured outputs matching industry conventions. A shared environment
    and memory enable knowledge sharing. On software tasks, MetaGPT generated more
    code, documents, and higher success rates than AutoGPT and AgentVerse, showing
    its ability to decompose problems across specialized agents. The standardized
    workflows and outputs aim to reduce incoherence in conversations. Overall, MetaGPT
    demonstrates a way to capture human expertise in agents to tackle intricate real-world
    problems.
