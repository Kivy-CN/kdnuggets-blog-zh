  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One process is data management. Living in a data-driven world, data management
    is an important element for organizations to leverage their data assets and ensure
    they are effective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is the process of collecting, storing, organizing and maintaining data to
    ensure that it is accurate, accessible to those who need it and reliable throughout
    your data science project lifecycle. Just like any management process, it requires
    procedures that are backed and supported by policies and technologies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although there is a lot of data out there today, data collection will still
    be a part of your role as a data scientist. Data collection and acquisition is
    the process of gathering raw data from a variety of sources such as websites,
    surveys, databases and more. This phase is very important as the quality of your
    data has a direct impact on your outcome.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need to identify different data sources and find ones that fit your
    requirements. Ensure that you have the right permissions to access these data
    sources, the reliability of the data sources, and the format is aligned with your
    scope. You can collect the data through different methods such as manual data
    entry, data extraction, and more.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have your data, the next step is cleaning it - which can take up a
    lot of your time. You will need to comb through the dataset, find any issues and
    correct them. Your end goal during this phase will be to standardize and transform
    your data so that it’s ready for analysis.
  prefs: []

    data types, outliers, data format, transformation, and more.

    analysis - store it! You don’t want to lose all those hours you just put in to
    clean it and get it to the gold standard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    organization, for example, databases or cloud storage. Again, this will all be
    based on data volume and complexity. You can also design architecture that can
    allow for efficient data retrieval and scalability.

    you to maintain all historical data and any changes to help preserve the data
    assets and long-term access.

    costs! Data breaches and privacy violations can have severe consequences, and
    you don’t want to have to deal with this problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some steps that you can take to ensure data security and privacy,
    such as access control, encryption, regular audits, data lifecycle management,
    and more. You want to ensure whatever route you take to protect your data that
    it is compliant with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to ensure data quality and accountability throughout the data lifecycle,
    data governance and documentation are essential to your data management process.
    This process involves having policies, processes and best practices in place to
    ensure that your data is well-managed and all your assets are protected. The main
    aim of this is to provide transparency and compliance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All these policies and processes should be documented comprehensively to provide
    insight into how the data is structured, stored, and used. This builds trust within
    an organization, and how they use data to drive the decision-making process to
    steer away from risks and find new opportunities.
  prefs: []

    maintaining an audit trail and providing data lineage.

    can imagine how messy it can get. You have one data scientist working on the same
    dataset that another data scientist is doing further cleaning on.

- en: To ensure data management within the team, it is always good to communicate
    your tasks so that you do not overlap with one another, or one person has a better
    version of a dataset than someone else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Collaboration within a data science team ensures that the data is accessible
    and valuable to different stakeholders. To improve collaboration and sharing within
    a data science team, you can have data-sharing platforms, use collaborative tools
    such as Tableau, put access controls in place, and allow feedback.
