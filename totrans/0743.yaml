  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s start with what ChatGPT teams have created for us, the [Data Analyst](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-HMNcP6w7d-data-analyst).
    This is the Custom GPT, trained explicitly to analyze our data and visualize them
    as we need. By dropping the file, such as CSV files, and providing the prompt
    to what we need, the Data Analyst GPT could do the job automatically.
  prefs: []

    For many data science activities, it’s not always about researching and model
    development. There are many times that we need to visualize our workflow and provide
    an explanation of how our work would be. This is where Whimsical Diagrams GPT
    would help you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This GPT is designed to explain and visualize concepts with flowcharts, mindmaps,
    and sequence diagrams. Providing the prompt and data source we have could help
    us deliver visualization that would help our work.
