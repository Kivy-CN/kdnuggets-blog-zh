    mean value. Using the iris dataset, the probability distributions for the sepal
    length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width can be generated using the
    code below.

    interval is the range of values that are one standard deviation from the mean
    value. The 95% confidence interval is the range of values that are two standard
    deviations from the mean value. The boxplot below shows the mean value and 65%
    confidence interval for the sepal length feature.

    feature only has 150 data points. Suppose that we would like to generate more
    data points. Then assuming that the sepal length feature is normally distributed,
    we can generate more data points. In the example below, we generate N = 1000 data
    points for the sepal length feature.
