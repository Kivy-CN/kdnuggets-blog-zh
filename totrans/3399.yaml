- en: I have been using Lean Six Sigma (LSS) to improve business processes for the
    past 10+ year and am very satisfied with its benefits. Recently, I’ve been working
    with a consulting firm and a software vendor to implement a machine learning (ML)
    model to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of service parts. The result which
    I feel most frustrated is the low accuracy of the resulting model. As shown below,
    if people measure the deviation as the absolute difference between the actual
    part life and the predicted one, the resulting model has 127, 60, and 36 days
    of average deviation for the selected 3 parts. I could not understand why the
    deviations are so large with machine learning.

    can improve the deviation only by 10% through data cleansing. This puzzles me
    a lot. To me, such deviation, even after the 10% improvement, still renders the
    forecast useless to the business owners. This forces me to ask myself the following
    questions:'

- en: The objective of the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is to improve process performance
    by reducing its variance. The variance is defined as the sum squared errors (differences)
    between the LSS actual and forecast measures. The result of the LSS essentially
    is a statistical function (model) between a set of input / independent variables
    and the output / dependent variable(s), as show in the chart below.

- en: By identifying the correlations between the input and output variables, the
    LSS model tells us how we can control the input variables in order to move the
    output variable(s) into our target values. Most importantly, LSS also requires
    the monitored process to be “stable”, i.e., minimizing the output variable variance,
    by minimizing the input variable variance, in order to achieve the so called “breakthrough”
    state.

    control (the spread around the target in the left chart), there is no guarantee
    about the target you have achieved; if you reduce the variance without getting
    to the target (right chart), you miss your target. Only by keeping the variance
    small and center, LSS is able to ensure the process target is reached with precise
    precision and with a sustainable and optimal process performance. This is the
    major contribution of LSS.

    variables and output variable(s) to come up with an “approximation” of the ideal
    function, as shown by the green curve below.

- en: It is well known that, due to bias and normal randomness, a process is subject
    to be random in nature; i.e., a process with variance. Therefore, both classical
    statistics and LSS have shown that, if input variables have large variance, we
    would expect large variance of the output variable(s).

- en: This would strongly suggest the inaccuracy of the machine learning model, when
    input variables have large variance. This is why, I think, my recent machine learning
    project has such large inaccuracy in its prediction, and also the reason why the
    data cleansing can improve the accuracy only up to 10%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People may argue that the data cleansing can improve the quality of prediction.
    Well, the problem is that the data cleansing of ML is not the same as the variance
    reduction of LSS. In LSS, people would go back to examine the business process
    to find the source of variance of the input variables in order to eliminate the
    bias or reduce the variance of those input variables (factors), whereas, in ML,
    people do not go back to revisit the business process; instead, people in ML only
    try to correct data errors or eliminate data which do not make sense. As a result,
    such data cleansing approach does not actually reduce variance; actually, it may
    not change the input variance at all. Therefore, the ML model is not expected
    to work well, if people do not understand the role of variance.

    cleansing, we would get the red curve as the optimal ML. But, if the right chart
    below represents the data points after variance reduction, the resulting ML model
    would be much accurate.

- en: In summary, I think the current data cleansing of ML model needs to include
    the variance reduction technique of LSS in order to have an accurate, reliable,
    and effective model for both supervised and unsupervised learning. People need
    to spend effort to review underlying business process to reduce input variance
    to make it work better for real world problems.

    reduction technique in the data cleansing phase of ML to deliver real value of
    ML.
