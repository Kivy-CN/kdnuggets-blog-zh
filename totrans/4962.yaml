    18th annual KDnuggets Software Poll again got huge participation from analytics
    and data science community and vendors, attracting about 2,900 voters, almost
    exactly the same as last year. This post has the initial analysis - here is the
    more detailed look: [Emerging Ecosystem: Data Science and Machine Learning Software,
    Analyzed](/2017/06/ecosystem-data-science-machine-learning-software.html).'

    has finally caught up with R, and (barely) overtook it, with 52.6% respondents
    using it vs 52.1% for R.

- en: The biggest surprise is probably the phenomenal share of Deep Learning tools,
    now used by 32% of all respondents, while only 18% used DL in 2016 and 9% in 2015.
    Google Tensorflow rapidly became the leading Deep Learning platform with 20.2%
    usage, up from only 6.8% in 2016 poll, and entered the top 10 tools.

    being R, Python, SQL, and SAS, the 5 main languages of Data Science in 2017 appear
    to be Python, R, SQL, Spark, and Tensorflow.

    had equal chances, so this does not violate KDnuggets guidelines. We have not
    seen any bot voting or direct links to vote for only one tool this year.

    and Octave are losing to Python and R, RapidInsight perhaps did not remind its
    users to vote, QlikView is probably losing to Tableau, and C4.5 is old technology.
    What is interesting is the decline in usage for Hadoop Open Source Tools, for
    MLlib and Other free analytics/data mining tools.
