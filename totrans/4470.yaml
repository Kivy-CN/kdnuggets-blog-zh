- en: Almost two years ago now, my colleague Alexander Ng [shared our thinking](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/torus-docker-first-data-science.html) around
    why the rise of Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs) meant we needed a DevOps approach
    to machine learning (ML), and why our team created an open-source tool to make
    life easier for other teams doing AI and data science. The 1.0 release of Orbyter
    (called Torus at the time) focused on helping to streamline ML pipelines by making
    it dead simple to spin up a fully configured, out-of-the-box, Dockerized local
    development setup for data science projects.

    already familiar with the dichotomy of inherent complexity versus incidental complexity

- en: All complexity in software can be accurately thought of as falling into one
    of the two sides of this dichotomy of inherent and incidental. Take everything
    that sucks about your software, subtract out anything that sucks because it's
    a hard problem, and you're left with the (molehill or mountain, I'll let you choose)
    of incidental complexity...

    the [Python PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standard using included
    local scripts. It also has ready-to-go continuous integration with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
    so when you push your code to GitHub it automatically does a lint check and runs
    the unit tests. A YAML file provides a single place for you to configure robust
    logging. In addition, the code is scaffolded to conform to an isolated input/output
    architecture that allows rapid iteration in a data pipeline. We have also prescribed
    some clearly defined endpoints — train, predict, evaluate — as Click command line
    scripts that can be called as a Docker entry point.

- en: While many organizations now have robust data science teams that do important
    experiments and modeling R&D, those same companies often struggle to move the
    results of that work [from the lab to the factory](https://hbr.org/2013/04/two-departments-for-data-succe).
    No one wants to see their hard work languish in a silo; the thrill is seeing your
    models make an impact in the real world. But it takes a lot of engineering work
    to make that transition happen, and many organizations are still ill-equipped
    for production deployment.

- en: 'To address that disconnect, we''ve added a new container with MLflow. Orbyter
    1.0 offered a single container and was a fork of the popular [Cookiecutter Data
    Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/), great for easily
    setting up a Dockerized workflow. Orbyter 2.0 is still fundamentally Dockerized
    data science, but now when you start it up, you get three different containers:
    the first offers Jupyter, as before; the second offers Bash, for running scripts;
    and the third offers [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), for experiment tracking.'

    of using MLflow for that step. It can also help with packaging for reproducible
    runs and sending models to deployment.
