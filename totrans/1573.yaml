    a broad reach, interactive notebooks, state-of-the-art surveys, and scholarly
    research retrospectives to textbooks and educational materials, the books will
    be suitable for a wide audience (data scientists, computer scientists, mathematicians,
    statisticians, engineers, and physical and life scientists), and be relevant to
    all career levels—students, researchers, practitioners, educators—and all sectors
    of employment—academia, industry, government, education.

- en: '“There’s a ton of work on data science out there, but people need help finding
    it, understanding it, making sense of it, and figuring out how to apply it. The
    goal is to publish state-of-the-art research with exposition tailored to specific
    groups within the vast data science audience: hands-on textbooks for students,
    focused monographs for researchers, tutorials for do-it-yourselfers, and state-of-the-art
    surveys for those just wanting to glimpse the lay of the land.”'

- en: SIAM is well-positioned to achieve these goals, according to Ipsen, because
    “SIAM embraces the wide variety of computational research areas and its members
    come from diverse employment situations. This makes for a huge pool of authors
    who have a vast amount of expertise and experience to draw from.”
