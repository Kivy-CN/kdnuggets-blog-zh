    It sounds like something straight out of a science fiction movie but with the
    recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it is becoming a reality.
    Though neuroscientists still struggle to truly demystify how the human brain converts
    what our eyes see into mental images, it seems like AI is getting better at this
    task. Two researchers, from the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences at Osaka
    University, proposed a new method using an LDM named Stable Diffusion that accurately
    reconstructed the images from human brain activity that was obtained by functional
    magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Although the paper “[High-resolution image
    reconstruction with latent diffusion models from human brain activity“](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.full) 
    by [Yu Takagi](https://yu-takagi.github.io/) and [Shinji Nishimotois](https://cinet.jp/english/people/20141086/)
    is not yet peer-reviewed, it has taken the internet by storm as the results are
    shockingly accurate.

    and even the criminal justice system. Imagine a suspect is questioned about where
    he was during the time of the murder and he answers that he was home. But the
    reconstructed image shows him at the crime scene. Pretty Interesting right? So
    how does it exactly work? Let's dig deeper into this research paper, its limitations,
    and its future scope.

     provided by the University of Minnesota. It contained data obtained from fMRI
    scans of four subjects who had looked at 10,000 different images. A subset of
    982 images viewed by all four subjects was used as the test dataset. Two different
    AI models were trained during the process. One was used to link the brain activity
    with the fMRI images while the other one was used to link it with the text descriptions
    of images that the subjects looked at. Together, these models allowed the Stable
    Diffusion to turn the fMRI data into relatively accurate imitations of the images
    that were not part of its training achieving an accuracy of almost 80%.

    of the image being viewed. But the model struggled with specific objects such
    as the clock tower and It created abstract and cloudy figures. Instead of using
    large datasets to predict more details, researchers used the second AI model to
    associate the keywords from image captions to fMRI scans. For example, if the
    training data has a picture of a clock tower then the system associates the pattern
    of brain activity with that object. During the testing stage, if a similar brain
    pattern was exhibited by the subject participant then the System feds the objects
    keyword into Stable Diffusion’s normal text-to-image generator that resulted in
    the convincing imitation of the real image.

    its kind where each component of LDM (Stable diffusion) was quantitatively interpreted
    from a neuroscience perspective. They did so by mapping the specific components
    to the distinct regions of the brain. Although the proposed model is still in
    the nascent stage yet people were quick to react to this paper and termed the
    model as the next mind reader.

    brain scan of the people who provided the training brain scans. Using the same
    data for training and test sets can lead to overfitting. However, we should not
    shrug off this paper as such publications attract researchers and we start seeing
    related papers with incremental improvements.

    me think: **Will we be able to relive our dreams soon?** Pretty cool and scary
    at the same time. Although it''s quite intriguing, it raises some ethical concerns
    about the invasion of privacy. Also, there is still a long way to go before we
    can actually create the subjective experience of a dream. The model is not yet
    practical for daily use but we are getting closer to understanding how our brain
    functions. Such technology can also bring about tremendous advancements in the
    medical field, especially for people who have communication impairments.'
