- en: In this article, I am going to map out the things you need to do to become a
    Data Scientist. This article may solely be for beginners, however, there may be
    a thing or two that current Junior Data Scientists may have missed out on. This
    is where I am here to help fill in those gaps so that you don’t have to feel imposter
    syndrome or lack confidence in your data science journey.
