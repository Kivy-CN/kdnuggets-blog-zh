    learning problems, many of them quite good. But how many of them are written by
    a 4x Kaggle Grandmaster?

- en: '[Abhishek Thakur](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek), the 4x Grandmaster in question
    — who now works on NLP at Hugging Face — wrote and released his book **[Approaching
    (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/approachingalmost)**
    (AAAMLP) last year. The book can be [purchased through Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/8269211508)
    for a very reasonable price, much more so than most other books of similar content.'

- en: The second point is easily explained in that this is definitely not a "start
    from zero" machine learning book. If you aren't already comfortable with basic
    machine learning concepts and Python programming, you need to look elsewhere for
    learning materials.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first point can be explained in part in that AAAMLP is designed as a code-along
    book, which is the reason why its code is not explicitly shared separately on
    its Github repo. You want to understand and implement the suggested approaches
    contained within? You have to read and type out the code as you go, better ensuring
    an understanding of what it is you are doing. This is not like most other books.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, the latter half of the book focuses on comprehensive approaches to solving
    particular machine learning problem types, with chapters appropriately dedicated
    to these different types. This is also, generally speaking, not like most other
    books.

- en: You can see that some time is spent early on with more basic concepts, but even
    these aren't your typical book-based explanations. You get right into their practical
    usefulness as well as how to code the concepts for your own projects.

- en: Once the vital foundational topic chapters of supervised vs unsupervised learning,
    cross-validation and evaluation metrics are out of the way, the task of project-centric
    approaches to arranging your code and other files is taken up, followed by several
    more practical data pre-processing and preparation chapters. After this, practical
    hyperparameter optimization is covered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once these chapters are finished, the more comprehensive treatments of specific
    types of problem approaches are tackled, including image classification, text
    classification, ensembling, and reproducibility and model serving. It is in these
    chapters that the book really shines, moving from being useful in a practical
    sense of what you might be trying to accomplish, to being a great guidebook and
    what you can accomplish by following Thakur's map.

- en: A great companion piece to this book is [Thakur's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/AbhishekThakurAbhi).
    Besides some great discussions and input from others, Thakur has video coding
    walkthroughs of a number of the concepts that have chapters dedicated to them
    in the book. This makes for a great way to reinforce and get additional insight
    on these topics. I highly recommend his channel as a resource beyond a book mate
    as well.

- en: If you enjoy the book, you should consider supporting Thakur's work by purchasing
    a copy of AAAMLP, as both Kindle and paperback format copies are very reasonably
    priced. Regardless, Thakur asks that anyone who reads the books consider leaving
    a review on Google, Amazon, or Goodreads.

- en: AAAMLP is a unique book, blending practical "*how to*" with demonstrative "*could
    do*" and serving as a great guidebook to anyone looking to get serious about implementing
    machine learning solutions. I highly recommend both the book and author Abhishek
    Thakur's YouTube channel.
