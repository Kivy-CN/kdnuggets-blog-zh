    Although there are many BootCamps and courses out there that complement your resume,
    many recruiters are looking for candidates with some form of technical degree
    and/or master's degree.

    and online courses to get you to the level of knowledge required to comfortably
    apply for Data Science roles. There is the possibility of going self-taught, however,
    that requires a lot more independent effort and determination. It’s a harder route,
    but it can happen.

    they want to have a great understanding just in case someone asks them a question.
    However, try not to dig too deep into it and start to focus on projects which
    present your skills and practical applications.
