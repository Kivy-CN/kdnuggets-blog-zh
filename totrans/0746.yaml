    But, if you only have time to spend in five different communities, these are the
    ones you should focus on.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with the one that seems casual, which is Reddit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, Reddit is a social network forum famous for memes and random discussions
    about life. However, it is still a social media platform with a bulletin board
    structure that leads to many casual discussions. One of them is for data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reddit is actually bustling with activities for any data science enthusiast
    and professional alike. What’s important is to find the specific communities within
    Reddit that could facilitate our learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For that, I recommend joining the [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience)
    community, which boasts 1.4 million members and has new daily discussions. Almost
    every day, there would be a discussion regarding the data science topics. From
    casual questions to advanced career moves, the community is lively to have discussions
    with everyone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, [r/machinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/)
    is a great community to join if you want to discuss machine learning specific
    topics with over 2.9 million other members.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next community you should join is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am sure many of you who have started learning data science have heard about
    it. But, if you have never heard about Kaggle, it’s a platform to share and publish
    datasets, explore and build machine learning models with the notebook, and share
    all our data works. It’s also the hub for data science competition, as many companies
    hold online competitions on this platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kaggle's premise is to share our data science works with the public, so it has
    become a central place for many data people to communicate. I have already gotten
    so much help from the community there for my personal and professional work that
    I feel it’s one of the best communities out there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s because many helpful information and breakthroughs are implemented there,
    which is a great way to learn new skills for advancing your career. Moreover,
    many professionals and experts contribute a lot to the community for free.

    platform. However, it’s still social media as a core.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LinkedIn allows its users to create community groups where like-minded people
    can post and share their thoughts. One of the biggest LinkedIn Data Science community
    groups is the [Data Science Community (moderated)](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3063585/)
    by Robbert van Vlijmen, which has more than 500.000 members.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The members often share useful learning material and provide a place where you
    can ask any questions, regardless of your professional level. So, don’t feel pressured
    if you think the discussion seems too hard to follow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another LinkedIn group I recommended joining is the [KDnuggets Data Science
    & Machine Learning (Moderated)](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/54257/). With
    more than 150.000 members inside, there is a daily post from the members that
    would help you learn, including the newest article from KDNuggets, which you can
    discuss inside.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, hear me out. The community may not necessarily be specific to data science,
    as MLOps is part of the data science. However, a successful data science project
    is where we could provide continuous value to the business, and MLOps provides
    that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s why I recommend the MLOps community as a place that could help you in
    your future career. I state this as well because MLOps is becoming a skill that
    many data science jobs try to look for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The community, especially the slack, is active with many conversations about
    MLOps and sometimes a general discussion. Nevertheless, I gained many insight
    there, and you should also be.
