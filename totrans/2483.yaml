    people tell it like magic that solves everything, and as a leader you want to
    solve your problems in your business. You started hiring data scientists and asked
    them to do X, you keep hearing they are having “very good accuracy results in
    the test data set”, you like what you hear; you have heard that is something good.
    After some time, you wanted to use it in your day-to-day operations and it just
    started failing. So, what is happening? What is going on?

    the conversion rate, that could be wrong.

    metric to evaluate the performance of the data scientist team. As you can easily

    team can measure is the *click-through rate (CTR)* which measures how many of
    the recommended items has been clicked on. The next level metric can be the *add-to-basket
    rate* which can be used to measure how many of the recommended items has been
    added to the basket. And, it goes on like that …

    are also not an exception. Developing a machine learning project is a highly iterative
    process and excepting it to have a successful final result on the first try is
    a mistake. The data scientist team may have good accuracy results on the test
    data set but when it comes to the real world, the game changes.

    Build a process that the data scientist team will get feedback from the production
    system. Do not see machine learning projects as a technical problem, machine learning
    brings changes to the organization and may require the collaboration of many moving
    parts in the company.
