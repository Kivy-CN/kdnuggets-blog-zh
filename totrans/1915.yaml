- en: Machine learning (ML) is the motor that drives data science. Each ML method
    (also called an algorithm) takes in data, turns it over, and spits out an answer.
    ML algorithms do the part of data science that is the trickiest to explain and
    the most fun to work with. That’s where the mathematical magic happens.

- en: ML algorithms can be grouped into families based on the type of question they
    answer. These can help guide your thinking as you are formulating your razor sharp
    question.

    for any question that has just two possible answers: yes or no, on or off, smoking
    or non-smoking, purchased or not. Lots of data science questions sound like this
    or can be re-phrased to fit this form. It’s the simplest and most commonly asked
    data science question. Here are few typical examples.'

- en: 'This algorithm family is called **multi-class classification**. Like its name
    implies, it answers a question that has several (or even many) possible answers:
    which flavor, which person, which part, which company, which candidate. Most multi-class
    classification algorithms are just extensions of two-class classification algorithms.
    Here are a few typical examples.'

- en: This family of algorithms performs **anomaly detection**. They identify data
    points that are not normal. If you are paying close attention, you noticed that
    this looks like a binary classification question. It can be answered yes or no.
    The difference is that binary classification assumes you have a collection of
    examples of both yes and no cases. Anomaly detection doesn’t. This is particularly
    useful when what you are looking for occurs so rarely that you haven’t had a chance
    to collect many examples of it, like equipment failures. It’s also very helpful
    when there is a lot of variety in what constitutes “not normal,” as there is in
    credit card fraud detection.  Here are some typical anomaly detection questions.

- en: Usually, regression algorithms give a real-valued answer; the answers can have
    lots of decimal places or even be negative. For some questions, especially questions
    beginning “How many…”, negative answers may have to be re-interpreted as zero
    and fractional values re-interpreted as the nearest whole number.
