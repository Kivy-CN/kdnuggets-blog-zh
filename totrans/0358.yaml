    will be to learn how to code. My recommendation will be [Python](https://www.python.org/),
    as it is arguably the most popular programming language for data science.

    that is truly wrong. I did a BootCamp that did not touch on the mathematical side
    - and I definitely realized it played a big weakness in my proficiency in the
    field.

    regression, probability and statistics. Learning the math behind data science
    will be highly beneficial for your data science career and noticed by your employer.
