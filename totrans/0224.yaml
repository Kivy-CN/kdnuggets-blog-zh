    I see too many machine learning models failing to deliver. Sadly, it’s often due
    to a lack of focus on data quality.

    been pre-trained on all text or images on the Internet; they understand language
    rules. Since your model needs a huge generalization capability, it needs very
    little data. As a result, every data will have a stronger impact. Thus instead
    of annotating a large volume of data with potential errors, you need to annotate
    less and be more precise about the examples you feed your model, as bad data can
    easily influence them.
