    mathematical rigor, we can better understand how machine learning models learn,
    adjust their parameters, and improve their predictions.

    This method accelerates convergence by benefiting from the computational advantages
    of matrix operations and offers a compromise between the stability of Batch Gradient

- en: Gradient descent can sometimes converge to a local minimum, which is not the
    optimal solution for the entire function. This is particularly problematic in
    complex landscapes with multiple valleys. To overcome this, incorporating momentum
    helps the algorithm navigate through valleys without getting stuck. Additionally,
    advanced optimization algorithms like Adam combine the benefits of momentum and
    adaptive learning rates to ensure more robust convergence to global minima.

- en: Vanishing & Exploding Gradients
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In deep neural networks, as gradients are back-propagated, they can diminish
    to near zero (vanish) or grow exponentially (explode). Vanishing gradients slow
    down training, making it hard for the network to learn, while exploding gradients
    can cause the model to diverge. To mitigate these issues, gradient clipping sets
    a threshold value to prevent gradients from becoming too large. On the other hand,
    normalized initialization techniques, like He or Xavier initialization, ensure
    that the weights are set to optimal values at the start, reducing the risk of
    these challenges.
