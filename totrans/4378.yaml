    and 10% in complaining about the data. Their complaints may range from data size,
    faulty data distributions, Null values, data randomness, systematic errors in
    data capture, differences between train and test sets and the list just goes on
    and on.

- en: One common bottleneck theme is the enormity of data size where either the data
    doesn't fit into memory or the processing time is so large(In order of multi-mins)
    that the inherent pattern analysis goes for a toss. Data scientists by nature
    are curious human beings who want to identify and interpret patterns normally
    hidden from cursory Drag-N-Drop glance. They need to wear multiple hats and make
    the data confess via repeated tortures(read iterations ????)

    the data scientists waiting for 5+ minutes to read a csv file(55 Mn rows) or do
    a column add followed by aggregation. Also, since the majority of Data Scientists
    are self-taught and they have been so much used to pandas data frame API that
    they wouldn''t want to start the learning process all over again with a different
    API like numba, Spark or datatable. I have tried juggling between DPLYR(R), Pandas(Python)
    and pyspark(Spark) and it is a bit unfulfilling/unproductive considering the need
    for a uniform pipeline and code syntax. However, for the curious folks, I have
    written a pyspark starter guide here: [https://medium.com/@ravishankar_22148/billions-of-rows-milliseconds-of-time-pyspark-starter-guide-c1f984023bf2](https://medium.com/@ravishankar_22148/billions-of-rows-milliseconds-of-time-pyspark-starter-guide-c1f984023bf2)'

- en: What makes Dask so popular is the fact that it makes analytics scalable in Python
    and not necessarily need switching back and forth between SQL, Scala and Python.The
    magical feature is that this tool requires minimum code changes. It breaks down
    computation into pandas data frames and thus operates in parallel to enable fast
    calculations.

- en: Dask is a powerful tool offering parallel computing, big data handling and creating
    end to end Data Science pipeline. It has a steep learning curve as the API is
    almost similar to pandas and it can handle Out Of Memory computations(~10X of
    RAM) like a breeze.

    perform any Dask Operations or even for a general chit-chat. Happy Learning!!!
