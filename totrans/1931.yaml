    tools we use and actions we take consume and generate a digital version of our
    world, all captured, waiting to be used. Data have become a real resource of interest
    across most industries and is rightly considered the gateway to competitive advantage and
    disruptive strategy.

    its potential. One is called Data Science and the other Big Data. These terms
    are often used interchangeably despite having fundamentally different roles to
    play in bringing the potential of data to the doorstep of an organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although some would argue there is still confusion over the terms Data Science and
    Big Data, this has more to do with marketing interests than an honest look at
    what these terms have come to mean on real-world projects.  Data Science looks
    to create models that capture the underlying patterns of complex systems, and
    codify those models into working applications. Big Data looks to collect and manage large
    amounts of varied data to serve large-scale web applications and vast sensor networks.

    rush to fit a company’s arsenal with data-savvy technologies.  Value is too often
    framed as something that increases solely by the collection of more data. This
    means investments in data-focused activities center around tools instead of approaches.
    The engineering cart gets put before the scientific horse, leaving an organization
    with a big set of tools, and a small amount of knowledge on how to convert data
    into something useful.

    to turn raw extracted material into a variety of valuable products. Using domain
    specific tools, the Blacksmith forges, draws, bends, punches and welds the raw
    material into objects of great utility.  Through years of research, trial and
    error the Blacksmith learned to use choice gases, specific temperatures, controlled
    atmospheres and varied ore sources to yield a tailored product bespoke to its
    unique application.

- en: With the Industrial Revolution came the ability to convert raw material into
    valuable products more efficiently and at scale.  But the focus on scaling wasn’t
    the acquisition of more material. It was on building tools that scaled and mechanized
    the expertise in converting. With this mechanization came an even greater need
    to understand the craft since to effectively operate, maintain and innovate at
    scale one had to deeply understand the process of converting raw material into
    products that answered to the always-changing demands of the market.

- en: In the world of data this expertise in converting is called Data Science. The
    reason it takes a science to convert a raw resource into something of value is
    because what is extracted from the ‘ground’ is never in a useful form. ‘Data in
    the raw’ is littered with useless noise, irrelevant information, and misleading
    patterns. To convert this into that precious thing we are after requires a study
    of its properties and the discovery of a working model that captures the behavior
    we are interested in. Being in possession of a model despite the noise means an
    organization now owns the beginnings of further discovery and innovation. Something
    unique to their business that has given them the knowledge of what to look for,
    and the codified descriptions of a world that can now be mechanized and scaled.

    place to turn that resource into value. In any industry, that would be considered
    a bad venture.  Loading the truck with ore only to have it arrive at an empty
    workshop adds little strategic benefit.

- en: An unfortunate aspect of Big Data is that we look to the largest companies to
    see what solutions they have engineered to compete in their markets. But these
    companies hardly represent the challenges faced by most organizations. Their dominance
    often means they face very different competition and their engineering is done predominantly to serve large-scale
    applications.  This engineering is critical for daily operations, and answering
    to the demands of high throughput and fault-tolerant architectures. But it says
    very little about the ability to discover and convert what is collected into valuable
    models that capture the driving forces behind how their markets operate. The ability
    to explain and predict an organization’s dynamic environment is what it means
    to compete using data.

- en: Understanding the distinction between Data Science and Big Data is critical
    to investing in a sound data strategy. For organizations looking to utilize their
    data as a competitive asset, the initial investment should be focused on converting
    data into value. The focus should be on the Data Science needed to build models
    that move data from raw to relevant. With time, Big Data approaches can work in
    concert with Data Science. The increased variety of data extracted can help make new
    discoveries or improve an existing model’s ability to predict or classify.
