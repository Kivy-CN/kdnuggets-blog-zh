    in nature. They are also known as Dirichlet tessellation or Thiessen polygons.
    Although they are referred to as such complex names, Voronoi diagrams are simple
    but have remarkable properties and attribute to different sectors, from computer
    science to art.'

    used a Voronoi diagram of the location of water pumps in each polygon to identify
    a particular pump as the source of the infection to count deaths. Interesting
    right? So what is this diagram?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Voronoi diagram is a type of diagram that has scattered random points (n)
    on a Euclidean plane. The plane is then divided up into cells around each point
    which encloses the portion of the plane that is the closest to each point - creating
    a tessellating polygon that covers the plane.

    point is enclosed in a cell that is equidistant between two or more points.

    in the middle of each cell - but not all. The boundary of a cell is based on the
    distance to the points around it, in which the lines that are creating the cells
    divide the space between the points perfectly.

    to find out more information. Sounds similar to K-nearest neighbors - an algorithm
    used to make predictions on the test data set by calculating the distance between

- en: Delaunay triangulation sometimes also referred to as Delone triangulation is
    the triangulation formation of the nerve of the cells in a Voronoi diagram. To
    put this in a simpler form, if you were to take each point in a Voronoi diagram
    and link it to the point of its neighboring cells - and there you have it - you
    will have created a Delaunay triangulation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lloyd's algorithm also known as Voronoi iteration generates a centroidal Voronoi
    tessellation. This means that the data point for each of the Voronoi cells is
    also referred to as the centroid. The algorithm repeatedly moves each point toward
    the centroid of the Voronoi cell and then re-partitions the input point according
    to its closest centroid. Just like k-means clustering.

- en: Through each iteration, the algorithm will eventually space the points apart
    by creating more Voronoi-like cells.
