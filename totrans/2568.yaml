    Initially incubated by Uber and now part of the Linux AI Foundation, Ludwig provides
    one of the best low-code machine learning(ML) stacks in the current market. Last
    week, Ludwig’s 0.4 was open sourced and includes a set of cool capabilities that
    could make it even a stronger fit for real world ML solutions.

    training and evaluating machine learning models for a given scenario. Think about
    configuring rather than coding machine learning models. Ludwig provides a set
    of model architectures that can be combined together to create an end-to-end model
    optimized for a specific set of requirements. Conceptually, Ludwig was designed
    based on a series of principles:'

    models to interact with the top ML stacks in the current market. From that perspective,
    Ludwig adds a layer of simplicity and a consistent experience for data science
    teams looking to leverage the best-of-breed ML frameworks in their solutions.

- en: By far my favorite feature of this release was the integration with the Ray
    platform. Ray is one of the most complete stacks for highly scalable ML training
    and optimization processes. In Ludwig 0.4, data scientists can scale training
    workloads from a single laptop to a large Ray cluster using a few lines of configuration
    code.

    search in large clusters of nodes. Ludwig 0.4 integrates Ray Tune allowing distributed
    hyperparameter search algorithms such as [Population-Based Training](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/tune/api_docs/schedulers.html#tune-scheduler-pbt), [Bayesian
    Optimization](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/tune/api_docs/suggestion.html#bayesopt),

- en: TabNet is one of the top deep learning stacks for tabular data which incorporate
    cutting edge features such as attention architectures. The new release of Ludwig
    enables a declarative experience for tabular models by adding a new TabNet combiner
    which also includes tabular feature transformation and attention mechanisms to
    achieve state-of-the-art performance.

    tracking and model serving. Ludwig 0.4 enables MLflwo-based experiment tracking
    with a single command line. Additionally, the new version of Ludwig can deploy
    a ML model to the MLflow registry using a simple command line statement.
