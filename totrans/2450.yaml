    AI-enabled applications have extensively increased in the market. We have also
    been ‘blessed’ with powerful infrastructure and advanced algorithms. However,
    that does not make the journey of taking your ML project to production any easy.

    is as good as the data it is trained on. Hence, good quality data becomes imperative
    and a basic building block of an ML pipeline. The ML model can only be as good

    structure. As most organizations maintain multiple sources of data, the data preparation
    by combining multiple data sources to bring all necessary attributes in a single
    flat file is a time and resource (domain expertise) expensive process.
  prefs: []

    strict peer review to ensure that the domain-established logic has been communicated,

    to data acquisition, cleaning, transformations, linking, and integration become
    critical.

- en: 'A very popular notion among most the data scientists is that the data preparation,
    cleaning, and transformation take up the majority of the model building time –
    and it is an absolute truth. Hence, it is advised not to rush through the data
    to feed into the model and perform extensive data quality checks. Though the number
    and type of checks one can perform on the data can be very subjective, we will
    discuss some of the key factors to be checked in the data while preparing data
    quality score and assessing the goodness of data:'

    Multiple vendors have different approaches to collecting and labeling data with

    a single record is very important and needs validation from a domain expert. Removing
    duplicates on this group leaves you with distinct records necessary for model

    to the origin of a biased dataset and calls for deeper investigation. Also, removing
    the observations from the data with more null/missing values can lead to the elimination
    of data representing certain groups of people (e.g. gender, or race). Hence, misrepresented
    data will produce biased results and is not only flawed at the model output level
    but is also against the fairness principles of ethical and responsible use of
    AI. Another way you may find the missing attributes is “at random”.  Blindly removing
    a certain important attribute due to a high missingness quotient can harm the
    model by reducing its predictive power.'

- en: The most common way to impute missing values is by mean values at a particular
    dimension level. For example, the average number of conversions from the Delhi
    to Bengaluru route can be used to impute the missing value of the conversions
    for the route on a given day. To add on to a similar note, one may calculate the
    average of all high-running routes like Delhi to Mumbai, Delhi to Kolkata, Delhi
    to Chennai for imputing missing conversions value.

    to be normalized into one single view to training the algorithm on previously
