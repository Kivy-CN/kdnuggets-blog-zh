- en: Prefect is an open-source workflow orchestration tool created to handle the
    modern data stack. Prefect is built on top of Dask, allowing parallel execution
    of workflows. Coiled helps data scientists use Python for ambitious problems,
    scaling to the cloud for computing power, ease, and speed—all tuned for the needs
    of teams and enterprises. This means Coiled and Prefect have a very strong synergy.
    In this demo example, we’ll also show how to spin up a Coiled cluster to execute
    Prefect jobs during runtime. The Coiled cluster will provide parallelism for dynamically
    mapped tasks in Prefect.
