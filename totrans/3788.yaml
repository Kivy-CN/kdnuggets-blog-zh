- en: Go programming language has exploded in popularity among developers as a general-purpose
    language. It's fast, simple, and powerful, perfect for building Web applications,
    Mobile applications, and System programming. Recently, Go has begun sneaking into
    the realm of machine learning and data analysis, making it a compelling choice
    for data science projects.

- en: If you're looking to learn a new language that will help you with data analysis
    and visualization tasks more efficiently, Go might be the perfect choice for you.
    In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of setting up Go, performing data analysis
    and visualization, and building a simple KNN classifier.

- en: The data science packages in the Go language are not maintained well and do
    not have a large community of developers building tools for data scientists. But,
    the main advantage of the Go language is its speed and ease of use. There are
    many other benefits of using the Go language, which may convince people to switch
    their workflow to it.
