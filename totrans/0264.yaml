    AI development. Although many applications and products out there are simply “*Mechanical
    Turks*” — which means machines that pretend to be automatized while a hidden person
    is actually doing all the work — there have been many interesting advancements
    in speech recognition from the symbolic or statistical learning approaches.

    bots with respect to traditional NLP (i.e., bag-of-words clustering, TF-IDF, etc.)
    and is creating the concept of “*conversation-as-a-platform*”, which is disrupting
    the apps market.

    living in a world where machines communicate among themselves and with humans

    stacks in this specific space. This would result in some players creating “universal”
    bots (master bots) which everyone else will use as gateways for their (peripheral)
    interfaces and applications. The good thing of this centralized (and almost monopolistic)
    scenario is, however, that in spite of the two-levels degree of complexity, we
    won’t have the black box issue affecting the deep learning movement today because
    bots (either master or follower) **will communicate between themselves in plain
    English rather than in any programming language.**

    either ***retrieval-based models*** or ***generative-models.*** The first class
    of models uses heuristics to draw answers from predefined responses given some
    inputs and context, while the latter generates new responses from scratch each
    time.

    with deep-q networks (DQNs), deep belief networks (DBN), long short-term memory
    RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Sequence-to-sequence Learning (Sutskever et al.,
    2014), and Tensor Product Representations (for a great overview on speech recognition,

    cognition*, what is preventing us from realizing the perfect social bots? Well,
    there are at least a couple of things I can think of.

    created a “Neural Machine Translation”, a relevant leap ahead in the field, with
    the new version even enabling ***zero-short translation*** (in languages which
    they were not trained for).

    We might need to put further effort into Unsupervised Learning, and eventually
    even better integrate the symbolic and neural representations.

    not able to fully embed into a machine yet. MetaMind is doing a great work in
    the space and it recently introduced [**Joint Many-Tasks**](http://metamind.io/research/multiple-different-natural-language-processing-tasks-in-a-single-deep-model/)
    (JMT) and the [**Dynamic Coattention Network**](http://metamind.io/research/state-of-the-art-deep-learning-model-for-question-answering/)
    (DCN), respectively an **end-to-end trainable** model which allows collaboration
    between different layers and a network that reads through documents having [*an
    internal representation of the documents conditioned on the question that it is
    trying to answer*](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2016/12/06/major-advancements-deep-learning-2016/).

    either lacking *personality* or completely missing the *spatiotemporal context.*
    These are two essential aspects for a general CUI, and only a few works have been
    tried up to date (Yao et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016).
