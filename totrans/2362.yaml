    adopting this technology to handle their everyday tasks. Machine learning practitioners
    may be able to present the solution but enhancing the model performance can be
    very challenging at times. It is something that comes with practice and experience.
    Even after trying out all the strategies, we often fail to improve the accuracy
    of the model. Therefore, this article is intended to help beginners improve their
    model structure by listing the best practices recommended by machine learning
    Experts.

    Both the quality and the quantity of the data can lead to stronger model performance.
    It''s often time taking and more complex than crafting the machine learning models
    themselves. This step is often referred to as data preparation. It can be further
    classified into the following steps:'

    to get an in-depth knowledge of the underlying problem that you are trying to
    solve. Categorize your problem into classification, regression, clustering or
    recommendation, etc. This simple segmentation can help you collect the relevant
    dataset that is most suitable for your scenario.'

    suggests, it is the collection of historic data to find recurring patterns. It

    (photos, videos, etc). Some of the famous sources to borrow your dataset are:'

    You have to perform various tasks like spotting the outliers, identifying the
    data distribution and relationship between the features, looking out for inconsistent
    and missing values, etc. **Microsoft Excel** is a popular manual tool used for

    data transformation.  Feature engineering involves infusing new features into
    your model from features that are already available. It can help us identify the
    robust features and remove the correlated or redundant ones. However, it requires
    domain expertise and may not be feasible if our initial baseline already includes
    a diverse set of features. Let''s understand it from an example. Consider that
    you have a dataset containing the length, width, and price of the house as follows:'

    “Area” and measure only the impact of that variable on the Price of the house.
    This process falls under the category of **Feature Creation.**

    depending on our project domain. Feature Transformation involves applying the
    transformation function on a feature for a better visualization while in Feature
    Extraction, we compress the amount of data by only extracting the relevant features.

- en: 'Although, **Feature Scaling** is also a part of Feature Engineering I have
    discussed it separately to focus on its importance. Feature Scaling is the method
    used to normalize the range of independent variables and features. **Why is this
    step so important?** Most algorithms like linear regressions, logistic regression,
    and neural networks make use of gradient descent as an optimization technique.
    Gradient descent heavily depends upon the range of features to determine the step
    size towards the minima but most of our data vary drastically in terms of ranges.
    This thing compels us to normalize or standardize our data before feeding it into
    the model. The two most important techniques in this regard are:'

    typically between ranges [0,1] but you can also define your range [a,b] where
    a and b are real numbers.'

    of 0 and a variance of 1\. We first calculate the standard deviation and mean
    of the feature and then calculate the new value using this formula:'

- en: There has been a lot of debate to determine which one is better and some findings
    showed that for a gaussian distribution, standardization was more helpful as it
    was not affected by the presence of outliers and vice versa. But, it depends upon
    the type of problem that you are working on. Hence, it's highly recommended to
    test both and compare performance to figure out what works best for you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You might have encountered a situation when your machine learning models perform
    exceptionally well on your training data but fails to perform well on the test
    data. This happens when your model is **overfitting** your training data. Although
    there are a lot of methods to combat overfitting like dropping out layers, reducing
    the network capacity, Early stopping, etc but regularization outperforms all.
    **What exactly is Regularization?** Regularization is a technique that prevents
    overfitting by shrinking the coefficients. This results in a simplified model
    that performs more efficiently while making predictions. There are two types of
    regularization:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**L1 Regularization** **-** It is also known as Lasso Regression. It forces
    some of the coefficients estimates to exactly become zero by adding a penalty
    to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. It forms a sparse model
    and is useful for feature selection.'

- en: '**L2 Regularization** **-** It is also known as Ridge Regression. It penalizes
    the model by adding the square of the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients.
    Hence, it forces the coefficients to have a value close to zero but not exactly
    zero. It improves the interpretability of the model.'

- en: Although L2 regularization gives a more accurate prediction than L1 it comes
    at the cost of computational power. L2 may not be the best choice in case of outliers
    as the cost increases exponentially due to the presence of a square. Hence, L1
    is more robust as compared to L2.

    itself and are set before the learning process begins e.g learning_rate (alpha),mini-batch
    size, No of layers, No of hidden units, etc. **Hyperparameter tuning** refers
    to the process of selecting the most optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm
    that minimizes the loss function. In a simpler network, we experiment on separate
    versions of the model and with different combinations of the hyperparameters but
    this may not be the suitable option for the more complex networks. In that case,
    we make the optimal selection based on prior knowledge. Some of the widely used
    hyperparameter tuning methods to make an appropriate selection from the range
    of a hyperparameter space are as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Grid Search** **-** It is the traditional and most commonly used method for
    hyperparameter tuning. It involves selecting the best set from the grid containing
    all the possible combinations of hyperparameters. However, it needs more computational
    power and time to perform its operation.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Random Search** **-** Instead of trying every combination, it selects the
    set of values in a random fashion from the grid to find the most optimum ones.
    It saves unnecessary computational power and time as compared to Grid search.
    Since no intelligence is being used, so luck plays a part in it and it yields
    high variance.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Bayesian Search** **-** It is used in applied machine learning and outperforms
    Random Search. It makes use of the **Bayes theorem** and takes into account the
    result of the previous iteration to improve the result of the next one. It needs
    an objective function that minimizes the loss. It works by creating a surrogate
    probability model of the objective function, then finding the best hyperparameters
    for the surrogate model, it is then applied to the original model and updates
    the surrogate model, and estimates the objective function. This process is repeated
    until we find the optimum solution for the original model. It does take less iteration
    but a longer time is required for each iteration.'

    runtime, and maximizing performance. Hence, the ideal method for your case depends
    on your priorities.
