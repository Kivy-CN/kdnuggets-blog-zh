- en: The Alphabet subsidiary DeepMind has done it again, and this time, they are
    testing the boundaries of AI in software development sectors. DeepMind’s [AlphaCode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07814)
    was tested against human performance on coding challenges and achieved rank among
    the **top 54%** of human coders on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). This
    is a remarkable achievement as it is one of its kind. There are other code generation
    machine learning models, such as [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/),
    but none of them tried to compete with human programmers.

    must have an understanding of logic, math, and programming skills.

    surpassed average coders. We will learn how AlphaCode works and discuss the possibility
    of AI replacing human programmers. We will also learn about AI-assisted programming
    and how it is shaping the future.

- en: In simple words, the AplhaCode reads structured problem statements and generates
    the best possible solution. It was only possible due to large-scale transformers,
    which have shown promising results in code generations. These transformers were
    pre-trained on **175 GB** of data from GitHub and later fine-tuned on small competitive
    programming data - [Tech Monitor](https://techmonitor.ai/technology/ai-and-automation/deepmind-alphacode-ai-software-developer).

- en: The AplhaCode reads the problem statement and comes up with thousands of potential
    solutions. These solutions are passed through a filtering process that reduces
    potential results to ten. Later, these results are submitted to a coding contest
    to evaluate results. The drawback of coming up with thousands of solutions and
    filtering down to ten is curating a large complex programming dataset if we want
    AlphaCode to solve more complex problems.

    Codeforces platform. It was placed among the top **28%** of users who have competed
    on the site in the last six months. It is quite an achievement for the initial
    release. The DeepMind team says that AlphaCode is limited to a competitive programming
    domain, and they are expanding the domain to make its programming accessible and
    fully automated - [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce).

    is a useful contribution to AI research, but it is far from reaching the skilled
    level of a human programmer.

    can cause serious damage to companies. In the [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293),
    researchers found that **40%** of GitHub’s [Copilot-generated](https://copilot.github.com/)
    code contained security vulnerabilities. Even if we somehow resolve this issue
    by cleaning the dataset. We are not ready for bad actors trying to push faulty
    code on the internet, which might be used to train AI models. There is no secure
    AI development without humans in the loop, so we will always need software developers
    and engineers to monitor the progress.

- en: Even if we were able to resolve all the issues I mentioned above, real-world
    software development is quite different from coding challenges. In software development
    the requirement for a project is vague, and you improve the initial idea with
    incremental iterations. It’s a back and forth negotiation between programmer and
    stakeholder. There are no inputs and outputs, you need to figure out outputs with
    every iteration. It’s hard to write all the requirements of stakeholders in a
    structured form, so AlphaCode is just an experiment, not a real threat to humans.

    The GitHub Copilot is assisting developers by auto-completing the code, and sometimes
    it learns from your coding practice and comes up with personalized solutions that
    can automate a lot of software development. The future of AlphaCode is to assist
    coders and non-coders. The main mission is to make repeated tasks automated and
    allow software development hassle-free for both programmers and non-technical
    individuals. Recently, we have seen a rise in no-code or few-code software development,
    and this is just the start. These AI programs won’t replace humans but make us
    better at creating software solutions.

    an intelligent bot, which remembers past conversations and talks like a human.
    The [SalesForce CodeGen](https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/codegen/) mimics
    real-life software development, where you write a prompt and then see the results.
    With every iteration, we are adding and removing things, and AI is constantly
    improving the initial code. For example, **Prompt 1**: “Solve the two sum problem”
    and **Prompt 2**: “Solve the problem using a hash map”. The final code is generated
    by understanding the previous input sequence. In this way, we are evolving our
    code to add new features and remove the existing bug.'
