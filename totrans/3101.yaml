    analysis, which is precisely what we were discussing in our previous article –
    [The What, Where and How of Data for Data Science](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/what-where-how-data-science.html).

    prepared and insights – extracted from them – this information becomes the basis
    for predicting future values. And the accuracy of these predictions lies in the
    methods used.

    forecasting – linear regression analysis, logistic regression analysis, clustering,
    factor analysis, and time series. The output of each of these feeds into the more
    sophisticated machine learning analytics, but let’s first review them individually.

- en: In data science, the linear regression model is used for quantifying causal
    relationships among the different variables included in the analysis. Like the
    relationship between house prices, the size of the house, the neighborhood, and
    the year built. The model calculates coefficients with which you can predict the
    price of a new house, if you have the relevant information available.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since it's not possible to express all relationships between variables as linear,
    data science makes use of methods like the logistic regression to create non-linear
    models. Logistic regression operates with 0s and 1s. Companies apply logistic
    regression algorithms to filter job candidates during their screening process,
    for instance. If the algorithm estimates that the probability that a prospective
    candidate will perform well in the company within a year is above 50%, it would
    predict 1, or a successful application. Otherwise, it will predict 0.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the data form groups according to some criteria. Cluster analysis takes into account
    that some observations exhibit similarities, and facilitates the discovery of
    new significant predictors, ones that were not part of the original conceptualization
    of the data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If clustering is about grouping observations together, factor analysis is about
    grouping features together. Data science resorts to using factor analysis to reduce
    the dimensionality of a problem. For example, if in a 100-item questionnaire each
    10 questions pertain to a single general attitude, factor analysis will identify
    these 10 factors, which can then be used for a regression that will deliver a
    more interpretable prediction. A lot of the techniques in data science are integrated
    like this.

    the attitudes of customers towards that product. Analysing the results after the
    BI team has generated their dashboards includes grouping the observations into
    segments (e.g. regions), and then analyzing each segment separately to extract
    meaningful predictive coefficients. The results of these operations often corroborate
    the conclusion that the product needs slight but significantly different adjustments
    in each segment in order to maximize customer satisfaction.

    been gathered until a certain date, and the data scientist wants to know what
    is likely to happen in the next sales period, or a year ahead. They apply mathematical
    and statistical models and run multiple simulations; these simulations provide
    the analyst with future scenarios. This is at the core of data science, because
    based on these scenarios, the company can make better predictions and implement
    adequate strategies.

    techniques is the fact that at its core resides the algorithm. These are the directions
    a computer uses to find a model that fits the data as well as possible. The difference
    between machine learning and traditional data science methods is that we do not
    give the computer instructions on how to find the model; it takes the algorithm
    and uses its directions to learn on its own how to find said model. Unlike in
    traditional data science, machine learning needs little human involvement. In
    fact, machine learning, especially deep learning algorithms are so complicated,
    that humans cannot genuinely understand what is happening “inside”.

    regression is the basis of many other methods, including deep neural networks.

    science resorts to using unsupervised learning. This consists of giving the machine

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to see, to read), instead of accuracy. Whenever the machine performs better than
    it has before, it receives a reward, but if it performs sub-optimally, the optimization
    algorithms do not adjust the computation. Think of a puppy learning commands.
    If it follows the command, it gets a treat; if it doesn’t follow the command,
    the treat doesn’t come. Because treats are tasty, the dog will gradually improve
    in following commands. That said, instead of minimizing an error, reinforcement
    learning maximizes a reward.
