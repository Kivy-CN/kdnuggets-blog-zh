    to get started? I faced the same confusion that what should be a good start? Should
    I learn Python or go for R? Mathematics was always a scary part for me, and I
    was always worried that from where should I learn math? I was also worried about
    how I should get a strong basis for Machine Learning. Anyway, you should be congratulated
    that at least you have made your mind.

- en: The very 1st step is that you should learn programming and most probably Python.
    If you have never written a single line of code, then I will recommend you is
    CS50 by Harvard University, the best course for beginners in programming, it will
    teach you from scratch all the C Language and a lot of Python and JavaScript with
    basics of SQL and JSON. This very exciting course is free at edx.org, and you
    can find it [here](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).
    Read an article about cs50 [here](https://blog.usejournal.com/a-novices-guide-to-learning-to-code-with-cs50-d55a050fc57c).

    Introduction to Computer Science with Python available on edX for [free](https://www.edx.org/course/6-00-1x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-3).
    Notice that high school algebra is a prereq for this course because they will
    make you solve a lot of real-world mathematical problems.

    problem solver in programming, I’ll recommend this course by Microsoft, which
    is all related to Computational Thinking available on edx all for [free](https://www.edx.org/course/logic-and-computational-thinking-4).
    This course is really cool and teaches a lot of computational logic and critical

    certainly it helps a lot. I will suggest this course, which teaches you the basics
    of OOP and algorithms in python. You can find this course for [free](https://www.edx.org/course/computing-in-python-iv-objects-algorithms-2) at
