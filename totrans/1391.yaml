    a couple aspects of people’s journeys to their perceived data science success
    are often hidden from view. This blog is meant to show that most everyone has
    had to expend quite a bit of effort to get where they are. They have to work hard,
    sometimes experience failure, show discipline, be persistent, be dedicated to
    their goals, and sometimes sacrifice or take risks. With that, let’s get started!

    it is to get into a top PhD program for AI (usually computer science departments).
    Essentially with all the professors he talked to, he was told he needed “1–2 publications
    in top ML venues” to get into a top phd program. He spent 7 months straight working
    on a research project without funding and without a supervisor in order to produce
    work that could be publishable.
