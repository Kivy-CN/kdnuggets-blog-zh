    high-quality labeled datasets. However, collecting enough high-quality labeled
    data can be a significant challenge, especially in situations where privacy and
    data availability are major concerns. Fortunately, this problem can be mitigated
    with synthetic data. Synthetic data is data that is artificially generated rather
    than collected from real-world events. This data can either augment real data
    or can be used in place of real data. It can be created in several ways including
    through the use of statistics, data augmentation/computer-generated imagery (CGI),
    or generative AI depending on the use case. In this post, we will go over:'

    incorporating electronic health records (EHR) into machine learning applications
    could enhance patient outcomes, doing so while adhering to patient privacy regulations
    like HIPAA is difficult. Even techniques to anonymize data aren’t perfect. In
    response, researchers at Google came up with EHR-Safe which is a framework for
    generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic EHR.

    applications like self-driving cars is that they are physical applications of
    machine learning. An unsafe model can’t be deployed in the real world and causes
    a crash due to a lack of relevant data. Augmenting a dataset with synthetic data
    can help models avoid these problems.

    However, each image should be labeled by expert clinicians, which is a time-consuming

    data can address this by generating large volumes of labeled images without requiring

    as optical flow, is challenging with real-world data. Real data labeling can only
    be done using LiDAR information to estimate object motion, whether dynamic or
    static, from the autonomous vehicle’s trajectory. Because LiDAR scans are sparse,
    the very few public optical flow datasets are also sparse. This is one reason
    why some optical flow synthetic data has been shown to greatly improve performance
    on optical flow tasks.

    could be rare diseases in medical images or usual animals and jaywalkers in self-driving.
    It is also important to consider what edge cases are NOT in a dataset. If a model
    needs to identify an edge case not present in the dataset, additional data collection
    or synthetic data generation might be necessary.

    data. This is why there are model validation procedures like [train test split](https://builtin.com/data-science/train-test-split).
    When augmenting a real dataset with synthetic data, data might need to be balanced
    based on rare classes. For example, in self-driving applications, a machine learning
    practitioner might be interested in using synthetic data to focus on specific
    edge cases like jaywalkers. The original train test split may not have been split
    by the number of jaywalkers. In this case, it might make sense to move a lot of
    the existing jaywalker samples over to the test set to ensure that improvement
    by synthetic data is measurable.

    classes and edge cases. Also, when more rare classes and edge cases are discovered,

    and variability of the original data set. Statistical methods work best when the
    dataset is relatively simple and the relationships between variables are well
    understood and can be defined mathematically. For example, if real data has a
    normal distribution like human heights, synthetic data can be created using the
    same mean and standard deviation of the original dataset.

    modifying existing data to create synthetic data. Data augmentation is widely
    used in image processing. This might mean flipping images, cropping them, or adjusting
    brightness. Just make sure that the data augmentation strategy makes sense for
    the project of interest. For example, for self-driving applications, rotating
    an image by 180 degrees so that the road is at the top of the image and the sky
    at the bottom doesn’t make sense.

- en: A commonly used generative model to create synthetic data is Generative Adversarial
    Networks or GANs for short. GANs consist of two networks, a generator, and a discriminator,
    that are trained simultaneously. The generator creates new examples, and the discriminator
    attempts to differentiate between real and generated examples. The models learn
    together, with the generator improving its ability to create realistic data, and
    the discriminator becoming more skilled at detecting synthetic data. If you would
    like to try implementing a GAN with PyTorch, [check out this TDS blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-ai-synthetic-data-generation-with-gans-using-pytorch-2e4dde8a17dd).
