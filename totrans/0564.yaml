    already a seasoned professional, working at a startup offers a number of advantages.
    Most startups are more hands-on, and usually most employees are involved in many
    aspects of the company. This offers a great opportunity for involvement and the
    expansion of skill sets.

- en: At a larger company, one team might be responsible for Research and Development
    while another team is responsible for Quality Assurance. At a startup, the same
    team might be responsible for all aspects of research, development, and testing.
    As such, startup professionals are exposed to a wider array of experiences because
    they see the big picture and quickly gain the tools needed to become team leaders.

    tips that will help her and other data professionals succeed:'

- en: As a team player, a data scientist should review notebooks not only when called
    for a Code Review, but she should also read [all of](https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/04/rise-data-science-notebooks/)
    [her team’s](https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/04/rise-data-science-notebooks/)
    [notebooks](https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/04/rise-data-science-notebooks/)
    and side notebooks (including ones who might have a differing focus). This ensures
    she gains the fullest understanding of the entire process and how research is
    evolving. Data scientists make a myriad of decisions every day that they’re not
    even aware of. Studying notebooks allows her to reap the benefits of code review
    done by others at the startup.

- en: Embracing the “do-it-yourself” ethos of a startup gives a data scientist the
    opportunity to develop software tools that in a larger company would be developed
    by separate engineering teams. This not only grows one’s skill set, it also makes
    one more self-sufficient, enabling one to troubleshoot and fix problems independently.

    ecosystem working in harmony to create a product or service. This translates into
    the opportunity to be involved in and understand the reasoning behind every aspect
    of a company’s mission.

- en: A Data Scientist can better understand what works with UI by seeking out user
    feedback, if it is available at the startup she is working at. Sometimes users
    might already know what works and what doesn’t so by listening to them it can
    help her decide what features to focus on developing. It’s also important to get
    feedback from teammates about possible blind spots, as their perspective will
    be different, and their vantage points will uncover oversights.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a larger company, after testing a Pull Request, a data scientist job ends.
    At a startup, the same data scientist would go one step further and examine how
    the feature/model is performing live and how her insights are being implemented.
    Data scientists at startups must also pay attention to the live monitors and the
    logs, checking a few of them to spot any irregularities in the first few minutes/hours/days.

    of adaptability, a willingness to improvise, and ability to pivot when needed.
    It also requires the desire to be a part of a tight knit team and see a product
    or service through every stage of development. Though the risk might be high,
    the reward can be great.
