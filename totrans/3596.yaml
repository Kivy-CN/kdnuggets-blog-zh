    applications. As a result, machine learning projects are not well organized, lack
    reproducibility, and are prone to complete failure in the long run. We need a
    model that helps us maintain quality, sustainability, robustness, and cost management
    throughout the ML life cycle.

    the success of machine learning applications. It can be achieved by constant monitoring
    and maintaining the overall system.
