    decisions. One of the reasons for this is that a portfolio is the best way to
    judge someone’s real-world skills. The good news for you is that a portfolio is
    entirely within your control. If you put some work in, you can make a great portfolio
    that companies are impressed by.

    demonstrate 1-2 of the above points. This is the third post in a series that will
    cover how to make a well-rounded data science portfolio. In this post, we’ll cover
    how to make the second project in your portfolio, and how to build an end to end
    machine learning project. At the end, you’ll have a project that shows your ability
    to reason about data, and your technical competence. [Here’s](https://github.com/dataquestio/loan-prediction) the
    completed project if you want to take a look.

    and figure out how to [tell a story with it](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-project/).
    In times like this, it’s important to communicate very well, and walk through
    your process. Tools like Jupyter notebook, which we used in a previous post, are
    very good at helping you do this. The expectation here is that the deliverable
    is a presentation or document summarizing your findings.
  prefs: []

- en: However, there are other times when you’ll be asked to create a project that
    has operational value. A project with operational value directly impacts the day-to-day
    operations of a company, and will be used more than once, and often by multiple
    people. A task like this might be “create an algorithm to forecast our churn rate”,
    or “create a model that can automatically tag our articles”. In cases like this,
    storytelling is less important than technical competence. You need to be able
    to take a dataset, understand it, then create a set of scripts that can process
    that data. It’s often important that these scripts run quickly, and use minimal
    system resources like memory. It’s very common that these scripts will be run
    several times, so the deliverable becomes the scripts themselves, not a presentation.
    The deliverable is often integrated into operational flows, and may even be user-facing.

    multiple files. Using a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/), or an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is
    highly recommended. These tools will allow you to jump between files, and edit
    files of different types, like markdown files, Python files, and csv files. Structuring
    your project so it’s easy to version control and upload to collaborative coding
    tools like [Github](https://github.com/) is also useful.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good dataset for an end to end portfolio project can be hard to find. The
    dataset needs to be sufficiently large that memory and performance constraints
    come into play. It also needs to potentially be operationally useful. For instance, [this
    dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/), which contains data on the admission
    criteria, graduation rates, and graduate future earnings for US colleges would
    be a great dataset to use to tell a story. However, as you think about the dataset,
    it becomes clear that there isn’t enough nuance to build a good end to end project
    with it. For example, you could tell someone their potential future earnings if
    they went to a specific college, but that would be a quick lookup without enough
    nuance to demonstrate technical competence. You could also figure out if colleges
    with higher admissions standards tend to have graduates who earn more, but that
    would be more storytelling than operational.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These memory and performance constraints tend to come into play when you have
    more than a gigabyte of data, and when you have some nuance to what you want to
    predict, which involves running algorithms over the dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good operational dataset enables you to build a set of scripts that transform
    the data, and answer dynamic questions. A good example would be a dataset of stock
    prices. You would be able to predict the prices for the next day, and keep feeding
    new data to the algorithm as the markets closed. This would enable you to make
    trades, and potentially even profit. This wouldn’t be telling a story – it would
    be adding direct value.

    want answered with the dataset, and think if those questions are one-time (“how
    did housing prices correlate with the S&P 500?”), or ongoing (“can you predict
    the stock market?”). The key here is to find questions that are ongoing, and require
    the same code to be run multiple times with different inputs (different data).

    Fannie Mae is a government sponsored enterprise in the US that buys mortgage loans
    from other lenders. It then bundles these loans up into mortgage-backed securities
    and resells them. This enables lenders to make more mortgage loans, and creates
    more liquidity in the market. This theoretically leads to more homeownership,
    and better loan terms. From a borrowers perspective, things stay largely the same,
    though.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fannie Mae releases two types of data – data on loans it acquires, and data
    on how those loans perform over time. In the ideal case, someone borrows money
    from a lender, then repays the loan until the balance is zero. However, some borrowers
    miss multiple payments, which can cause foreclosure. Foreclosure is when the house
    is seized by the bank because mortgage payments cannot be made. Fannie Mae tracks
    which loans have missed payments on them, and which loans needed to be foreclosed
    on. This data is published quarterly, and lags the current date by `1` year. As
    of this writing, the most recent dataset that’s available is from the first quarter
    of `2015`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Acquisition data, which is published when the loan is acquired by Fannie Mae,
    contains information on the borrower, including credit score, and information
    on their loan and home. Performance data, which is published every quarter after
    the loan is acquired, contains information on the payments being made by the borrower,
    and the foreclosure status, if any. A loan that is acquired may have dozens of
    rows in the performance data. A good way to think of this is that the acquisition
    data tells you that Fannie Mae now controls the loan, and the performance data
    contains a series of status updates on the loan. One of the status updates may
    tell us that the loan was foreclosed on during a certain quarter.
