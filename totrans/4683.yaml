- en: If you been following me for a while, you know that me and the [Iron-AI](https://iron-ai.com/) team
    created a library called Optimus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Optimus V2 was created to make data cleaning a breeze. The API was designed
    to be super easy for newcomers and very familiar for people that come from working
    with pandas. Optimus expands the Spark DataFrame functionality, adding `.rows` and `.cols` attributes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Optimus you can clean your data, prepare it, analyze it, create profilers
    and plots, and perform machine learning and deep learning, all in a distributed
    fashion, because on the back-end we have Spark, TensorFlow, Sparkling Water and
    Keras.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s super easy to use. It’s like the evolution of pandas, with a piece of dplyr,
    joined by Keras and Spark. The code you create with Optimus will work on your
    local machine, and with a simple change of masters, it can run on your local cluster
    or in the cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will see a lot of interesting functions created to help with every step
    of the data science cycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Optimus is perfect as a companion for an agile methodology for data science
    because it can help you in almost all the steps of the process, and it can easily
    connect to other libraries and tools.
