    between the variables. You just have to throw in all the data you have, and the
    algorithm processes the data and discovers patterns, using which you can make
    predictions on the new data set. Machine learning treats an algorithm like a black
    box, as long it works. It is generally applied to [high dimensional data sets](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_some_examples_of_high-dimensional_data),
    the more data you have, the more accurate your prediction is.

- en: In contrast, statisticians must understand how the data was collected, statistical
    properties of the estimator (p-value, unbiased estimators), the underlying distribution
    of the population they are studying and the kinds of properties you would expect
    if you did the experiment many times. You need to know precisely what you are
    doing and come up with parameters that will provide the predictive power. Statistical
    modeling techniques are usually applied to low dimensional data sets.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may seem like machine learning and statistical modeling are two different
    branches of predictive modeling. The difference between the two has reduced significantly
    over the past decade. Both the branches have learned from each other a lot and
    will continue to come closer together in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, understanding the association and knowing their differences enables machine
    learners and statisticians to expand their knowledge and even apply methods outside
    their domain of expertise. This is the notion of “data science” itself, which
    aims to bridge the gap. Collaboration and communication between these two fascinating
    data-driven disciplines allows us to make better decisions that will ultimately
    positively affect the way we live.
