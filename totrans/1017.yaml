- en: '*“Given a problem, an algorithm *A* is a set of well-defined instructions that
    run in a finite amount of time and space. It receives an input *I* and returns
    an output *O* that satisfies the constraints of the problem. As an example, a
    problem can be to check whether a number is even. In order to do that, an algorithm
    could be to check whether the number is divisible by 2.”*'
