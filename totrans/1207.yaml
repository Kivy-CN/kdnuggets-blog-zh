    While the [core skills for data scientists](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/09/modern-data-science-skills.html)
    remain largely the same as they have always been – statistics, mathematics, and
    logic – there are always new skill sets emerging. Sometimes, these relate to a
    new paradigm for computer programming or to novel statistical techniques.

    for data scientists](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/09/core-hot-data-science-skills.html)
    are soft skills. Despite what old-school programmers tell you, the truth is that
    today no one, and that includes data scientists, can afford to ignore these skills.
    Not only do they make teamwork more effective – but they can also boost your career.

    skills, let’s take a look at the data. A recent [study by Google](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anantagarwal/2018/10/02/data-reveals-why-the-soft-in-soft-skills-is-a-major-misnomer/#244719f26f7b)
    looked at employees at several major corporations and sought to assess the skills
    possessed by the most productive, innovative employees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The results might come as a surprise. Instead of innovation being driven by
    employees with the highest levels of technical skills, the most productive, creative
    staff members were those involved in interdisciplinary groups. And within these
    groups, it was those individuals with the most highly developed soft skills who
    were able to drive change and were more likely to rise to managerial positions.

- en: As a data scientist, it’s likely that you already pride yourself on an ability
    to communicate complex ideas and data analyses to a general audience. There is
    a case to be made, however, for being able to share your skills and expertise
    outside of the technical requirements of your role. Proactively reaching out to
    both your clients and your managers can not only improve those relationships but
    might even boost your career.

    data related to the topic du jour to a roomful of scientists but another to be
    able to communicate its essence to those who might be able to help with your upwardly
    mobile career aspirations.

    surfing away on her phone, Googling this, that, and everything else. Since the
    idea of online security is drilled into your head daily by the IT department,
    you casually mention that using the world’s favorite search engine is [sort of
    a terrible idea](https://restoreprivacy.com/google-alternatives/) unless you like
    having your every online movement tracked and stored. Conversation ensues. The
    CEO is impressed with your savvy and inclination to help. The next time she’s
    at a board meeting and the C-Suite team is reviewing which employee to elevate
    and which one to ship to Siberia, your name surfaces in her memory as a helpful
    bloke.

- en: Effective, clear, timely decision-making is a crucial skill for business. However,
    it’s often overlooked by data scientists. This can create major problems for companies
    because a data scientist might find themselves in senior positions (see lunchroom
    story above) without the necessary skills and knowledge to make managerial or
    business decisions.
  prefs: []

    and upcoming industry trends can be invaluable in improving your supervisory chops
    and (again) signals that you crave more responsibility.

- en: Critical thinking is a bit more difficult soft skill to define than some of
    the others on this list – and in fact, it is why some liberal art majors spend
    years in college honing this very skill. As scientists, it often seems as though
    the methods we work with leave little room for criticality and creativity. This
    is the opposite of true.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, critical thinking allows you to do two things. One is to efficiently
    filter the tsunami of information we are now bombarded with. With more than [nine
    billion social media users](https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/internet-statistics#post-navigation-2)
    on the top-eight platforms, who could keep up? That’s right. No one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ability to quickly scan and filter information might be the difference-maker
    in your career. Another critical soft skill related to critical thinking is to
    be able to re-frame and re-tool your data analyses on the fly in order to identify
    and address the real problem at hand.

    is that working in teams has always been important to organizations. This is,
    in part, due to research like that I’ve mentioned above, which stresses the value
    of multi-disciplinary teams in driving forward innovation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Working in these environments can be stressful if you’re not a people person
    and don’t have the soft skills necessary to work alongside colleagues who may
    not share your expertise or world views. The ability to build professional relationships
    with colleagues is crucial.
