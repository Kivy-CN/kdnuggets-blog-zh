- en: Recently, I actively started looking for a job change to Data science, I don’t
    have any formal education like Masters or Ph.D. background in AI/Machine Learning.
    I started learning it completely out of my own interest (not just because of hype).
    It was one of the challenging tracks to opt-in especially if you are working simultaneously
    on some other technology. I started my journey by enrolling myself in many MOOCs
    (Massive Open Online Courses) and started reading multiple blogs. Initially, it
    didn’t make sense, eventually after reading other people’s code and getting my
    hands dirty with real-time datasets. It slowly started making sense.

- en: When I started searching for jobs, there began a new interesting story. I opened
    a top job portal in India and started searching for jobs, I found few jobs that
    were relevant to what I was looking for but when I opened one of them, to my surprise
    the requirements they mentioned were something new to me. Leaving traditional
    Data analysis, Machine learning, Deep learning apart, some ETL tools and multiple
    Big Data technologies were mentioned as required skills. I thought It’s okay since
    every company has their own definition of a data scientist these days and opened
    another job. This time it showed up with a requirement of some other technologies
    like AWS, Azure and Power BI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember all these openings were tagged under Data scientist only. All these
    openings have common requirements like Machine learning algorithms, Statistics,
    Data Analysis, Data cleaning and Deep learning techniques. Along with these skills,
    a few companies were expecting the candidates to have knowledge in the cloud (AWS,
    Azure, or GCP) and data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, and ETL tools
    like SSIS. Usually, these technologies are more to do with Data Analyst/Data Engineer
    roles but the Data scientist role is still evolving and doesn’t really stick to
    a particular skillset yet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do understand the fact that companies look for an applicant who fits their
    vacancy and also has the skillset in the technologies they are looking for. This
    will definitely save time and money for the company instead of providing the training
    again.
