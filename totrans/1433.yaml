    random out-of-the-blue statement you may say. But, think about it. A cheetah has
    adapted a very refined approach to hunting by honing its skills through practice,
    observation, experience, and computation.

    and taught continuously until they’re able to operate on their own. The marvelous
    cheetah species too goes through a similar process until it can anticipate the
    escape tactics of various prey and modulate its speed for rapid turns - and not
    just rely on its agility and speed. Cognition is achieved through immense training
    and the core of this process is [Data Labeling](/2019/10/data-labeling-facilitates-ai-models.html).

    be how their recommendation engines work with implicit data. Let’s say a user
    “A” binge-watched a show, say, “Jane the Virgin” (all seasons in 4 days), the
    implicit data is that you liked the show because you obviously sacrificed a lot
    of sleep to watch it. Behavioral data combined with thousands of other data points
    is the basis on which the machine learning algorithm at Netflix actually works.

    they watched a year ago, what they’ve watched recently and what time of day".*

    what people who watched this show watched after, analyzes the trends in the community

    cops, mysterious murders, and more.

    different thumbnail images and annotates them based on the user’s past behavior,
    preference towards a particular genre, filters and lighting, favorite stars, and
    more. This recommendation is unique to every user which is based on thousands
    of similar interests that have helped improve the click-through rates. It’s brilliant

    writing free of grammar errors including spelling, punctuation, and more. Grammarly
    is not all about grammatical errors, it also helps you identify plagiarism, poor
    word choices, slang, tone detection, etc. Grammarly uses a sophisticated artificial
    intelligence system with a team of computation linguists and deep learning engineers
    behind the scenes. The algorithms learn the rules of writing and make suggestions
    by analyzing from research corpora which are a huge collection of labeled text
    for research and development.

    Like how humans get smarter with enriching their knowledge, so do machines! But,
    machines work based on rules. If there is a negation, they report an error. Likewise,
    Grammarly gets smarter with your help (user). Let me take an example of the previous
    line you just read. I thought I had made a mistake seeing a red underline for
    “is”(see below).
  prefs: []

    grammar, writing needs to connect, most importantly your sentences need to read
    well. In this example, I have used “is” because the process goes on and hence
    the present continuous tense. However, Grammarly had other ideas. So, as a user,
    I helped Grammarly label this to better fit the context and ignored the suggestion
    to make it a little smarter.
