    [2018 data science ecosystem](/2018/06/ecosystem-data-science-python-victory.html)),
    we examine which tools were part of the same answer - the skillset of the user.
    We note that this does not necessarily mean that all tools were used together
    on each project, but having knowledge and skills to used both tools X and Y makes
    it more likely that both X and Y were used together on some projects. The results
    we see are consistent with this assumption.

    tools - exactly the same list of 11 tools as last year, although the order has
    changed a little. Keras moved up from n. 10 to n. 8, and Anaconda moved up from
    n. 6 to n. 5\. Tableau and SQL moved down a little.

    very simple measure **Bias_Py_R(X) = with_Py(X) - with_R(X)**, which is positive

    and as we can see, almost every tool is biased towards Python. The only 3 exceptions
    are R (obviously), Microsoft SQL Server, and SAS Base (which is exactly zero bias).
    For comparison, in a [similar 2017 analysis](/2017/06/ecosystem-data-science-machine-learning-software.html)
    there were 10 tools biased towards R and 3 R-biased tools in 2018.
