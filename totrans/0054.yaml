    while your own attempts end up full of glitches and artifacts that make them look
    obviously fake? You've tried tweaking the prompt and settings but still can't
    seem to match the quality you see others producing. What are you doing wrong?

    hyper-realistic human faces using Stable Diffusion. First, we'll cover the fundamentals
    of prompt engineering to help you generate images using the base model. Next,
    we'll explore how upgrading to the Stable Diffusion XL model can significantly
    improve image quality through greater parameters and training. Finally, I'll introduce
    you to a custom model fine-tuned specifically for generating high-quality portraits.

    faces. We will be using the Stable Diffusion version 2.1 demo available on Hugging
    Face Spaces. It is free, and you can start without setting up anything.

    and style of the image. In this case, we want to generate an image of a young
    woman walking on the street. We will be using a generic negative prompt, but you
    can add additional keywords to avoid any repetitive mistakes in the image.

    could be better. You can play around with the prompts, but this is the best you

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will be using the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model to generate high-quality
    images. It achieves this by generating the latent using the base mode and then
    processing it using a refiner to generate detailed and accurate images.

    We will add a negative prompt, set seed, and apply refiner for the best image
    quality.

    of a generic young woman, we will generate the image of a young Indian woman.

    difficulty differentiating between real and synthetic images. This signals a sustainable
    future where anyone can create highly realistic media from simple text prompts
    by leveraging custom models trained on diverse real-world data. The rapid progress
    implies exciting potential - perhaps one day, generating a photorealistic video
    replicating your own likeness and speech patterns may be as simple as typing out
    a descriptive prompt.
