    University (MLU) Computer Vision class. Our mission is to make Machine Learning
    accessible to everyone. We have courses available across many topics of machine
    learning and believe knowledge of ML can be a key enabler for success. This class
    is designed to help you get started with Computer Vision, learn about widely used
    Machine Learning techniques and apply them to real-world problems.

    Amazon has done the community a service by opening their Machine Learning University
    courses to the public, and between the Accelerated Computer Vision course and
    the other currently available offerings, it appears that those wishing to learn
    machine learning from a world class machine learning organization now have another
    option.
