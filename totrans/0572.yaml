    you might end up thinking that bagging a data science job is a walk in the park.

- en: Getting certified in data science or participating in Kaggle competitions is
    not enough to land you a job in this industry. You might have cultivated the skills
    of the trade but there’s no point being exceptionally skilled if you fail at demonstrating
    the same qualities on paper.

  prefs: []

    killer data science resume and land that dream job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    you forgot to add your name at the top?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    why we thought to put it out there before we discuss the specifics of a data science
    resume.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to write ‘CV’ or ‘Resume’ on the top since the nature of the document is evident.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that’s not it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a data scientist, you are driving a revolution. In addition to these basic
    details, feel free to add your portfolio or other public details spanning LinkedIn,
    GitHub, Kaggle, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Only do that if it’ll add value to your profile. If you’re linking to an empty
    LinkedIn profile or a GitHub account that was last updated months ago, there’s
    no point. If there are significant achievements on GitHub, Kaggle or any other
    public platform, feel free to mention the same in a separate section in your resume.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, doing that only makes sense if your work-ex section lacks concrete
    content around data science. If your work-ex itself is a testament to your skills,
    you don’t need to put additional focus on these achievements to validate the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you’re transitioning to data science, correctly showcasing these achievements
    will play a huge role in getting that coveted shortlist.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First off, understand that not many people have a profile title on their resume.
    So, adding the same will go a long way in overshadowing your competition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But before we continue, what’s a profile (or job) title anyway?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is nothing but an identification marker right below your name that communicates
    your professional identity. The recruiters shouldn’t have to scan your work-ex
    to gauge whether you’re relevant to them. You’re adding a job title to make their
    job easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the career stage you are in:'

    but you don’t have any work experience yet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on your resume.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    if you don’t have the professional experience yet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have the relevant work experience
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    such cases, simply mention your current designation as the job title below your
    name.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say you are working as a Data Analyst and your target profile is that
    of a Data Engineer. Don’t try to fool the recruiter and write “Data Engineer”
    as your job title. Sticking to the truth is the only sustainable way to get what
    you want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are transitioning to data science from a related (or unrelated) domain
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In case you are transitioning to data science, mention your current/last-held
    designation. In case you’re transitioning, you need to convince the recruiter
    that you’re serious about data science, even though you don’t have any relevant
    work-ex.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have any certifications to help your cause, we already covered that in
    the first point. If you don’t have that, you can mention your projects or competitions
    in the relevant section. In that case, the job title can turn into something along
    the lines of “<current designation> & Data Science Enthusiast”.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A summary would be a brief 3-4-line statement describing the impact you can
    deliver in the next organization. Don’t go heavy with your data science skills
    here - that’s what the rest of the resume is for. In summary, simply mention the
    value you can deliver using your specific skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    familiar with. Mention the business impact you can deliver: sound decision making,
    improved processes, leadership support, etc.'
