    position and size of this window, you perform calculations or transformations
    on your data. That's essentially what SQL window functions do. They handle tasks
    like computation of running totals, averages, or rankings, which are challenging
    to perform using standard SQL commands.

    function, specifically the `DENSE_RANK()` function. This function is a godsend
    for data analysts, allowing us to rank different rows of data without any gaps.
    Whether you're diving into sales figures, website traffic data, or even a simple
    list of student test scores, `DENSE_RANK()` is indispensable.

    it with its close siblings `RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()`, and showcasing how to
    avoid common pitfalls that might trip you up in your SQL journey. Ready to level

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ranking functions in SQL are a subset of window functions that assign a unique
    rank to each row within a result set. These rank values correspond to a specific
    order, determined by the ORDER BY clause within the function. Ranking functions
    are a mainstay of SQL, used extensively in data analysis for diverse tasks, such
    as finding the top salesperson, identifying the best-performing web page, or determining
    the highest grossing film for a particular year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are three principal ranking functions in SQL, namely `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`,
    and `DENSE_RANK()`. Each of these functions operates slightly differently, but
    they all serve the common purpose of ranking data based on specified conditions.
    `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` functions have similar behavior in that they assign
    the same rank to rows with identical values. The crucial difference lies in how
    they handle the subsequent rank. `RANK()` skips the next rank whereas `DENSE_RANK()`
    does not.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, the [`ROW_NUMBER()`](/sql-group-by-and-partition-by-scenarios-when-and-how-to-combine-data-in-data-science)
    function assigns a unique row number to each row disregarding whether the order
    by column values are identical. While `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()`
    might seem interchangeable at a glance, understanding their nuances is pivotal
    to effective data analysis in SQL. The choice between these functions can significantly
    impact your results and the insights derived from your data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`DENSE_RANK()` is a potent ranking function in SQL that assigns a unique rank
    value within a specified partition. In crux, `DENSE_RANK()` gives non-gap rankings
    for your data, meaning each unique value is given a distinct rank, and identical
    values receive the same rank. Unlike its counterpart `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
    does not skip any ranks if there is a tie between the values.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To break it down, let's visualize a scenario where you have a dataset of student
    scores, and three students have secured the same score, say, 85 marks. Using `RANK()`,
    all three students will receive a rank of 1, but the next best score will be ranked
    4, skipping ranks 2 and 3\. However, `DENSE_RANK()` handles this differently.
    It will assign a rank of 1 to all three students, and the next best score will
    receive a rank of 2, ensuring there is no gap in the ranking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, when should one use `DENSE_RANK()`? It's particularly handy in scenarios
    where you require continuous ranking without any gaps. Consider a use case where
    you need to award the top three performers. If you have ties in your data, using
    `RANK()` might lead you to miss out on awarding a deserving candidate. That's
    when `DENSE_RANK()` comes to the rescue, ensuring all top scorers get their due
    recognition, and the ranks are not skipped.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding the differences between `DENSE_RANK()`, `RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()`
    is essential for efficient data analysis in SQL. All three functions are powerful
    in their right, but their subtle differences can significantly impact the outcome
    of your data analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with `RANK()`. This function assigns a unique rank to each distinct
    value within a data set, with the same rank assigned to identical values. However,
    when `RANK()` encounters a tie (identical values), it skips the next rank(s) in
    the sequence. For instance, if you have three products with the same sales figures,
    `RANK()` will assign the same rank to each of these products but will then skip
    the next rank. This means that if these three products are the best-selling products,
    they will all be assigned rank 1, but the next best-selling product will be assigned
    rank 4, not rank 2.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, let's consider `DENSE_RANK()`. Similar to `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()` assigns
    the same rank to identical values, but it does not skip any ranks. Using the previous
    example, with `DENSE_RANK()`, the three best-selling products would still be assigned
    rank 1, but the next best-selling product would be assigned rank 2, not rank 4.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, `ROW_NUMBER()` takes a different approach. It assigns a unique rank
    to every row, regardless of whether the values are identical. This means even
    if three products have the same sales figures, `ROW_NUMBER()` will assign a unique
    number to each, making it perfect for situations where you need to assign a distinct
    identifier to each row.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The syntax of `DENSE_RANK()` is straightforward. It''s used in conjunction
    with the `OVER()` clause, partitioning the data before assigning ranks. The syntax
    is as follows: `DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column)`. Here, `column` refers to
    the column by which you want to rank your data. Let''s consider an example where
    we have a table named `Sales` with columns `SalesPerson` and `SalesFigures`. To
    rank the salespeople by their sales figures, we would use the `DENSE_RANK()` function
    as follows: `DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SalesFigures DESC)`. This SQL query will
    rank the salespeople from highest to lowest based on their sales figures.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using `DENSE_RANK()` in conjunction with `PARTITION BY` can be particularly
    insightful. For instance, if you want to rank salespeople within each region,
    you can partition your data by `Region` and then rank within each partition. The
    syntax for this would be `DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY SalesFigures
    DESC)`. This way, you are not just getting a comprehensive ranking but also a
    nuanced understanding of performance within each region.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While `DENSE_RANK()` is a highly useful function in SQL, it’s not uncommon for
    analysts, especially those new to SQL, to make mistakes when using it. Let’s take
    a closer look at some of these common errors and how to avoid them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One common mistake is misunderstanding how `DENSE_RANK()` handles null values.
    Unlike some SQL functions, `DENSE_RANK()` treats all NULLs as identical. This
    means that if you are ranking data where some values are NULL, `DENSE_RANK()`
    will assign the same rank to all NULL values. Be mindful of this when working
    with datasets that contain NULL values, and consider replacing NULLs with a value
    that represents their meaning in your context, or excluding them depending on
    your specific requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another frequent error is overlooking the importance of partitioning when using
    `DENSE_RANK()`. The `PARTITION BY` clause allows you to divide your data into
    distinct segments and perform the ranking within these partitions. Neglecting
    to use `PARTITION BY` can lead to erroneous results, particularly when you want
    ranks to restart for different categories or groups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Related to this is the improper use of the `ORDER BY` clause with `DENSE_RANK()`.
    `DENSE_RANK()` assigns ranks in ascending order by default, meaning the smallest
    value gets the rank of 1\. If you need the ranking to be in descending order,
    you must include the `DESC` keyword in your `ORDER BY` clause. Failure to do so
    will produce rankings that might not align with your expectations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, some analysts mistakenly use `DENSE_RANK()` where `ROW_NUMBER()` or
    `RANK()` might be more appropriate, and vice versa. As we have discussed, all
    three of these functions have unique behaviors. Understanding these nuances and
    selecting the correct function for your specific use-case is critical to conducting
    accurate and effective data analysis.

    of data analysis in SQL, particularly where rankings and comparisons are involved.
    This function offers a nuanced approach to ranking, one that maintains a continuity
    in the ranking scale by assigning the same rank to identical values without skipping
    any rank numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is particularly helpful in analyzing large datasets, where data points
    can often share identical values. For instance, in a sales dataset, multiple salespeople
    may have achieved the same sales figures. `DENSE_RANK()` enables a fair ranking,
    where each of these salespeople are assigned the same rank. Additionally, the
    use of `DENSE_RANK()` in conjunction with `PARTITION BY` allows for focused, category-specific
    analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This function's application becomes even more potent when dealing with null
    values. Instead of excluding these from the ranking process, `DENSE_RANK()` treats
    all nulls as identical and assigns them the same ranking. This ensures that even
    though the exact values might be missing, the data points are not ignored, thereby
    providing a more comprehensive analysis.
