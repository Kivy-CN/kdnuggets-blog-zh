    are not coming from a quantitative field. Whether you are a computer science undergrad,
    a developer in seek of a career change or a MBA graduate, it seems that the statistical
    part of data science is often the most intimidating one. As a business school
    graduate, it was for me.

    **As an aspiring data scientist, how should you approach learning stats? What
    do you *need* to know? What’s the best way to learn about stats?** Here’s how
    you should go about this.

- en: You can get tremendous value from understanding simple statistical concepts.
    In many data science projects, you don’t need advanced stats knowledge to draw
    significant conclusions. For this reason, you should *focus on learning the basics
    of statistics*, applying them to your work and expanding from there.
  prefs: []

- en: The two main branches of statistics that you *need* know are descriptive statistics
    and inferential statistics. You can get a ton of value by understanding those
    properly.

- en: Descriptive statistics describe quantitatively a collection of information.
    They summarize the observed data. Contrarily to inferential statistics, they are
    not deducing facts about the greater population. They are *only* describing the
    collected data set.

- en: You have surely interacted with those statistics in the past. Some common measurements
    in descriptive statistics gauge the central tendency *(mean, median, mode…)* and
    others the variability *(standard deviation…)* of the data set.

- en: Inferential statistics enables us to infer properties about a population based
    on a sample data set. They use the sample to form conclusions beyond the collected
    data.

- en: In practical data science, inferential statistics are heavily used when comparing
    conversion rates, analyzing an experiment such as an A/B test, etc.

    a very good way to get started in this field. They will provide you just enough
    knowledge so you can start getting more comfortable with statistics.

    This book by Charles Wheelan covers, amongst others, the topics of descriptive/inferential
    statistics and provides a good overview of each field. It demystifies statistics
    through some very concrete and cheerful examples.'

    to concrete examples. Once you have started to integrate those concepts in your
    analyses, I recommend you pick up a statistics manual, such as [All of Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/0387402721)
    and deepen your knowledge.
