    (as Professor Thomas Davenport and US Chief Data Scientist D.J. Patil declared
    in 2012). Fueled by the data tsunami, we’ve entered a golden age of predictive
    discoveries. A frenzy of analysis churns out a bonanza of colorful, valuable,
    and sometimes surprising insights:[i]

    “An orange used car is least likely to be a lemon.”[ii] This insight came from
    a predictive analytics competition to detect which used cars are bad buys (*lemons*).
    While insights also emerged pertaining to other car attributes—such as make, model,
    year, trim level, and size—the apparent advantage of being orange caught the most
    attention. Responding to quizzical expressions, data wonks offered creative explanations,
    such as the idea that owners who select an unusual car color tend to have more
    of a “connection” to and take better care of their vehicle.'

    Put another way, if you buy a car that’s *not* orange, you increase your risk
    by 50%.

- en: Well-established statistics appeared to back up this “colorful” discovery. A
    formal assessment indicated it was *statistically significant*, meaning that the
    chances were slim this pattern would have appeared only by random chance. It seemed
    safe to assume the finding was sound. To be more specific, a standard mathematical
    test indicated there was less than a 1% chance this trend would show up in the
    data if orange cars weren’t actually more reliable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But something had gone terribly wrong. The “orange car” insight later proved
    inconclusive. The statistical test had been applied in a flawed manner; the press
    had ran with the finding prematurely. As data gets bigger, so does a potential
    pitfall in the application of common, established statistical methods.

    pitfall often dupes even the brightest of data scientists. This hidden hazard
    can undermine the process that evaluates for statistical significance, the gold
    standard of scientific soundness. And what a hazard it is! A bogus discovery can
    spell disaster. You may buy an orange car—or undergo an ineffective medical procedure—for
    no good reason. As the aphorisms tell us, bad information is worse than no information
    at all; misplaced confidence is seldom found again.

- en: This peril seems paradoxical. If data is so valuable, why should we suffer from
    obtaining more and more of it? Statistics has long advised that having more examples
    is better. A longer list of cases provides the means to more scrupulously assess
    a trend. Can you imagine what the downside of more data might be? As you’ll see
    in a moment, it’s a thought-provoking, dramatic plot twist.

    The very notion of empirical discovery is at stake. To leverage the extraordinary
    opportunity of today’s data explosion, we need a surefire way to determine whether
    an observed trend is real, rather than a random artifact of the data. How can
    we reaffirm science’s trustworthy reputation?
  prefs: []

- en: Statistics approaches this challenge in a very particular way. It tells us the
    chances the observed trend could randomly appear even if the effect were not real.
    That is, it answers this question:[iii]

- en: '**Question that statistics can answer:** *If orange cars were actually no more
    reliable than used cars in general, what would be the probability that this strong
    a trend—depicting orange cars as more reliable—would show in data anyway, just
    by random chance?*'

    by Randomness*, as Nassim Taleb titled his compelling book. The book reveals the
    dangerous tendency people have to subscribe to unfounded explanations for their
    own successes and failures, rather than correctly attributing many happenings
    to sheer randomness. The scientific antidote to this failing is probability, which
    Taleb affectionately dubs “a branch of applied skepticism.”

- en: Statistics is the resource we rely on to gauge probability. It answers the orange
    car question above by calculating the probability that what’s been observed in
    data would occur randomly if orange cars actually held no advantage. The calculation
    takes data size into account—in this case, there were 72,983 used cars varying
    across 15 colors, of which 415 were orange.[iv]
