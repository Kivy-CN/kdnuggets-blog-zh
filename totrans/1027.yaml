    do not really depend on the number of years of experience. You can lead the data
    science teams at any age as long as you understand the business objectives and
    align them with the team’s expectations and interests.

    career. It shows that you are able to think long-term and are able to bridge the
    gap between churning models with high accuracy vs building the models that add
    tangible business value. Let us all be honest that the machine learning model
    building process is time and resource expensive and needs a clear understanding
    of the opportunity size and impact of ML models.

    of the model, etc. It takes off a huge load from the business executives and brings
    synergies and trust to the data science team.

    but a data science manager is also tasked with gauging the pulse of the team.
    There is a perception that a data science team gets to work on and with new state-of-the-art
    cutting-edge models all day long. But the reality also includes building automation
    workflows for repeat tasks, working on a proof of concept for 4 months only to
    see it scraped off, model monitoring, and maintenance, explaining model predictions,
    etc. to name a few.

  zh: 如果你已经说服管理层接受了你解决方案的价值主张，但数据科学经理的任务还包括感知团队的脉搏。虽然有一种看法认为数据科学团队整天都在使用最先进的前沿模型，但现实中还包括为重复任务构建自动化工作流程，进行4个月的概念验证却只看到其被废弃，模型监控和维护，解释模型预测等。
- en: The essence is you need to identify the align the interests of your team - some
    may be from a core research background and can think through innovative solutions
    while others might be interested in being a full-stack data scientist aka all-rounder.

  zh: 关键是你需要识别并调整团队成员的兴趣 - 有些可能来自核心研究背景，能够思考创新解决方案，而其他人可能对成为全栈数据科学家，即全能型人才感兴趣。
- en: Always remember that the work that is appearing to be a burden for one of your
    team members (could be because they have done it long enough and aspire to challenge
    themselves with something new) might be a good opportunity to learn and upskill
    for someone else.

  zh: 始终记住，团队中某个成员看来像是一项负担的工作（可能是因为他们已经做了很长时间，并渴望接受新的挑战），可能对其他人来说是一个学习和提升技能的好机会。
- en: Its all about finding the coherence that comes with the often underrated skill
    of knowing your team well. Do not maintain a mechanical aka transactional relationship
    with your team where you are only communicating the tasks and not incorporating
    their expectations from work.

- en: Truth be told - you can not get a team to work for a long time on a task they
    are not interested in. But you still have to finish the task. A good data science
    manager will note the interests of all the team members and should be able to
    truthfully explain the reality. But what's the reality?

- en: You need to be utterly faithful to your commitments with the team as you are
    working with brilliant minds in the industry. You can only onboard them by making
    them understand that the successful completion of current tasks will take them
    a step closer to their areas of interest.

- en: Note that we are not living in an ideal world, so chances are high that you
    might not be able to meet the expectations of the entire team at once. You are

- en: That’s where the concept of emphatic leadership comes from. Your awareness of
    the team’s expectations and willingness to help them accomplish those is a testament
    to your management skills already. The efforts in the right direction are well-recognized
    by the team. Those who are yet to receive their share of the pie also understand
    that given the right time and opportunity, the manager will position and enable
    them to achieve their foreground

    can very well come from their area of interest, rather than forcing them to walk
    in someone else’s footsteps. A good data science manager holds himself accountable
    for the team’s learning curve and promotes some buffer time to explore the work
    of their own interest. Oh, but you might think that your area of interest would
    not necessarily find a business outcome.

    to spend 15-20% of their time exploring the new algorithm, learning a new skill
    like a programming language, etc. Essentially, giving them the wings to think
    outside the boundaries of the pure-play business context.
