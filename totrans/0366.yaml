- en: This first course is an introduction to Generative AI by Dr Gwendolyn Stripling,
    an AI Technical Curriculum Developer at Google Cloud. It will make you learn what
    Generative AI is and how it’s applied. It begins with the basic concepts of data
    science (AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning), and how Generative AI is different
    from these disciplines. Moreover, it explains the key concepts that surround Generative
    AI with very intuitive illustrations, such as transformers, hallucinations and
    Large Language Models.

    is a very important concept behind transformers and Large Language Models. It
    has enabled improving tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization and
    question answering.  In particular, it shows how the attention mechanism works
    to solve the machine translation.

    models that produce text captions by taking images as input. It exploits an encoder-decoder
    structure, attention mechanism and transformer to solve the task of predicting
    a caption for a given image. Like the previous course, there is also a laboratory
    to put the theory into practice. It is again oriented toward data professionals
    with prior knowledge in Python and Tensorflow.

    explaining again what Generative AI is and its use cases, such as code generation,
    information extraction and virtual assistance. After giving an overview of these
    core concepts, Google Cloud shows the tools that help on solving Generative AI
    tasks even without an AI background. One of these tools is Vertex AI, which is
    a platform that enables to manage the machine learning cycle, from building to
    the deployment of the machine model.  This end-to-end platform includes two products,
    Generative AI Studio and Model Garden. The course is focused on explaining Generative
    AI Studio,  which allows to build easily generative models with no code or low
    code.
