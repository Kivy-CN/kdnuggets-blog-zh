    teams for 10+ years, her teams won awards for their work, presents actively at
    conferences, and has a PhD in industrial engineering from a top program? Of course!
    But would it give you pause if she didn’t have significant hands-on experience
    with tools/techniques like deep learning, Kubernetes, and Tensorflow? It shouldn’t,
    but this job requirement persists in many job postings for senior data science
    leaders, so let me explain who is fit to lead teams and why experience with the
    latest toys should not be top of the list.

- en: A few months ago, I spoke with the professional colleague who I just described
    above because she was on the market after years of leading teams for a Fortune
    100 company in an industry that competes heavily on analytics and data science.
    She was lamenting that so many job descriptions want "hands-on" experience with
    the latest tools. I’ve long seen this gap between what is needed and what so many
    job postings demand, so I [wrote about it on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pollymitchellguthrie_datascience-analytics-leadingpeople-activity-6714682863381573632-uA-c/).
    The post stimulated significant discussion, so I decided it was worth expanded
    commentary.

    to maximize results from your data science teams, please hire people who are good
    at leading people and have experience delivering results with data science. Stop
    insisting on years of hands-on experience with the latest tools and techniques,
    which they won’t touch themselves once they get hired. Instead, value the skills
    they will actually need, which are far more critical to a team’s success than
    proficiency in GPT-3.'

    how to frame business problems, help data scientists abstract that business problem
    into a technical structure they can model, coach them to explain their results
    to business leaders, considers usability and deployment, and develop careers.
    I view the skills needed in data science like the legs on a stool. Programming
    experience, quantitative rigor, business acumen, and interpersonal skills are
    all essential, but it takes a while for the stool to be balanced. A junior data
    scientist is part of a team, so you can afford for his stool to be wobbly because
    others can compensate for areas where he is weaker. Your leader’s stool needs
    to be balanced, but that balance is the result of skills that developed into steadiness
    over time.
  prefs: []

- en: The balance is illustrated well by an exchange I had years ago with another
    former colleague, Annie Tjetjep, who relates development for data scientists to
    frozen yogurt. She argues that people start with one set of strengths, just like
    the first swirl of frozen yogurt added to the cup. For most junior data scientists,
    the first legs to develop are in programming and quantitative rigor, which they
    learn in university or through online courses and practice. And in spite of the
    fact that [research has shown](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.2018.0955)
    that interest in communication and interpersonal skills dominate ads for data
    scientists more than any other skills, academic programs continue to shortchange
    curriculum in these areas.

    modelling, then business that then improves modelling and creativity, then communication
    that then improves modelling, creativity, business, and programming, but then
    chooses to focus on communication, business, programming and/or modelling - none
    of which can be done credibly in Analytics without having the other dimension.
    The strengths in the dimensions were never equally strong at any given time except
    when they knew nothing or a bit of everything - neither option being very effective
    - who would want one layer of froyo? People evolve unequally, and it takes time
    to develop all skills, and even once you develop them, you may choose not to actively
    retain all of them.” Swirls of additional flavors of yogurt get added, just like
    the data scientist adding to her skill set with experience.

    she’ll need to develop the legs of her stool, focusing on business acumen and
    interpersonal skills. By the time she reaches the director level or higher, she
    hasn’t likely written hands-on code in years, nor should she. She will be busy
    *leading*, which means she is immersed in the company’s business, attracting,
    retaining, and growing talent, identifying where data science can add the most
    value, ensuring data science moves successfully from the lab to production, and
    translating that value to non-technical leaders. Even if she misses hands-on programming
    herself, she won’t have had time to keep up with the latest toys with everything
    else on her plate.

    proficiency with R, SQL, and Python including the Tensorflow, Keras, and XGBoost
    libraries.” This person was also expected to *lead* a “large team of Data Scientists”
    to “enhance the company’s profitability, improve our customers’ experiences, and
    better our ability to measure and manage risk… *extract* valuable business insights,
    *translate* those insights into real-world benefits, and *communicate* the results
    to the executive team...*collaborate* with business domain subject matter experts
    in various departments to *understand* the problem and the objectives.”'

    of things I expect someone at a senior leadership level to be doing, not writing
    code. The leader needs to understand the business value, technical strengths,
    and limitations of Tensorflow, Keras, and XGBoost, but she doesn’t need to gain
    that knowledge by hand. At the senior leadership level, she has spent at least
    the last 5-6 years rising in leadership ranks since the birth of those tools and
    is no longer in the trenches slinging code.

- en: The value of hiring fresh talent out of university is they do have that experience,
    with strength in the quantitative rigor of the latest algorithms like deep learning
    and programming in the packages-du-jour, like GPT-3\. But while the tools will
    change, what recent grads won’t have in-depth, because as noted, even the best,
    most well-rounded programs struggle to teach, is the enduring business acumen
    and interpersonal skills necessary to excel at those verb capabilities like translate,
    communicate, collaborate, and understand.

- en: Those skills are the result of lessons learned, years of listening to business
    users complain about their problems, and translating those symptoms into a properly-framed
    business problem. Junior data scientists may jump into solving their first pass
    at the problem and throwing the fanciest math they know at a solution. Over time
    they will improve at abstracting the problem correctly and choosing the right
    methods (not always the latest) to address it, but they will get there faster
    if led by someone who already learned those lessons. Experience has taught me
    volumes, like finally succeeding at explaining operations research to health care
    leaders who think OR means the operating room or having my team’s models languish
    because we didn’t involve IT soon enough in planning for deployment.

    added to their GitHub repo in the last year. Consulting firm [McKinsey’s list
    of 10 reasons for failures](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/ten-red-flags-signaling-your-analytics-program-will-fail)
    is all about those verbs I emphasized above – lack of a clear vision, insufficient
    understanding of the business value, gap in translation, role ambiguity, team
    isolation, etc. Too many data science projects fail, so let’s set them up to succeed
    by hiring leaders fit to *lead* data science teams, not program for them.
