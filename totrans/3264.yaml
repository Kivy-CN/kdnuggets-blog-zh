    or concepts, or a seasoned ML vet looking for a once-over of an algorithm you
    haven't seen or used in a while, these short and to-the-point tutorials may provide
    the assistance you are looking for. Each of these posts concisely covers a single,
    specific machine learning concept.

- en: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a particular classification strategy. SMVs
    work by transforming the training dataset into a higher dimension, which is then
    inspected for the optimal separation boundary, or boundaries, between classes.
    In SVMs, these boundaries are referred to as hyperplanes, which are identified
    by locating support vectors, or the instances that most essentially define classes,
    and their margins, which are the lines parallel to the hyperplane defined by the
    shortest distance between a hyperplane and its support vectors. Consequently,
    SVMs are able to classify both linear and nonlinear data.

- en: Clustering is used for analyzing data which does not include pre-labeled classes.
    Data instances are grouped together using the concept of maximizing intraclass
    similarity and minimizing the similarity between differing classes. This translates
    to the clustering algorithm identifying and grouping instances which are very
    similar, as opposed to ungrouped instances which are much less-similar to one
    another. As clustering does not require the pre-labeling of classes, it is a form
    of unsupervised learning.

- en: Frequent pattern mining is most easily explained by introducing market basket
    analysis (or affinity analysis), a typical usage for which it is well-known. Market
    basket analysis attempts to identify associations, or patterns, between the various
    items that have been chosen by a particular shopper and placed in their market
    basket, be it real or virtual, and assigns support and confidence measures for
    comparison. The value of this lies in cross-marketing and customer behavior analysis.

- en: As I'm sure you are undoubtedly aware, decision trees are a type of flowchart
    which assist in the decision making process. Internal nodes represent tests on
    particular attributes, while branches exiting nodes represent a single test outcome,
    and leaf nodes represent class labels.

    and easily understandable data classifiers (contrast that with the numerous blackbox
    classifiers in existence).

- en: Linear regression is a simple algebraic tool which attempts to find the “best”
    (generally straight) line fitting 2 or more attributes, with one attribute (**simple**
    linear regression), or a combination of several (**multiple** linear regression),
    being used to predict another, the class attribute. A set of training instances
    is used to compute the linear model, with one attribute, or a set of attributes,
    being plotted against another. The model then attempts to identify where new instances
    would lie on the regression line, given a particular class attribute.
