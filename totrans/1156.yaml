    project. You’re building your project and its infrastructure for other people
    to use it. Because of that, I will not go too much into technical details about
    the infrastructure. What I’ll give you here are recommendations that you should
    have in mind if you want to build a purposeful data science project. That also
    includes some technology suggestions, of course.

    you do that by using real data. By that, I mean data that users produce, the data
    that is updated in real-time, such as streaming data. If you use such data, your
    project becomes less theoretical. You’re working with the data that is relevant
    today, that needs to be updated constantly, which also tests your skills in handling
    such data. This is where the challenge lies, not in practicing on some historical
    data-set even though that has its own purpose too.

    science industry. First of all, building a machine-learning model with static
    data doesn’t make sense. That’s why you’ll (probably) have to know how to use
    APIs. They’ll allow you to automate the data updates. If you use APIs, you can
    avoid creating an integration layer since APIs are also a platform for communication
    between the various systems. If you master APIs, you’ll also be able to deploy
    your model later, even build the application(s) that will use this actual data.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since you’re working with real-time data, it’s advisable that you store the
    data. Otherwise, you’ll have to constantly pull all the data from APIs, including
    the data you already have and new data that appeared in the meantime.
  prefs: []

    data, clean it and append it to the already existing clean data in your database.

    on your own and want to make some relatively serious project on a considerable
    amount of automatically updated real-time data. In that case, the cloud databases
    will allow you to have a relatively cheap way to store such data with virtually
    endless storage capacity. For example, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud also
    offer the possibility of running machine learning algorithms. That’s not something
    you’d be able to do if you used the in-house data storing. And you also won’t
    have to worry about the backups and availability of data.

    huge amounts of data, the chances are you’ll have to be fluent at (or at least
    wanting to learn) cloud computing. The companies are moving to the cloud databases
    for precisely the exact reason why you should do that too. Even if you don’t work
    somewhere as a data scientist yet, it doesn’t mean you couldn’t. Take a look at
    this [guide on how to get a data science job](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-get-a-data-science-job-the-ultimate-guide/);
