    insights and driving smarter decisions with the help of big data. This doesn't
    come as much of a surprise these days -- the ability to gather, categorize, and
    analyze big sets of data is immensely useful when it comes to [making data-driven
    business decisions](/2019/04/psu-make-better-data-driven-business-decisions.html).

    their fair share of errors, and these errors don't do anyone any favors when it
    comes time to analyze data. Whether they're typos, weird naming conventions, or
    redundancies, errors in data sets muddle the accuracy of data analysis.

    hole](https://www.nitorinfotech.com/blog/insights-on-diving-into-data-analytics/),
    you first need to make sure that data cleansing is at the top of your to-do list

    data cleansing is too time-consuming for me to bother with", to which we nod our

    most of them have their fair share of flaws and simply don't work the way you'd
    like them to every time you use them. Algorithms with a bunch of imperfections
    can even ignore data that are essential to your analysis, or they may focus on

    with their data analytics teams don't realize that algorithms and models [aren't
    the same things](https://financetrain.com/difference-between-model-and-algorithm).
    In case YOU weren't aware, either, remember that algorithms are the methods we

    Bias is unfortunately one of the greatest hurdles that need to be overcome when
