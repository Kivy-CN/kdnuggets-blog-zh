- en: AI has taken over the world in recent years and will still be in the next decade.
    Can’t we imagine coming back to life before AI? I hardly think so, as AI has started
    complementing how we live. The breakthrough of AI into everyday life did not happen
    suddenly; instead, it was intentional by some individuals. Many of these individuals
    are what we refer to as the leaders in AI.

- en: Leaders in AI don’t necessarily need to be big CEOs of companies or wealthy
    investors. They could come from any walk of life but still contribute something
    significant to the AI development we still discuss today. These individuals and
    their inspiring stories are what we are going to discuss in this article.

    name often comes up when discussing machine learning or deep learning. As the
    founder of Coursera, which taught millions of individuals, he could be considered
    an inspirational leader in AI and a legend. But, many behind-the-scenes moments
    make him so revered.

    three degrees: Statistics, economics, and computer science. From 1996 to 1998,
    he focuses his research at AT&T Bell Labs on reinforcement learning, feature selection,
    and model selection. His research started to become renowned in 1998 when he built
    an automatically indexed web search engine for machine learning research papers
    on the web.'

    University, where he taught his students data mining, big data, and machine learning.
    At this university, he began advocating for using GPUs in deep learning. This
    approach, though controversial at the time, has since become the standard.

    to provide free learning for everyone. In a similar timeline, he also worked at
    Google, where he founded the Google Brain Deep Learning Project, and worked at
    Baidu until 2017\. After that, he founded Deeplearning.ai as a platform to learn
    deep learning online and a Landing AI startup focusing on providing AI-powered
    SaaS products. Since then, Andrew has focused more on democratizing AI for the
    public.

    As we know, ImageNet is an extensive visual database used for rapidly advancing
    computer vision development, where more than 14 million images have been hand-annotated
    and used widely. From one dataset, it’s developed into an essential part of deep
    learning research.

    honors as an undergraduate with a physics major and studied computer science and
    engineering. Even with high honors, she could still balance her work with her
    work at that time when she came back home every weekend to work at her parent's
    shop.

    professor to full professor at Stanford University. During that time, she also
    worked at Google from 2017 to 2018, where she expressed her opinion about Project
    Maven (Military initiative). She said her principle is about human-centered AI
    to benefit people positively and benevolently.

    Summers), which aims to educate 9th-grade high school girls in AI education and
    research. Since then, it’s evolved to AI4ALL, which aims to increase diversity
    and inclusion in artificial intelligence.

    to her as a "researcher bringing humanity to AI." With all her work, she has gained
    many achievements, notably in 2018 as America's Top 50 Women In Tech by Forbes
    and in 2023 as Time AI100.

    the master at 13\. He also completed his A-and scholarship-level exams at ages
    15 and 16\. With the chess-winning money, he bought himself his first computer
    and self-taught programming.

    His notable achievement is his work as the lead programmer for the game Theme
    Park. In his gaming development career, he established his Elixir Studio studio,
    where he tried to develop a highly ambitious game called Republic: The Revolution
    but has since scope down as the development takes too long. The studio closed
    down in 2005, but many of his experiments for AI simulation in the game inspired
    his works in the future.'

    many of his works on the field of imagination, memory, and amnesia. During this
    time, he also gained a breakthrough in his research that linked the process of
    imagination and episodic memory. These ideas are what he called the simulation
    engine of the mind.

- en: In 2010, he co-founded DeepMind, which aims to combine neuroscience and machine
    learning to achieve AGI. In 2013, the company launched a training algorithm called
    Deep Q-Network that could play ATARI games at a superhuman level using only the
    raw pixels input. In 2014, Google bought DeepMind at £400 million and has since
    launched many breakthrough developments. DeepMind, in the current time, has advanced
    much research in deep learning and reinforcement learning, pioneering deep reinforcement
    learning.
