    and machine learning, face a common problem — they have completed one or two basic
    online course, done some programming lessons, put up a couple of projects on Github,
    and then… then what?

    I discussed, at length, **where you can find MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)
    for jump-starting your journey into data science and machine learning**. That
    article assumed the reader to be a beginner and covers essential MOOCs, which
    are optimized for basic and intermediate learning. You can check that one here,

    inbox, mostly from bright, young professionals, asking similar questions and my
    suggestions about online courses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mostly have a ready answer for those messages. I just send them a list of
    my articles (which, in turn, contains links and references to other highly cited
    articles from KDnuggets or [Team AV](https://medium.com/@analytics)). In most
    cases, I receive happy replies :-)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, since writing those articles, I have personally taken few more ‘advanced’
    courses in AI and machine learning (ML), seen discussions and reviews around few
    more, and naturally felt a need to update those references.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After some thought, I decided it is best to leave the original articles, as
    they really cater to beginners and have served their purpose well for many readers,
    and try compiling a fresh list of online courses.

- en: What do I mean by ‘advanced’ level course?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Advanced’ is a relative term. It is best to have a baseline to explain the word
    in this context. Fortunately, we almost have a gold standard when it comes to
    ML online MOOC — Prof. [Andrew Ng](https://medium.com/@andrewng)’s [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (the
    original one, not the [Deeplearning.ai specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, by ‘advanced’, in this article, I allude to two characteristics,
    which need to be present (not necessarily simultaneously) in the courses that
    will be discussed,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Significantly more breadth than the aforementioned course i.e. covering more
    advanced and diverse topics
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Highly specialized focus related to AI or ML
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I hope I make it clear that my intention is not to say that Prof. Ng’s course
    is a rudimentary one. It is still the best introduction to the world of machine
    learning one can ask for — particularly for beginners. But, after you finish that
    course, do some programming, feel comfortable about the mathematics concepts,
    you should build on your base and learn diverse topics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just hope that this article can help you do that by listing some **free MOOCs**
    with that singular focus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the singular focus for selecting the courses?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI and ML are hot topics and there is no dearth of free online courses covering
    those subjects. Although, I have found that there are a surprisingly little amount
    of true high-quality AI courses out there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, I am in that camp, which firmly believes that [deep learning is not artificial
    intelligence](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/big_data_and_business_intelligence/9781788992893/1/ch01lvl1sec13/some-common-myths-about-deep-learning),
    and therefore reject the notion of any course, having the word “AI” in its title
    but covering nothing more than deep learning frameworks in Python, to be classified
    as an AI course.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, to restrict my listing to a limited number of high-quality courses, I laid
    out some simple ground rule or filters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I tend to **avoid any course with a significant focus on a particular programming
    framework**/tool i.e. no course with a name like “Machine learning with Python…”
    (some examples or code snippets are fine)
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following the same logic, the list will have courses with a **strong emphasis
    on the theoretical foundation **— this mainly favors university courses over those
    offered by individual entrepreneurs or companies (e.g. fast.ai, Google, Microsoft,
    IBM, etc.)
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, I included Udacity courses which are **taught by university faculty
    or renowned researchers** like Sebastian Thrun or Peter Norvig. I did not include
    their nanodegree references, which I do not find intellectually uplifting.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I put included two topics which have enormous importance for true AI learning
    but receive less than usual attention — [**reinforcement learning**](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419)
    and [**game theory**](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-data-scientists-should-know-about-game-theory-types-of-games-2ecc616ea725).
