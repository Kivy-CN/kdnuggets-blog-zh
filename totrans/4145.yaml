    is getting. When I first started coding, when asked what programming language
    I use, and I would reply “Python”. I would get various responses such as ‘Oh cool,
    I need to learn Python’ or ‘I use R, how is Python?’

- en: Python first appeared on the 20th of February 1991\. It was created by Dutch
    programmer Guido van Rossum. The design of Python was heavily emphasized on the
    easy readability of code with the use of significant indentation. The construction
    of the language and object-oriented approach helps new and current programmers
    write clear and understanding code, from small projects to large projects, to
    using small data to big data.
