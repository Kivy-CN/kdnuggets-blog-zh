    there might be several different ways to think around machine intelligence startups
    (e.g., the classification proposed by Bloomberg Beta investor Shivon Zilis in
    2015 is very accurate and useful for this purpose). I believe though that a too
    narrow framework might be counterproductive given the flexibility of the sector
    and the facility of transitioning from one group to another, and so I preferred
    to create a four-major-clusters categorization:'

    highest potential to monetize their products in the short term, but also the less
    defensible. DaaS on the other side is way less replicable, and highly profitable
    anyway. Academic spin-offs are the long bet, which is based on solid scientific
    research that makes them unique but not valuable form day one. Finally, RaaS companies
    are the ones who might face more problems, because of high obsolescence in hardware
    components and difficulties in creating the right interactive interfaces. This
    classification is not intended to rank any business based on how good they are,
    and it does not imply that specific companies belonging to specific classes are
    not going to be profitable or successful (e.g., X.ai is a high profitable company
    with a great product into the RaaS area). It is nothing more than a generalization
    tool useful to look at the sector through the correct lenses.
