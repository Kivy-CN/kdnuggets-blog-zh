    I’ve found there’s a single piece of advice that I catch myself giving over and
    over again to aspiring mentees. And it’s really not what I would have expected
    it to be.

    recommending that they first think about *what kind of data scientist they want
    to be*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason this is crucial is that data science isn’t a single, well-defined
    field, and companies don’t hire generic, jack-of-all-trades “data scientists”,
    but rather individuals with very specialized skill sets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To see why, just imagine that you’re a company trying to hire a data scientist.
    You almost certainly have a fairly well-defined problem in mind that you need
    help with, and that problem is going to require some fairly specific technical
    know-how and subject matter expertise. For example, some companies apply simple
    models to large datasets, some apply complex models to small ones, some need to
    train their models on the fly, and some don’t use (conventional) models at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Each of these calls for a completely different skill set, so it’s especially
    odd that the advice that aspiring data scientists receive tends to be so generic:
    “learn how to use Python, build some classification/regression/clustering projects,
    and start applying for jobs.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those of us who work in the industry bear a lot of the blame for this. We tend
    to lump an excessive number of things into the “data science” bucket in casual
    conversations, blog posts and presentations. Building a robust data pipeline for
    production? That’s a “data science problem.” Inventing a new kind of neural network?
    That’s a “data science problem.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s not good, because it tends to cause aspiring data scientists to lose
    focus on specific problem classes, and instead become jacks of all trades — something
    that can make it harder to get noticed or break through, in a market that’s already
    saturated with generalists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But it’s hard to avoid becoming a generalist if you don’t know which common
    problem classes you could specialize in in the fist place. That’s why I put together
    a list of the five problem classes that are often lumped together under the “data
    science” heading:'

    Gb) datasets stored in .csv or .txt files, it might be hard to understand why
    there would exist people whose full-time jobs it is to build and maintain data
    pipelines. Here are a couple of reasons: 1) A 50 Gb dataset won’t fit in your
    computer’s RAM, so you generally need other ways to feed it into your model, and
    2) that much data can take a ridiculous amount of time to process, and often has
    to be stored redundantly. Managing that storage takes specialized technical know-how.'

    to be a data engineer and/or a data analyst, too. But most jobs will fall more
    neatly into one of these categories than the others — and the larger the company,
    the more these categories will tend to apply.

    be better off building a more focused skillset: don’t learn TensorFlow if you
    want to become a data analyst, and don’t prioritize learning Pyspark if you want
    to become a machine learning researcher.'

    get good at delivering that value. That, more than anything else, is the best
