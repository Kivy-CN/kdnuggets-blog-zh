- en: It can be hard to realize just how much data businesses access on a daily basis
    and how much more they have stored. Many companies have been capturing customer
    data in some form or another for decades. Petabytes of data are traversing networks
    worldwide every day, and all of that data means big money — at least to the companies
    who can analyze and use it properly.

  zh: 数据为何如此有价值
- en: Data has become a valuable commodity, similar to commodities like oil and gold,
    because most companies have similar types of data available to them. But, of course,
    there are also many different types of data, and different data holds different
    value for various companies. Not every company can have the same data strategy
    because the verticals a business needs to explore depend on the domain expertise
    of that business. Still, it is possible to put a value on the data a company owns,
    and those who combine their area of expertise with an ability to capture, analyze,
    and use data are the ones who will create the most value for their organization.

  zh: 数据已经成为一种有价值的商品，类似于石油和黄金等商品，因为大多数公司拥有类似类型的数据。但当然，也存在许多不同类型的数据，而不同的数据对不同的公司具有不同的价值。并非每家公司都可以拥有相同的数据策略，因为企业需要探索的领域取决于该业务的领域专业知识。尽管如此，仍然可以对公司拥有的数据进行评估，那些将其专业领域与捕捉、分析和使用数据的能力相结合的人，将为其组织创造最大的价值。

    be among the world's [most valuable resources](https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2021/07/22/how-has-data-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-commodity/44267/)
    because of how much potential revenue and business value it can provide. Moreover,
    it's available for sale and purchase. Indeed, some of the most influential companies
    globally, like Google and Facebook, have made their money mainly from the valuable
    and often intimate data they have on each of their consumers. The revenue reported
    by these companies, which provide free services to individual consumers, [is staggering.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/microsoft-linkedin-topped-3-billion-in-ad-revenue-in-last-year.html)

- en: Web 1.0 gave us a great mechanism with which to communicate and connect, but
    we couldn’t really effectively navigate through all the information in those days.
    Then came Web 2.0, where platform-based environments like Google, Facebook, and
    YouTube came onto the scene. This simplified data access and exchange between
    the users, but it gave too much control to those organizations. Now, Web 3.0 is
    becoming more mainstream across the world with the rise of cryptocurrencies and
    non-fungible tokens. If you look into the future, 10 years from now, the end-user
    will have more power and control over the data that’s generated because of his
    daily activities, be it on social media, over email, or in the metaverse. Understanding
    what data to capture and how to harness this valuable commodity can spell the
    difference between life and death for the modern company. The most successful
    companies can integrate data from social media, emails, purchasing history, and
    IoT devices to create a very accurate picture of a person. These companies can
    then align their business models and strategies with customer desires to affect
    their outcomes. For example, marketing teams no longer have to send thousands
    of mailers out to potentially uninterested customers.

  zh: Web 1.0为我们提供了一个出色的机制来进行沟通和连接，但那时我们无法有效地浏览所有信息。随后出现了Web 2.0，像谷歌、脸书和YouTube这样的基于平台的环境进入了舞台。这简化了用户之间的数据访问和交换，但也将过多的控制权交给了这些组织。现在，随着加密货币和非同质化代币的兴起，Web
    3.0正在全球范围内变得越来越主流。如果你展望未来，10年后，终端用户将对因日常活动而产生的数据拥有更多的权力和控制，不论是在社交媒体上、通过电子邮件，还是在元宇宙中。了解捕捉哪些数据以及如何利用这种宝贵的商品，可以决定现代公司生死存亡的差异。最成功的公司可以整合来自社交媒体、电子邮件、购买历史和物联网设备的数据，绘制出一个非常准确的人物画像。这些公司可以将其商业模式和策略与客户的需求对齐，以影响他们的结果。例如，营销团队不再需要向潜在的不感兴趣的客户发送成千上万的邮件。

- en: Even though this story is almost a decade old, it perfectly illustrates why
    data is the most valuable commodity for businesses today. Twenty years ago, the
    only data most companies cared about was related to transactions. For example,
    they used data to answer questions like how much their profit margin was, how
    sales affected inventory, and what their costs related to materials and shipping
    were. Along the way, however, companies learned that this data, while necessary,
    was not the key to unlocking revenue growth.

  zh: 尽管这个故事几乎已经过去十年，但它完美地展示了为什么数据是现代企业最有价值的商品。二十年前，大多数公司关注的唯一数据是与交易相关的。例如，他们用数据来回答利润率是多少、销售如何影响库存以及材料和运输的成本是多少等问题。然而，随着时间的推移，公司发现这些数据虽然必要，但并不是解锁收入增长的关键。
- en: The key was in understanding individual consumers, and with advancements in
    AI and computing power, that understanding is becoming ever more fine-tuned. Just
    like Target's amazing ability to know when a woman was pregnant based on her purchases,
    today's data miners can modify advertisements and deliver them across devices
    to the exact person who is most likely to make a purchase. As a result, personalized
    recommendations make sales almost assured.
