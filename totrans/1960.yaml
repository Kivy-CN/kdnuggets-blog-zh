    the best value for money is getting something good for free. But do such things
    exist? Supposedly not, if we go by the saying, “No such thing as a free lunch.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I claim there is a free lunch, and I’m about to prove it! I dug out 10 educational
    ‘free lunches’ – free data engineering courses that also provide quality knowledge. 
    It is true; there’s much more variety and choice if you can or want to pay tens,
    hundreds, sometimes even thousands of dollars.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many such courses are considered free on some other free course lists. Paying
    $90 one-off or $45/month is free to some people. But many people don’t have that
    money for a ‘free’ course, despite being very willing to learn data engineering.
    (Also, let’s get real! Free literally means, well, free! Not ‘cheap’, not ‘very
    little money’, or ‘affordable’. Free!)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From what I researched, these courses really are free. Many are from edX. If
    you choose free access to the course, you must complete it in a certain time,
    usually around six months. But that should be enough to complete every course
    comfortably. Also, free access means you don’t get lifetime access to all the
    materials (they are deleted once you finish) and don’t get a certificate. Despite
    this, you should be able to use these courses to learn about data engineering.

    members and other stakeholders. In doing so, they wrangle data and build and maintain
    data infrastructure, e.g., ETL process, data pipelines, data storage.
