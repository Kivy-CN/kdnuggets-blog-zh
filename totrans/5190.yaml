    stakeholders’ needs unless they are exceptionally well-managed. In contrast, most
    of the successful data analytics projects that I have participated in have been
    small in scope, scale, team size, and timeline. Instead of taking years to complete,
    they typically take days, weeks, or several months and usually meet their end-users’

    Attempting to keep each project’s scale and scope small and limiting the team’s
    size to one to three end-users and one lead data analyst may help projects succeed.
    Teams can add data analysts to complex projects that would benefit from a division
    of labor or complementary skills. For large or complex projects, you may wish
    to assign a project manager to work with the team to identify and manage tasks,
    timelines, risks, and issues. Finally, seek out subject matter experts (SMEs)
