    define data mining as "the application of specific algorithms for extracting patterns
    from data." This demonstrates that, in data mining, the emphasis is on the application
    of algorithms, as opposed to on the algorithms themselves. We can define the relationship
    between machine learning and data mining as follows: data mining is a **process**,
    during which machine learning algorithms are utilized as **tools** to extract
    potentially-valuable patterns held within datasets.'

    science. Before the explosion of the term data science, in fact, data mining enjoyed
    much greater success as a Google search term. Having a look at Google Trends stretching
    back a further 5 years than those shown in the above graphic, data mining was
    once much more popular. Today, however, data mining seems to be split as a concept
    between machine learning and data science itself. If one was to endorse the above
    explanation, that data mining is a *process*, then it makes sense to view data
    science as both a superset of data mining as well as a successor term.

    learning where AI has provided **motivation**, which at times is just as valuable

    branches of mathematics, increasingly borrows from high performance scientific
    computing, all in order to ultimately extract insight from data and use this new-found
