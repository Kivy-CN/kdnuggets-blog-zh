- en: I’ve written before that whether we like it or not, data prep is a major part
    of every data science project. Data preparation consists of tasks to prepare data
    in a repeatable process for use in business analytics, including data acquisition,
    data storage and handling, data cleaning, and early-stages of feature engineering.

    guide will give a sampling of dplyr approaches to each of the steps in data preparation.
    This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of dplyr functions or options, but
    rather a starting point.

- en: A decade ago, R was the only player for data science, but the increased competition
    from Python and SQL have only made it better, as features introduced in one ecosystem
    are quickly copied or ported to another. The broad R user community has a history
    of working make sure their libraries are alive and evolving, ensuring that your
    investment in R will be relevant in another decade. Some day in the future, perhaps
    dplyr, and the Tidyverse, will no longer be the best choice for data prep. But
    for now they make an excellent choice (despite a few awkward syntax elements like
    the %>% pipe!)
