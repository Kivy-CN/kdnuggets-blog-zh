  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data cleaning and wrangling are the processes of transforming raw data into
    a format that can be used for analysis. This involves handling missing values,
    removing duplicates, dealing with inconsistent data, and formatting the data in
    a way that makes it ready for analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cleaning the data usually refers to getting rid of bad/inaccurate values, filling
    in any blanks, finding duplicates, and otherwise making sure your data set is
    as spotless and reliably accurate as can be expected. Wrangling it (or munging
    it, massaging it, or any other weird verb like that) means getting it into an
    analyzable shape. You convert it or map it into another, easier-to-look-at-format.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Warehouses store current and historical data for multiple systems, while databases
    store current data needed to power a project. A database stores the current data
    required to power an application whereas a data warehouse stores current and historical
    data for one or more systems in a predefined and fixed schema to analyze the data.
