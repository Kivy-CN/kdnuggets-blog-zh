- en: 1\. Put In-Demand Skills First
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To save the hiring manager the trouble of looking for your skills, put them
    at the very top of your resume. Be sure to list them in a separate section to
    catch attention.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t use a one-column bullet list for skills. It might take up a lot of resume
    space, so go for something different. If you’re not using any templates where
    the designer took care of space saving, you can simply list them in one sentence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another, more creative way is to differentiate each skill visually, like Upwork,
    a freelance platform, does in its user profiles.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In which order should you list the skills? The best bet is to have those in-demand
    skills first and move on to “least impressive,” if you will. Also, don’t forget
    to provide your evaluation of the skill level, e.g., “beginner, “intermediate,”
    or “expert.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Takeaway**: List your skills close to the top. They will help to draw the
    attention of the hiring manager and let them know if you’re the right candidate
    for the job.'

- en: 2\. Give a Detailed and Concise Overview of Your Achievements
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is another critical section that deserves being in the top half of your
    resume. It is the *“Show, don’t tell”* part that hiring managers want. Before
    asking you to [disclose your flaws during the interview](https://www.fastcompany.com/90213564/your-interviewer-asks-you-to-disclose-your-flaws-what-now),
    they need to be drawn in with strengths.

  prefs: []

    help to students to improve their academic writing skills” sounds impressive,
    but stick to data science-related accomplishments'

    much better, e.g., “*Analyzed marketing processes with custom machine learning
    algorithms to generate $2,000 in savings*” is more impressive with numbers'
  prefs:

    point list. While it’s important to mention them, don’t just leave it like that.

    to get to the interview, which in turn means they might not be qualified.
