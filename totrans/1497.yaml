    — as has the entire MCU for quite a while — and their role in saving nothing less
    than the entire universe (or half of it, anyways), the practice of data science
    actually also has something to learn from their powers. I know you don't believe
    me, but let's take a look.

    reality, we have to understand it. This seems to be a good (enough) analogy for
    the importance of domain knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Setting off on a data science project without an understanding of the project's
    domain is not only a bad idea, the end result likely won't be rooted in reality.
    We don't allow otherwise competent athletes who have never learned the rules of
    baseball to play professional baseball; likewise, we should not expect to be able
    to perform competent data science within a domain we do not understand, regardless
    of our statistical, analytical, technical, and related skills otherwise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you doing a shallow descriptive analysis of some run-of-the-mill dating app? Or
    are you undertaking some in-depth predictive analytics project in finance for
    an organization which specializes in some obscure securities investment strategy?
    The required knowledge of the "dating" domain to perform the first feat is likely
    negligible, but any useful insights into the second will certainly demand a solid
    financial understanding.

    get power over their data space? Intimate knowledge, by way of exploratory data
    exploration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But how much data exploration, and exactly what kind of exploration are we talking?
    This is going to surprise you, but... it's relative. If we are interested in descriptive
    analysis — that is, no prediction, along the lines of a straightforward data analysis
    — the more intimately we are familiar with the data the better. The end **is**
    the means in this case, and so the quality of describing, visualizing, and sharing
    the data, *a la* a data analyst, is highly correlated with exploration intimacy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to predictive analytics, and machine learning undertakings, there
    are differing opinions on how much exploratory data exploration is helpful. There
    are also differing opinions on the level of exploratory analysis of datasets which
    are not being used for training (i.e. validation and testing sets). This aside,
    in order to ensure maximum power over your data space is achieved, be sure to
    guard against the potential pitfalls of poor exploratory data analysis or shoddy
    visualizations, such as the [correlation fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation),
    [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox), and the
    [ecological fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy).

    you know that the choice of algorithm can severely impact the time it takes to
    complete a given computation task, even with the same data, and it is for this
    reason that algorithm and method selection is our equivalent of being able to
    fast-forward time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will apply to both the outright selection of algorithms, as well as the
    setting of hyperparameters which also have an impact on run time. Neural network
    architectures can be incredibly complex, but a pair of equivalently simple neural
    nets can have vastly different convergence times when using vastly different learning
    rates.

    but there is also a [space-time tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff),
    as well as a complexity-speed tradeoff that can be made. One logistic regression
    model might not perform quite as well as a random forest of thousands of trees,
    yet that hit to performance may be worth it to you in exchange for speed, to say
    nothing of the increase in explainability the logistic regression model may provide
    over the random forest (if that's your thing).

    that it is one of the tradeoffs you are making, and one of the best ways we have
    of controlling the flow of time.

    data science world? Computational power!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computational power (or "compute") is the collective computational resources
    we have to throw at a particular problem. Unlimited compute was once thought to
    be the be all and end all of computing, and for good reason. Consider how little
    compute there was one, two, or three decades ago, in comparison to today. Imagine
    scientists sitting around and thinking about problems they could solve, if only
    they had more than a handful of MHz worth of compute at their disposal. The sky
    would be the limit!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, that's not exactly how things have turned out. Sure, we have a lot
    more compute at our disposal now than we ever have in the past in the form of
    supercomputers, the cloud, publicly available APIs backed by heaping amounts of
    compute, and even our own notebooks and smartphones, comparatively. All sorts
    of problems we could never have imagined would have enough compute to solve are
    now tractable, and that's a great development. We need to keep in mind, however,
    that "clever" is a great counterbalance to compute, and lots of advancement in
    data science and its supportive technologies have been made possible by brain
    over brawn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, a perfect balance of brain and brawn could be used to attack every
    problem out there, with clever being used to setup a perfect algorithmic approach,
    and the necessary compute being available to back it up. Perhaps this is an area
    data science will one day prove to help itself.

    bit devious. But if we take a more positive spin on the concept of the Soul Stone,
    we could force an equivalence between it and the power of prediction. We are training
    models to control the innermost essence of unlabeled data — its **soul** — by
    making informed predictions as to what it truly holds.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Soul Stone, then, is analogous to the power of prediction, which is to say
    it lies at the absolute core of data science. What are data scientists trying
    to accomplish? They are trying to answer interesting questions with available
    data in order to make predictions which align as closely as possible with reality.
    That prediction piece seems pretty crucial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And, given that it is so crucial, it should be evident that the outcomes of
    data science should be handled with the utmost care. Not to oversell it, but the
    soul of our work is the value it can create (whether that be to business, to charities,
    to government, to society in general), and taking this lightly, or just treating
    the predictive outcomes as another of the steps in the data science process, is
    ill advised.

    insightful. It's now time to inform the project stakeholders of the outcomes.
    But the non-data scientists among us don't have the same interests in, or understandings
    of, data and the data science process, so we need to be effective in presenting
    our findings to them in a way they will appreciate.
  prefs: []

    acknowledgement of the reality that everyone has different skills, interests,
