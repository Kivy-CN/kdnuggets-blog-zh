    are interested in diving deep beyond what is covered in online courses. For me
    personally, one textbook that stood out to me (I still consult this book as my
    main reference when working on data science projects) is the book: **“*****Machine
    Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn*****”, by Sebastian Raschka. **This book
    provides a great introduction to data science and machine learning, with code
    included. The GitHub repository for this book with code for all chapters can be
    accessed by clicking on this link: [https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book](https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book)

    author explains fundamental concepts in data science and machine learning in a
    way that is very easy to follow. Also, the code is included, so you can actually
    use the code provided to practice and build your own models. I have personally
    found this book to be very useful in my data science journey. I would recommend
    this book to any data science aspirant. All that you need is basic linear algebra
    and programming skills to be able to understand the book. There are lots of other
    excellent data science textbooks out there such as “[Python for Data Analysis](https://sushilapalwe.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/python-for-data-analytics-book.pdf)”
    by Wes McKinney, “[Applied Predictive Modeling](https://vuquangnguyen2016.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/applied-predictive-modeling-max-kuhn-kjell-johnson_1518.pdf)”
    by Kuhn & Johnson, and “[Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques](https://www.wi.hs-wismar.de/~cleve/vorl/projects/dm/ss13/HierarClustern/Literatur/WittenFrank-DM-3rd.pdf)”

    can hone your skills by applying your newly acquired knowledge to data science
    projects. As you challenge yourself to apply your knowledge to real-world data
    science projects, it will help you to develop in-depth knowledge in core data
    science concepts. Kaggle competitions in data science provide good challenging
    projects individuals with advanced knowledge in data science.

    on various topics in data science and machine learning by teaming up with other
    data science aspirants. Network with other data science aspirants and professionals;
    share your code on GitHub; and showcase your skills on platforms such as LinkedIn,
    Kaggle, or Medium. This would help you to learn a lot of new concepts and tools
    within a short period of time. You also get exposed to new ways of doing things,
    as well as to new cutting-edge algorithms and technologies. Networking will also
    enable you to sharpen your communication and team player skills.

    forced to understand the core concepts, and your goal is to explain these core
    concepts to your students or the public in a way that is easy to understand. Blogging
    is an excellent way to develop and advance your knowledge in data science. When
    I am trying to learn something new, I always challenge myself to write a blog
    on the subject. It is a way that I can prove to myself that I have understood
    the concept. There are numerous platforms for blogging in data science such as
    [Medium](https://medium.com), [KDnuggets](/), etc. You can also earn income from
    your blogs, which is great for supplemental income.
