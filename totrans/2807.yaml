- en: To many, Machine Learning may be a new word, but it was first coined by Arthur
    Samuel in 1952, and since then, the constant [evolution of Machine Learning](https://www.mobileappdaily.com/evolution-of-machine-learning)
    has made it the go-to technology for many sectors. Right from robotic process
    automation to technical expertise, Machine Learning technology is extensively
    used to make predictions and get valuable insight into business operations. It's
    considered as the subset of Artificial Intelligence (intelligence demonstrated
    by machines).
