- en: Algorithms are essential for carrying out any dynamic computer program. The
    higher the algorithm's efficiency, the higher the execution speed. Algorithms
    are developed based on the mathematical approaches we already know. Random forest
    and decision tree are algorithms used for classification and regression-related
    problems. They help handle large chunks of data that require rigorous algorithms
    to help make better analyses and decisions.

    tree along with decision nodes and leaf nodes. Here decision nodes are in order
    of two or more branches, whereas the leaf node represents a decision. A decision
    tree is used to handle categorical and continuous data. It is a simple and effective
    decision-making diagram.

- en: As one can see, trees are an easy and convenient way to visualize the results
    of algorithms and understand how decisions are made. The main advantage of a decision
    tree is that it adapts quickly to the dataset. The final model can be viewed and
    interpreted in an orderly manner using a "tree" diagram. Conversely, since the
    random forest algorithm builds many individual decision trees and then averages
    these predictions, it is much less likely to be affected by outliers.

    works on both classification and regression tasks. The forest has almost the same
    hyperparameters as a decision tree. Its ensemble method of decision trees is generated
    on randomly split data. This entire group is a forest where each tree has a different
    independent random sample.

    too slow and inefficient for real-time prediction. In contrast, the results are
    generated based on randomly selected observations and features built on different
    decision trees in the random forest algorithm.

- en: Conversely, since random forests use only a few predictors to build each decision
    tree, the final decision trees tend to be decorrelated, meaning that the random
    forest algorithm model is unlikely to outperform the dataset. As mentioned earlier,
    decision trees usually overwrite the training data - meaning they are more likely
    to match the "noise" in the dataset than the actual underlying model.

- en: The critical difference between the random forest algorithm and decision tree
    is that decision trees are graphs that illustrate all possible outcomes of a decision
    using a branching approach. In contrast, the random forest algorithm output are
    a set of [decision trees](/2020/02/decision-tree-intuition.html) that work according
    to the output.

    the random forest algorithm because they are so accurate and because modern computers
    and systems can usually handle large, previously unmanageable datasets.

- en: The downside of the random forest algorithm is that you can't visualize the
    final model, and if you don't have enough processing power or the dataset you're
    working with is very large. They can take a long time to create.

- en: The benefit of a simple decision tree is that the model is easy to interpret.
    When we build the decision tree, we know which variable and which value the variable
    uses to split the data, predicting the outcome quickly. On the other hand, the
    random forest algorithm models are more complicated because they are combinations
    of decision trees. When building a random forest algorithm model, we have to define
    how many trees to make and how many variables are needed for each node.

- en: 'In general, more trees will improve performance and make predictions more stable
    but also slow down the computation speed. For regression problems, the average
    of all trees is taken as the final result. A random forest algorithm regression
    model has two levels of means: first, the sample in the tree target cell, then
    all trees. Unlike linear regression, it uses existing observations to estimate
    values ​​outside the observed range.'

    there was a way to generate many trees by averaging their solutions, you would
    most likely get an answer very close to the real answer. In this article, we saw
    the difference between the random forest algorithm and decision tree, where a
    decision tree is a graph structure that uses a branching approach and provides
    results in all possible ways. In contrast, the random forest algorithm merges
    decision trees from all their decisions, depending on the result. The main advantage
    of a decision tree is that it adapts quickly to the dataset, and the final model
    can be viewed and interpreted in order.

    root node. It carries a series of decision nodes that stand for several decisions.
    From the decision nodes, the leaf nodes show the impact of those decisions. These
    nodes are further branched out to get better information and will continue to
    do so until all the nodes have similar consistent data.

    of decisions used to implicate specific results. While simple and easy to interpret,
    the process of splitting the data and predicting output is fast. On the other
    hand, in the case of the random forest algorithm, there are multiple stages of
    defining the trees and other critical variables that directly increase the complexity
    of the model at each node.

    bottleneck situation while training the data. The impact on the new data model
    indicates a negative performance when the dataset fails the validation criteria.
    In such scenarios, a decision tree has more possibility of overfitting. Instead,
    the random forest algorithm can reduce its exposure with multiple trees.

    critical and based on the problem statement. Decision trees are implemented when
    it involves a mixture of feature data types and easy interpretation. The random
    forest algorithm model handles multiple trees so that the performance is not affected.
    It does not require scaling or normalization. Choose wisely!
