    neighbours to identify inconsistent labels (in job titles). Then, LinkedIn trained
    a support vector machine (SVM) on the consistent labels; the SVM was then used
    to update the inconsistent labels. This helped them achieve 95% precision on their
    job title classifier.

    to our product classifier’s eventual accuracy of 95%. How was she able to contribute
    that critical insight, I asked. “Oh, I just read papers every now and then”, she
    replied. To be specific, she tries to read 1–2 papers weekly, usually around topics
    that the team was working on.

    to work (and not work). We can then adapt their approach and not have to reinvent
    the rocket. This helps us **deliver a working solution with lesser time and effort**.

    slices of data science, developments in tangential research are often helpful.
    For example, the idea of [word embeddings and graphs](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/recommender-systems-graph-and-nlp-pytorch/) have
    been useful in recommender systems. Similarly, [ideas from computer vision](https://pakodas.substack.com/p/nlp-keeps-stealing-from-cv-) —
    such as transfer learning and data augmentation — have been helpful for natural
    language processing (NLP).

- en: Reading papers also **keeps us up to date**. The field of NLP has made large
    advances in the past decade. Nonetheless, by reading the most crucial 10 or so
    papers, we can quickly get up to speed. By being up-to-date, we become more effective
    at work, thus requiring less time and effort. We then have more time to read and
    learn, leading to a virtuous cycle.

- en: If we’re starting on this habit, we can just **read whatever interests us** —
    most papers will have something to teach us. Reading about topics we’re interested
    in also make it easier to build the habit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could also select papers based on **practicality**. For example, we might
    need to quickly understand a domain for a project. Before starting on a project,
    I almost always [set aside time for a literature review](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-do-during-a-data-science-project-to-ensure-success/#research-what-others-have-done-and-what-worked).
    Spending a couple of days diving into papers can save weeks, if not months, of
    dead-ends and unnecessarily reinventing the wheel.

    One hack is to follow people we admire on social media, or subscribe to curated
    newsletters — I’ve found these sources to have a high information-to-noise ratio.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What papers do I read? Out of practicality, I mostly read papers related to
    work. This allows me to immediately apply what I’ve read and thus reinforce my
    learning. Outside of work, I have an interest in [sequences](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml#sequence-modelling) and
    tend to read about [NLP](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml#natural-language-processing) and [reinforcement
    learning](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml#reinforcement-learning). I’m
    especially fond of papers that share what worked and what didn’t, such as through
    ablation studies. This includes the papers on [Word2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781), [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805),
    and [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683).
