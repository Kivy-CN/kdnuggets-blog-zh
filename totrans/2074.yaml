- en: I have recently had a lot of folks reach out, mainly on LinkedIn, looking for
    advice on getting started in "Data Science" and/or "Big Data." These people are
    generally interested in breaking into "the field" and need some direction on how
    to go about doing so.

- en: A common theme in these requests, however (and I say this with the utmost respect),
    is a general lack of understanding of what it is they are actually asking. And
    that's fine; everyone needs to start somewhere, no matter what it is they are
    learning. Instead of answering these similar requests one by one, this post will
    serve to lay out some **very** basic concepts related to "Data Science" and/or
    "Big Data" career paths, and hopefully provide some advice on how to get one's
    feet wet in this convoluted field.

    set of 5 career paths. While there may be mass outcry and widespread panic related
    to this particular division of roles, they really serve to categorize skills and
    professional responsibilities at a high level, and so I believe the following
    is quite useful for orienting newcomers to the myriad opportunities which exist
    in this professional realm, myriad opportunities which are often easily conflated
    and confused.

    management professional is concerned with managing data and the infrastructure
    which supports it. There is little to no data analysis that takes place in such
    a role, and the use of languages such as Python and R is likely not necessary.
    SQL may be of use, as well as Hadoop-related query languages such as Hive or Pig.

    in the previous career path? Well, it needs to be designed and implemented, and
    the data engineer does that. If the data management professional is the car mechanic,
    data engineering is the automotive engineer. But don't get it twisted; both of
    these roles are crucial to both the delivery and continued functioning of your
    car, and are of equal importance when you are driving from point A to point B.

    reading specific to the data engineer.

- en: While the previous pair of roles were related to designing the infrastructure
    to manage the data, as well as actually managing the data, business analysts are
    chiefly concerned with pulling from the data, more or less as it currently exists.
    This can be contrasted with the following 2 roles (machine learning researcher/practitioner
    and the data-oriented professional), both of which focus on eliciting insight
    from data above and beyond what it already tells us at face value. As such, business
    analysts require a unique set of skills among the roles presented.

    for predictive and correlative capabilities, with both roles being algorithm-based

    biggest problems related to "data science;" the term means nothing specific, but
    everything in general. This role is the Jack Of All Trades of the data world,
    knowing (perhaps) how to get a Hadoop ecosystem up and running; how to execute
    queries against the data stored within; how to extract data and house in a non-relational
    database; how to take that non-relational data and extract it to a flat file;
    how to wrangle that data in R or Python; how to engineer features after some initial
    exploratory descriptive analysis; how to select an appropriate machine learning
    algorithm to perform some predictive analytics on the data; how to statistically
    analyze the results of said predictive task; how to visualize the results for
    easy consumption by non-technical folks; and how to tell a compelling story to
    executives with the end result of the data processing pipeline just described.

    which is obviously not something that can be taught here.
