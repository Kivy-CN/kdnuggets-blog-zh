    learning R in the hopes that it could help me better analyze the data. It did.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of how I learned R, I probably read everything I could find. There
    was no single resource that told me exactly what I needed. Much of the material
    detailed techniques that were not useful to me at all. In retrospect, Winston
    Chang’s *R Graphics Cookbook* and the Coursera Data Science courses are the only
    resources that I can remember by name now.

    analytical unit was the zip code, which is itself unusual. And I was interested
    in mashing up our internal data with demographic data from external sources, such
    as the US Census Bureau. I couldn’t find anything in the R ecosystem that could
    do exactly what I needed, so I built it myself. This project wound up becoming choroplethr.

- en: Despite working as a software engineer for 10+ years in San Francisco, I had
    never created an open source project before. R has a rich tradition of this through
    its package system, and it seemed like a great opportunity for me to try something
    new.
  prefs: []

- en: Moving the project from internal use to something that others could use “off
    the shelf” was a lot of work. I genuinely wasn’t sure if anyone else would use
    the project. But at the time I thought “If this winds up helping at least one
    other person, it will have been worth it.”

    of the this writing, and according to the metacran/cranlogs app, the main choroplethr
    package has been installed 39,000 times.
