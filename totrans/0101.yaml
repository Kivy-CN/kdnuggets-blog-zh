    a degree is enough to obtain a job. One of the main suggestions is to build a
    strong portfolio with personal projects that can play an essential role in standing
    out from the crowd and impressing the recruiter.

    website, but it can be really intimidating for getting started from scratch without
    any knowledge of HTML and CSS. I tried personally, and it gives a lot of satisfaction
    when you reach the goal, but it took me a week between finding the right resources

- en: In my personal life, I use Google Assistant to ask to reproduce music of different
    genres. For example, “Google, I want to listen to rock music” and it instantly
    reproduces a random song from youtube music. It’s really more rapid than writing
    the title of the song and it learns your preferences the more it collects your
    data. Wouldn't it be cool to do it as a personal project? This project can be
    done easily by using GPT-3 to answer the question and Whisper API to transcribe
    the audio.

    I have also tried google chrome extensions to translate the text on web pages,
    but I still struggle when I have to read PDF files in English. A possible alternative
    is to build your own AI application. Every day, there is a new powerful Large
    Language Model that amazes us with its incredible results. Why should we exploit
    one of these models?!
  prefs: []

    models specialised in translations from one language to another. For example,
    you can pick [this model](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-it/tree/main)
    that is targeting Italian translation from English. After you choose the model
    for the translation, you can concretize this idea by building an application with
    Streamlit.

    But just reading a paper with a minimum of 30 pages is time-consuming and it’s
    hard to stay on top of research with this explosion of papers released every day.
    To boost research productivity, wouldn’t it be better to extract the relevant
    information from academic papers? These are the following three use cases that
    can be helpful for your career in the data science field.

- en: While working as a data scientist in my last experience, I have noticed how
    it’s important to document the code day by day. If you work by yourself, you don’t
    care about it. But when you work with a team, it becomes complex to manage tasks
    without code documentation. In particular, it can happen that a team member leaves
    the company and was the only person that understood his/her code. Even if documentation
    is really useful, it’s a very boring task that consumes time. Thanks to the boom
    of Large Language Models, we can again avoid this hard work by creating Python
    Docstring with Chat-GPT.

    of the language you are analysing. This problem can be managed fastly by using
