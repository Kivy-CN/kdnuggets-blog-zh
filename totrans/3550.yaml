    Google as an example, Google’s search autocomplete always saves my time. YouTube
    recommends a potential video list we may watch later, and Gmail spam detection
    system helps us filter spam emails although it makes mistake sometimes.

- en: Sibyl is one of the largest machine learning platforms at Google and is widely
    used in ranking and scoring of Google products like YouTube, Android app, Gmail,
    and Google+. Last month, Tushar Chandra, a Principal Engineer at Google Research,
    talked about how Sibyl is being used at IEEE/IFIP International Conference on
    Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2014).

    table above may give you an idea of the scale of problems Sibyl is dealing with.
    The number of “Features per example” shown in the table is actually “Active Features
    per example”. The number of original features per example will be around 1B. As
    long as each example is sparse, Sibyl can handle over 100B examples in 100B dimensions.
    However, it will take years to process entire data if using simple iterative algorithms
    like stochastic gradient descent, or even Vowpal Wabbit.'

    10+% improvements, which is becoming an industry “best practice”. For Google,
    1% improvement of accuracy means millions of dollars. So people are putting a
    lot of efforts to improve machine learning solutions. In fact, Sibyl is using
    Parallel Boosting Algorithm running on multiple machines.

    scheme showed above is the core of Sibyl system where each step can be done in
    parallel. I am going to skip the details. People interested in the algorithm may
    read [the paper by Collins, Schapire and Singer.](http://www.recognition.mccme.ru/pub/papers/boosting/collins00logistic.pdf)'

- en: As Tushar said, Sibyl is the only large scale machine learning system without
    distributed system built inside. MapReduce and Google File System provide what
    they need for a distributed system. Parallel Boosting Algorithm made it possible
    since it is very well suited for MapReduce and GFS.

    the Reducers. Between Mapper and Reducer, Parallel Boosting Algorithm is used.

- en: Tushar also introduced a couple of design principles, like using GFS for communication,
    column-oriented data store, using a dictionary of features, storing model and
    stats in RAM, and optimizing for multi-core, which I would not enumerate in my
    post.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sibyl would be faster and more efficient designed with these principles. For
    example, as the first table shows, the system is designed to improve efficiency
    by compressing training data as much as 80 percent by using column-oriented data
    storage. Bytes per feature could be as small as 0.67 with features integerization.
