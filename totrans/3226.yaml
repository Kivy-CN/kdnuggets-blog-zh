- en: Employee turnover (attrition) is a major cost to an organization, and predicting
    turnover is at the forefront of needs of Human Resources (HR) in many organizations.
    Until now the mainstream approach has been to use logistic regression or survival
    curves to model employee attrition. However, with advancements in machine learning
    (ML), we can now get both better predictive performance and better explanations
    of what critical features are linked to employee attrition. In this post, we’ll
    explain how we used the automated machine learning function from H2O to develop
    a predictive model that is in the same ballpark as commercial products in terms
    of ML accuracy we’ll also explain how we applied the new LIME package that enables
    breakdown of complex, black-box machine learning models into variable importance
    plots.

    are tangible such as training expenses and the time it takes from when an employee
    starts to when they become a productive member. However, the most important costs
    are intangible. Consider what’s lost when a productive employee quits: new product
    ideas, great project management, or customer relationships. With advances in machine
    learning and data science, it’s possible to not only predict employee attrition
    but to understand the key variables that influence turnover.'

    to test out several advanced ML techniques. The dataset includes 1470 employees
    (rows) and 35 features (columns) a portion of which have left the organization
    (Attrition = “Yes”). Note that according to IBM, “this is a fictional data set
    created by IBM data scientists”.

    LIME for understanding and breaking down complex, black-box models. We’ll go over
    the highlights from the analysis, but the interested reader can see the [full
    solution including code here]([http://www.business-science.io/business/2017/09/18/hr_employee_attrition.html](http://www.business-science.io/business/2017/09/18/hr_employee_attrition.html)).

    takes automated machine learning to the next level by testing a number of advanced
    algorithms such as random forests, ensemble methods, and deep learning along with
    more traditional algorithms such as logistic regression. The main takeaway is
    that we can now easily achieve predictive performance that is in the same ball
    park (and in some cases even better than) commercial algorithms and ML/AI software.'

    astounding 88% accuracy on a test set that was not seen during the modeling process.
    Further, the binary classification analysis had recall (the number of times the
    algorithm predicts Attrition = “Yes” when attrition is actually yes) of 62% meaning
    that HR professionals could accurately target 62 of 100 employees considered at
    risk. In an HR context recall is very important because we don’t want to miss
    at-risk employees and 62% performance is pretty good.

- en: '**Feature (Variable) Importance with the `lime` package**: The problem with
    advanced machine learning algorithms such as deep learning is that it’s near impossible
    to understand the algorithm because of its complexity. This has all changed with
    the `lime` package. The major advancement with `lime` is that by recursively analyzing
    the models locally it can extract feature importance that repeats globally. What
    this means to us is that `lime` has opened the door to understanding the ML models
    regardless of complexity. Now the best (and typically very complex) models can
    also be investigated and potentially understood as to what variables or features
    make the model tick.'

- en: The payoff for the work we put into using LIME is this feature importance plot.
    The top four features for each of the first ten cases (observations) are shown.
    The green bars mean that the feature supports the model conclusion and the red
    bars contradict. LIME detected Over Time, Job Role, and Training Time as features
    that are relevant to the model predictions.

- en: We then analyzed the critical features get an idea of whether the features were
    linked to attrition. For features like Over Time and Job Role, the variance appears
    to be linked. We can see that the group with Attrition = “No” has a lower proportion
    of employees working overtime. In addition roles such as Sales Representative,
    Laboratory Technician and Human Resources had a higher attrition percentage as
    compare to other Job Roles.

- en: New machine learning techniques can be applied to business applications and
    specifically predictive analytics. In this case we use H2O and LIME to develop
    and explain sophisticated models that very accurately detect employees that are
    at risk of turnover. The `h2o.autoML` function from H2O worked well for classifying
    attrition with accuracy around 88% on unseen / un-modeled data. LIME helped to
    breakdown the complex ensemble model returned from H2O into critical features
    that are related to attrition.
