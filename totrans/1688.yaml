    discussed about first three phases of the data science process namely business
    discovery, data discovery and data preparation. In business discover phase we
    talked on how the business problem i.e. predicting end life of batteries, defines
    the choice of  variables that comes into play. In the data discovery phase we
    discussed data sufficiency and other considerations like variety and velocity
    of data and how these considerations affect the data science problem formulation.
    In the last phase we touched upon how the data points and its various constituents
    drive the predictive problem formulation. In this post we will discuss further
    on how exploratory analysis can be used for getting insights for feature engineering.

    for feature engineering. When embarking upon exploratory analysis, it would be
    a good idea to get inputs from domain team on the relation between variables and
    the business problem. Such inputs are often the starting point for this phase.

    a philosophy for exploratory analysis.In the case of industrial batteries, a key
    variable which affects the state of health of a battery is its conductance. It
    turns out that an indicator of failing health of  battery is the precipitous drop
    in conductance. Armed with this information our next task should be to  identify,
    from our available data set,batteries that have higher probability to fail. Since
    precipitous fall in conductance is an indicator of failing health,the conductance
    data of  unhealthy batteries will have more variance than the normal ones. So
    the best way to identify failing batteries from the normal ones would be to apply
    some consolidating metric like standard deviation or variance on the conductance
    data and further drill deep on samples which stand apart from the normal population.

- en: The above is a plot depicting standard deviation of conductance for all batteries.
    Now what might be of interest to us is the red zone which we can call the “Potential
    failure Zone”. The potential failure zone consists of those batteries whose conductance
    values show high standard deviation. Batteries with failing health are likely
    to exhibit large fall in conductance and as a corollary their values will also
    show higher standard deviation. This implies that the samples of batteries which
    have higher probability of failure will in all likelihood be from this failure
    zone. However to ascertain this hypothesis we will have to dig deep into batteries
    in the failure zone and look for patterns which might differentiate them from
    normal batteries. Another objective to dig deep is also to elicit clues from the
    underlying patterns on what features to include in the predictive model. We will
    discuss more on the feature extraction when we discuss about feature engineering.
    Now let us come back to our discussion on digging deep into the failure zone and
    ferreting out significant patterns. It has to be noted that in addition to the
    samples in the failure zone we will also have to observe patterns from the normal
    zone to help separate wheat from the chaff . Intuitions derived by observing different
    patterns would become vital during feature engineering stage.

- en: The above figure is a comparison of patterns from either zones. The figure on
    the left is from the failure zone and the one on the right is from the other.
    We can clearly see how the precipitous fall is manifested in the sample from the
    failure zone. The other aspect to note is also the magnitude of the fall. Every
    battery will have degrading conductance over time. However the magnitude of  degradation
    is what differentiates the unhealthy  battery from a normal one. We can observe
    from the plot on the left that the fall in conductance is more than 50%, however
    for the battery to the right the drop is more muted.  Another aspect we can observe
    is the slope of conductance. As evident from the two plots, the slope of  conductance
    profile for the battery on the left is much more steeper over time than the one
    on the right. These intuitions which we have derived so far might become critical
    from the overall scheme of feature engineering and modelling. Similar to the intuitions
    which we have disinterred so far, more could be extracted by observing more samples. The
    philosophy behind exploratory analysis entails visualizing more and more samples,
    observing patterns and extracting clues for feature engineering. The more time
    we spend on doing this more ammunition we get for feature engineering.

    To summarize, here are some of the pointers during this phase.

    In our case the clue which we got was the relation between conductance and health
    of batteries.

    exploratory analysis phase.

- en: The discussions so far were centered on exploratory analysis on a single variable.
    Next we have to connect other variables to the one which we already observed and
    identify trends in unison. When we combine trends from multiple variables we will
    be able to unravel more insights for feature engineering. We will continue our
    discussions on combining more variables and subsequent feature engineering in
    our next post. Watch out this space for more.
