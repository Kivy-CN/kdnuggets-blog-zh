    responses from businesses for enterprise-scale deployments. Not just it, but even
    its enhanced version, Intelligent Automation (IA), is showing businesses its potential
    to bring revolutionary transformation with its structured and unstructured data
    processing, machine learning, and NLP capabilities.

- en: You can think of robotics process automation as a robot/bot in the form of an
    [AI-powered automation](https://www.mindinventory.com/blog/ai-powered-process-automation/)
    software program accomplishing all digital tasks for you intelligently. It does
    fill out a form step-by-step, download reports, auto-save the files after every
    amendment you do, trigger responses, and many other repetitive tasks the way you
    do.

- en: Moreover, RPA scenarios, which we just discussed above, are programmed to automate
    jobs made available for you in your ERP system. They can observe and learn employees’
    working patterns and automate routine repetitive tasks without human intervention.
    So, you can focus on your other important tasks, which indeed results in powered-up
    business productivity.

    business processes to reduce efforts and deliver high-value work and costs. On
    the other hand, some businesses see RPA as a thread leading to intelligent automation
    (IA) by leveraging AI/ML tools to build training models to predict future performance.

- en: Intelligent Automation (IA) is highly capable of automating not just routine
    but also nonroutine tasks by leveraging creativity, judgment, persuasion, and
    problem-solving capabilities. With those advanced AI capabilities, IA develops
    human-like cognitive capabilities, which can recognize handwriting, do image processes,
    and natural language processing.

- en: As the cost is the main concern for many businesses, there’s good news for businesses.
    The programmed bots are implemented in your business IT infrastructure, which
    removes additional investment for new IT infrastructure dedicated to RPA and IA
    solutions. The best thing is that they are compatible to integrate with your business
    IT systems and that too at a minimal investment.
