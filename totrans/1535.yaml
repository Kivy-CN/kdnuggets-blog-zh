    in 2017 we ran a series of articles looking at the Best Masters in Data Science
    and Analytics, looking at Online courses, courses in America/Canada and in Europe.
    Well, we’ve updated that list now with the latest details, fees and university
    rankings, as well as adding a whole bunch of new countries and courses.'

    include living expenses like transportation and housing. The tuition currency
    we have used is USD (converted price as of 6^(th) April 2019), for simplicity
    and generality and the fees shown are for the 2019-20 academic year. We’ve also
    included a World University Computer Science ranking where applicable. The programs
    listed here are all campus-based, i.e., we have not included online degrees.
