    This would descend quickly into flame war territory, so I won't try to convince
    you that you should be using Linux (though you should be), and will instead focus
    on giving a helping hand to those who *want* to use it, or already do. Pair this
    with the power of a command line, and the fact that a plethora of flavors of Linux
    exist that are open source, and you have the ingredients for your ideal, tailored
    workstation with all the OS horsepower you need.

    thinking of it as constructing short combinations of programming commands in a
    [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). You
    can code, right? Then you can use the command line.
