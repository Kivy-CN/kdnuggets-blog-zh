- en: Getting interviews is naturally essential for many jobs and data science jobs
    are no exception. Although resources on this topic are certainly not lacking,
    practical and actionable advice is rare. Going into my job search I knew that
    over 70% of job seekers find employment through some form of networking. I knew
    that I should “*contact recruiters and build up my network to break in the field”*.
    But even knowing this I was still left with an important question: **how**?

    grad school in Feb. 2017\. I tried everything I could to get interviews including…

    through AngelList.

    laid off by my then startup company in Dec. 2018\. This time around I got **10
    interview opportunities** within a month using 50 applications and 18 referrals
    (spent less than 30 hours in total). This enormous difference was not because
    I had job experience. In truth, I was not much more competitive on the job market
    the second time. This drastic change was because I did it all wrong the first
    time! This was not because the articles on getting a data science interview were
    misleading or incorrect, but they only told me what to do not how to do it.

- en: There are three ways to get interviews: **raw application**, **contacting the
    gatekeeper**, and **getting referrals**. Raw application means simply submitting
    your resume to job openings. Although this is an easy method, it also tends to
    have low efficiency. Contacting the gatekeeper can be more effective but requires
    a bit more effort. Getting a referral is the most effective way, but it also takes
    the most amount of time and effort (assuming that you don’t know anyone willing
    to refer you yet). The below diagram gives a visual of the three methods in terms
    of effort/time and effectiveness.

    immediately to popular online job boards, such as LinkedIn, GlassDoor, or Indeed.
    The first time I looked for jobs, I submitted hundreds of applications on LinkedIn
    but got **zero** replies. In fact, some of my friends who are making career transitions
    also find themselves getting no replies on LinkedIn. When my second job search
    began, I did not submit a single application on LinkedIn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why? The problem was that for each job post, hundreds of applicants applied
    within a week. If you rely solely on these popular job boards, the chances that
    you will get a response are slim. You are competing against a mountain of candidates!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, the fact is that in recent years, LinkedIn has become a platform
    that serves recruiters who want to reach potential candidates with an exact experience
    and qualifications. It’s not a platform that serves job seekers with a lack of
    experience because you have to compete with hundreds (sometimes thousands) of
    applicants for a position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to get around this problem is to **apply on less popular websites**.
    Use websites that are not yet mainstream. Skeptical? Edouard Harris does an excellent
    job of explaining why “*companies pay more attention to applicants who apply through
    less known channels*” in his [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-no-one-will-tell-you-about-data-science-job-applications-bff2d4b5e983).
    Here are some websites that I and people I know have tried and have proven to
    be helpful. Some are even specifically data science-related.

    will greatly increase your chances of getting a response.

    big job boards, it can still take weeks for recruiters to respond since they always
    have a pile of resumes to review. Now you would want to try the second method
    — reaching out to the gatekeeper directly. I was able to get responses much faster
    using this method than raw applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A gatekeeper refers to a **technical recruiter** or a **data scientist** in
    the company in which you are interested in working. Big companies typically have
    technical recruiters that are dedicated to hiring data scientists, but the data
    team at smaller companies may be more self-contained. If you can win over the
    gatekeeper, it could allow you to move on in the job hiring process.

    friends, and even random people to get referrals. However, I ended up not getting
    any. In contrast, the second time I looked for jobs, people within my network
    told me they were willing to refer me before I even asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, I have learned some misconceptions about asking for referrals. Getting
    a referral is to **get someone** **familiar with your work to give a glowing referral** to
    their companies. It is **NOT** hassling strangers you found on LinkedIn or somewhere
    else. Besides most of the time, the latter approach doesn’t work.

    a place to showcase everything you know or can do. Adding too much content only
    overwhelms people with unnecessary information. Therefore, in your data science
    resume, you want to highlight the most important things related to data science,
    such as work experience, training, and relevant skills. When a recruiter or a
    hiring manager sees your resume, they should immediately feel that you have lots
    of experience in data science and that you are a qualified candidate.
