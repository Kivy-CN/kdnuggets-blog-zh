    is a machine learning technique used for classification or prediction in data
    sets which have many features, but where most of them have little value and should
    be ignored.

    Some are good at converting images into text, others are good at detecting objects
    in photos but not so much for recognizing people’s faces, and others still focus
    on finding patterns in colour schemes. Now say that you have an image with two
    people in it: one smiling and one frowning—which one is the happier of the two?
    Assuming this isn’t something to be kept as a secret (which it probably shouldn’t
    be), then you need more than just judging by appearances. You want to learn what
    makes people happy and sad, so instead of having various algorithms that each
    specialize in identifying different emotions—you want to create a single algorithm
    that knows how to recognize both emotions equally well. In such cases, using a
    machine learning algorithm like **Logistic Regression** can help you achieve your
    goal more effectively. [**Learn More**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/an-introduction-to-logistic-regression/).'

    new data point. For example, an email may be labelled as spam or ham (not spam)
    for each instance. To create a logistic regression algorithm that works for multi-class
    and multi-labelling problems, you may add this feature. We will demonstrate how
    logistic regression works in Scikit Learn for real-time problems in this lecture.
    This is an example of a binary classification problem. To create a logistic regression

- en: Logistic regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used
    to predict the probability of certain classes based on some dependent variables.
    In short, the logistic regression model computes a sum of the input features (in
    most cases, there is a bias term), and calculates the logistic of the result.

- en: The output of logistic regression is always between (0, and 1), which is suitable
    for a binary classification task. The higher the value, the higher the probability
    that the current sample is classified as class=1, and vice versa.

    is the input data. The output is the prediction value when the value is closer
    to 1, which means the instance is more likely to be a positive sample(y=1). If
    the value is closer to 0, this means the instance is more likely to be a negative
    sample(y=0).

    is the label of the i-th sample, ![Equation](../Images/d187a6e3c2fb53333edff7a4b3d6dc81.png)
    i is the prediction value of the i-th sample. When the current sample’s label
    is 1, then the second term of the formula is 0\. We hope the larger the first
    term, the better, and vice versa. Finally, we add the loss of all samples, take
    the average, and add a negative sign. We want to minimize the quadratic cost function
    ![Equation](../Images/930cb17979943bee3e1b67950f690dc9.png). When ![Equation](../Images/930cb17979943bee3e1b67950f690dc9.png)

    method to find ![Equation](../Images/8e667acc74548c20685e6712ece84537.png). To
    achieve this goal, we need to use some optimization algorithms, such as gradient
    descent. Since ![Equation](../Images/930cb17979943bee3e1b67950f690dc9.png) is
    a convex function, the gradient descent is guaranteed to find a global minimum.

- en: Machine learning generally involves predicting a quantitative outcome or a qualitative
    class. The former is commonly referred to as a regression problem. In the scenario
    of linear regression, the input is a continuous variable, and the prediction is
    a numerical value. When predicting a qualitative outcome (class), the task is
    considered a classification problem. Examples of classification problems include
    predicting what products a user will buy or if a target user will click on an
    online advertisement.

- en: Not all algorithms fit cleanly into this simple dichotomy, though, and logistic
    regression is a notable example. Logistic regression is part of the regression
    family as it involves predicting outcomes based on quantitative relationships
    between variables. However, unlike linear regression, it accepts both continuous
    and discrete variables as input and its output is qualitative. In addition, it
    predicts a discrete class such as “Yes/No” or “Customer/Non-customer”.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, the [**logistic regression algorithm**](https://www.interviewbit.com/data-science-interview-questions/)
    analyzes relationships between variables. It assigns probabilities to discrete
    outcomes using the Sigmoid function, which converts numerical results into an
    expression of probability between 0 and 1.0\. Probability is either 0 or 1, depending
    on whether the event happens or not. For binary predictions, you can divide the
    population into two groups with a cut-off of 0.5\. Everything above 0.5 is considered
    to belong to group A, and everything below is considered to belong to group B.

    possible) after data points have been assigned to a class using the Sigmoid function.
    The class of future data points can then be predicted using the decision boundary.

- en: The logistic regression model is an analysis technique that helps predict the
    probability of an event happening in the future. This article will explain what
    logistic regression is, how it works, and how you can use it for forecasting.
    Logistic regression is a supervised learning method that helps to predict events
    that have a binary outcome, such as whether a person will successfully pass a
    driving test. In order to make predictions in this scenario, you need data from
    past test results. The model takes this data and predicts the likelihood that
    the same person will pass the test in the future. The main idea behind logistic
    regression is to use a model based on the probability of an outcome occurring.
