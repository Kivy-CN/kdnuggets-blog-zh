    sales conversion rates. In this scenario, retailers leverage AI, specifically
    computer vision techniques, to enhance the visual appeal of product images, increasing
    the likelihood of the buyer clicking on the product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As part of the sales funnel structure, the increase in clicks, in general, flows
    down to the higher conversion rates, i.e. sales. Extending it further, the retailers
    can conduct hypothesis tests and experiment with different image qualities, determining
    which image attributes, such as high-definition pixels and appropriate lighting,
    contribute to driving conversions.

- en: Most e-commerce websites host products from different sellers, resulting in
    heterogeneous ways of listing product descriptions, which are often inconsistent
    and incomplete.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The lack of awareness and insights on what constitutes a compelling shopping
    experience leads to inconsistency in style, length, tone, and completeness, potentially
    impacting users’ purchasing decisions.

- en: However, with Generative AI – the AI technique to generate content, such as
    text, images, videos, etc. based on large datasets, the companies can generate
    effective product descriptions which can lead to increased clickability, and in
    turn, a high conversion rate.
  prefs: []

    but also engaging and persuasive, tapping into the attention of users. Extending
    this a step further, the algorithms can even learn user preferences and provide
    product descriptions that resonate most with them. It is worthwhile to note that
    the retailers can continue enhancing and building on such AI systems, based on
    the responsiveness of model outcomes with the users.

    seller risk-management system to monitor risks related to product quality, customer
    service, and adherence to ethical standards.

    transaction records, to detect irregularities or deviations from expected norms.
    Such deviations flag the sellers that might exhibit non-compliance with the platform's
    policies and the code of conduct.

    pricing, and responsiveness to customer inquiries to highlight seller behavior.
    The ones who consistently receive negative reviews or complaints, engage in fraudulent
    activities, or violate terms of service agreements can lead to bad customer experience
    as well as tarnish the platform's reputation.

    their engagement by leveraging AI. In addition to ensuring the quality of reliable
    sellers, such AI systems also foster trust and build confidence among customers.

    true to a certain extent. But think of a customer who became a victim of a fraudulent
    transaction on the retail platform and tries to connect with the retailer to reverse
    the sale.

    for the customer, the retailer is the first layer of trust aka defense. Imagine,
    if the retailer would have an AI-powered algorithm that could identify the potential
    fraud based on the buyer’s purchase history and could introduce an additional
    identification step to proceed to the sale, then the fraud is stopped at the very
    layer of defense already.

    to remember the size specific to a brand. AI is known for taking away the cognitive
    load from the customer and can help make relevant recommendations, enhancing their
    shopping experience. For example, if the algorithm suggests the size based on
    purchase history, user characteristics, and possibly the feedback on sizing preferences.
    There you go – full points on customer delight.
