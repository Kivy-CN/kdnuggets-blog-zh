    will continue to hype a bit throughout 2019 but then face the problem that only
    fairly well-defined types of data science problems lend themselves to full automation.
    Much more powerful are environments where the data scientist can mix automation
    with interaction, truly allowing them to deploy data science to others without
    having to outsource all of it to self-declared experts. Interpretability will
    turn into a larger problem for deep learning for all types of data where understanding
    (or controlling) the underlying decision is important. We will never accept "human
    failure" from AI for safety critical decisions.

    involve humans and AI. The most innovative companies have already started planning
    how to best make this symbiotic future a reality. In the shorter term – this means
    the gap in skilled workers in data science will persists and demand will remain
    very high. Educational opportunities will expand to help address the need. In
    the long term – as we develop the skills and technology to unlock AI – society
    stands to benefit enormously from AI-augmented workers, homes, vehicles, power
    grids, factories, cities, more.
