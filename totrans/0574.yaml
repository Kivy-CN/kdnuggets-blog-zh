- en: To date, there are more than 830,000 data science LinkedIn profiles registered
    worldwide. Despite this number of Data Scientists available/in roles online currently,
    it’s no secret there is still a major talent shortage. In fact, according to a
    report by O’Reilly Media, nearly half of all European companies are struggling
    to fill data science positions. Studies performed by Indeed’s Hiring Lab show
    an overall increase of 256% in data science job openings since 2013, with an increase
    of 31% year over year from as recent as December 2018. Data science is a vast,
    complex industry with many subsets.

    There are start-ups, unicorns, and conglomerates that will want to work with you.

    profile, let’s drill down into the data science recruitment process. The Big Cloud
    recruitment team collectively holds more than 20+ years of experience in the talent
    search. Specifically, professionals working within Data Science, Machine Learning
    & Artificial Intelligence organisations.

    avoid common mistakes frequented on data science profiles. Taken from a headhunter
    perspective, we take a look at what information is the most appealing when a job
    application is being reviewed.

- en: Q. Buzzword Bingo. Only list skills that you can clearlyshow you have experience
    in. Better still, support your skillset within the context of a project description. If
    there’s no evidence that you have applied your experience to any given project,
    it implies you’re not qualified for the role you’re applying for. You’d be surprisedhow
    many applications I receive from Data Scientists that do not include any references
    to projects that they have worked on – [*Alyesha Sayle – Senior Technical Recruiter

    rather see a profile description that has a concise overview of key work objectives
    and experience. Also, candidates who don’t accept InMails are making a big mistake.
    If you’re open to new opportunities but aren’t accepting InMails, you could be
    missing out on new, exciting roles. Take the time to check you have your settings
    optimised so that you can be contacted by a recruiter. – *[Tom Harris – Principal

    the role?**'
  prefs: []

- en: A. It becomes apparent within the first 5 – 10 seconds of browsing an applicants
    profile. A strong candidate will have taken time to perfect their profile and
    communicate their professional experience. It’s refreshing when candidates have distinctlyinjected
    some personality into their profile. This near enough always encourages me to
    keep reading through their information. It’s also a huge bonus if the candidate
    has listed examples of projects that they have worked on. It means I can direct
    them to more relevant and exciting roles, and nobody's time is wasted. – *[Nicholas

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with a clear list of the tech they’ve worked on, whether that be in the profile
    summary or listed in keywords. If there is no information listed under each role,
    I’ll most likely move onto the next applicant – [*Chris Harrison – Senior Consultant

    you have available on your profile, the lower the chances of your account showing
    as fitting for a potential new role. This means you could be a great candidate
    but might not be contacted because your profile doesn’t reflect who you are and
    what you can do. *[Chris Bradbury – (Deep Learning & Computer Vision Recruiter)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-bradbury-80b5a884/)*

    for candidates with a core set of industry-standard skills. There are too many
    candidates out there applying for jobs that fail to either possess or include
    key skills such as Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, and AWS. If you have
    these included in your profile, it makes a big difference. Also, it’s never nice
    to read somebody talking about themselves in the third person – [*Dan Kettle –

    link to either their own website or Github profile. Better yet, include both if
    you have both. Being able to dive right into an applicants background and ability
    always stands out to me when I’m reviewing applications, and I’ll be more inclined
    to contact candidates who have considered including this information – [*Jess

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A. Most certainly yes. It’s quite common for candidates to include details of
    their publications on their CV, and if I am contacting a candidate after reviewing
    their application, I’ll often ask for details of where this can be found. I think
    it would be hugely beneficial for data science applicants to make use of LinkedIn’s
    article writing as it’s great for raising awareness of who you are and gives recruiters
    more insight into your experience when browsing your profile. – *[Carsten Jahn
