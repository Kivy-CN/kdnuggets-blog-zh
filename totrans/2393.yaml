- en: Financial services firms are increasingly employing artificial intelligence
    to better not just their operational operations, but also business-related tasks,
    including assigning credit scores, identifying fraud, optimizing investment portfolios,
    and supporting innovations. AI improves the speed, precision, and efficacy of
    human efforts in these operations, and it can automate data management chores
    that are currently done manually. However, as AI advances, new challenges arise.

    black box AI-powered solutions. This has accelerated the need for explainability
    in ML models across industries. In fact, according to Gartner, by 2025, 30% of
    government and large enterprise contracts for the purchase of AI products and
    services will require the use of explainable and ethical AI.

- en: While AI in financial services is currently limited to tasks such as process
    automation and marketing, it might get complex and evolve in the future, making
    the black box model approach risky. Black box AI provides no explainability and
    transparency, leaving the stakeholders with questions as to why a model failed
    or how it arrived at a particular decision. To deal with this, banking and financial
    institutions are exploring explainability in AI models across various applications.

- en: Explainable AI models allow stakeholders to comprehend the main drivers of model-driven
    decisions and interpret the decisions made by AI and ML models. In fact, the European
    GDPR regulation states that the existence of automated decision-making should
    carry meaningful information about the logic involved. Explainable models must
    be able to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses,
    and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future, overcoming
    the challenges of black box AI which cannot explain why and how a model reached
    a specific decision point.

    due to prejudice of designers, faulty training data, or no proper business context.
    It makes ML algorithms transparent, robust and accountable. It does so by assigning
    reason codes to decisions and making them visible to users. Stakeholders can review
    these codes to both explain decisions and verify outcomes. Good explainable AI
    must be highly scalable, easy to understand, highly personalized, and comply with
    regulatory and privacy requirements as per the use case and country.

- en: Financial institutions follow strict regulatory policies, and any incorrect
    decision can cost millions of dollars and damage consumer confidence. It is, therefore,
    imperative for financial companies to subject AI models to rigorous, dynamic model
    risk management and validation. The bank must ensure that the proposed AI solution
    can provide the required transparency depending on the use case.

    organizations to understand their obligations regarding AI explainability and
    how to operationalize them. Below we discuss a few use cases where AI in financial
    services is extensively used and why explainable models are crucial in each scenario.

    the lending standards. It is crucial that the banks understand why or why not
    the AI is making decisions about offering or rejecting loans to customers. AI
    explainability ensures that decision is fair and not biased based on gender or

    reasoning because of the complex neural network architecture designed to execute
    AI. It also demands different stakeholders to have different levels of explanation.
    They must be able to provide a reason for each decision. For instance, in the
    case of loan approval AI systems, if the system denies a loan application, it
    should be able to explain why it denied the application while also suggesting
    if the outcome is correct or not. The model should be able to answer the following
    questions to understand if the model is working correctly or not.

    challenging to create them as models grow in complexity and precision. There are
    also concerns about competitors reverse-engineering the proprietary machine learning
    models and algorithms. There may also be a risk of launching adversarial attacks
    leading to malfunction. To overcome these challenges many financial institutions
    are starting to leverage state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining explainability.
