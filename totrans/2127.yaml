  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Structured data refers to data types that are consistently formatted and repeated.
    Classic examples include banking transactions, airline reservations, retail sales,
    and telephone call records.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This data typically arises from transactional processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such data is well-suited to storage and management within a conventional database
    management system due to its uniform format.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, text is often categorized as unstructured data. Historically,
    before the development of textual disambiguation techniques, incorporating text
    into a standard database management system was challenging due to its less rigid
    structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this brings us to the following question‚Ä¶
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is text genuinely unstructured, or does it possess an underlying structure that's
    not immediately apparent?
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Text inherently possesses a structure, yet this complexity doesn't align with
    the conventional structured format recognizable by computers. Computers are able
    to interpret simple, straightforward structures, but language, with its elaborate
    syntax, falls outside their field of comprehension.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So this brings us to a final question:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If computers struggle to process unstructured data efficiently, is it possible
    to convert this unstructured data into a structured format for better handling?
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Manual conversion to structured data is time-consuming and has a high risk of
    human error. It's often a mishmash of words, sentences, and paragraphs, in a wide
    variety of formats which makes it difficult for machines to grasp its meaning
    and to structure it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this is precisely where LLMs play a key role. Converting unstructured data
    into a structured format is essential if we want to work or process it somehow,
    including data analysis, information retrieval, and knowledge management.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for extracting insights from unstructured data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    define what we need. Here are four ways you can leverage these models into getting
    structured insights from unstructured data:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Text Summarization
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs can efficiently summarize large volumes of text, such as reports, articles,
    or lengthy documents. This can be particularly useful for quickly understanding
    key points and themes in extensive data sets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our case, it is way better to have a first summary of the review rather than
    the whole review. So, GPT can deal with it in seconds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And our only - and most important task - will be crafting a good prompt.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These models can be used for sentiment analysis, determining the tone and sentiment
    of text data such as customer reviews, social media posts, or feedback surveys.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most simple, yet most used, classification of all time is polarity.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By analyzing these sentiments, businesses can gauge public opinion, customer
    satisfaction, and market trends. So, instead of having a person decide for each
    review, we can have our friend GPT to classify them for us.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs can identify and categorize themes or topics within large datasets. This
    is particularly useful for qualitative data analysis, where you might need to
    sift through vast amounts of text to understand common themes, trends, or patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When analyzing reviews, it can be useful to understand the main purpose of the
    review. Some users will be complaining about something (service, quality, cost‚Ä¶),
    some users will be rating their experience with the product (either in a good
    or a bad way) and some others will be performing questions.
  prefs: []

    friend GPT, it only takes a few lines of code:'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs can be used to extract keywords. This means, detecting any element we ask
    for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine for instance that we want to understand if the product where the review
    is attached is the product the user is talking about. To do so, we need to detect
    what product is the user reviewing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And again‚Ä¶ we can ask our GPT model to find out the main product the user is
    talking about.
  prefs: []

- en: In conclusion, the transformative power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in converting
    unstructured data into structured insights cannot be overstated. By harnessing
    these models, we can extract meaningful information from the vast sea of unstructured
    data that flows within our digital world.
