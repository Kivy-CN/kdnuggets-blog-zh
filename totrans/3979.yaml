    we would use the Numpy package as well. So, install them both.

- en: Pandas are typically not known to process large datasets as memory-intensive
    operations with the Pandas package can take too much time or even swallow your
    whole RAM. However, there are ways to improve efficiency in panda operations.

    large Datasets in Pandas.

    changing the data type, especially to a memory-friendly type, and drop any unnecessary
    columns.

    memory footprint. Using category type to the categorical column with a small number
    of unique values would also help. Smaller columns also help with memory efficiency.

    more efficient if process it iteratively. For example, we want to get the column
    mean, but the dataset is too big. We can process 100,000 data at a time and get
    the total result.

    memory intensive. Alternatively, it’s better to use vectorized operations or the
    `.apply` method with normal function.

    than directly using the Lambda function with `.apply`

- en: Then, using `inplace=True`in many Pandas operations is much more memory-efficient
    than assigning them back to their DataFrame. It’s much more efficient because
    assigning them back would create a separate DataFrame before we put them into
    the same variable.

    limit the amount of data we process.
