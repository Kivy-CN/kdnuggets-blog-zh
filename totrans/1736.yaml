- en: Lately I’ve seen a lot of hype surrounding -- and lots of newcomers to -- the
    Data Science field. But what exactly is SCIENCE in Data Science? The scientific
    method to approach a problem, in my point of view, is the best way to tackle a
    problem and offer the best solution. If you start your data analysis by simply
    stating hypotheses and applying Machine Learning algorithms, this is the wrong
    way.

    data analysis and simulation. In fact, it is a sketch of what I did in my PhD
    thesis. In a few words, I studied the past 27 years of Business Management literature
    and I tried to develop an epistemologically disruptive approach to measure and
    predict service quality, mixing Business Administration with Electrical Engineering
    concepts. Over the course of 4 years I performed quali-quantitative longitudinal
    research and developed a simulation using Agent-Based Modeling to try to find
    a 5 State Cellular Automata rule that could mimic human behavior. I approached
    Complexity concepts, self-organizing systems, emergence of order, and social networks.

    priori* and *a posteriori* bias when working on a solution to a problem. *A priori*
    bias happens when you start analyzing something with a preconceived idea. In this
    case, your findings will only confirm what you initially stated, because the whole
    research process was biased. *A posteriori* bias happens when you start analyzing
    something, but in fact you already know what the outcome is, then the whole process
    is biased too.

    ways to solve it. In the Data Science process this is vital, because creativity
    allows you to have a clear picture of the whole environment.

    to leverage profit, return on investment? Do you know exactly HOW your business
    adds value to the customer? What is value? Who exactly is the customer? What are
    the needs and perceptions of the customers? How are you going to get all these
    data? Is there market research you can use along with the business data?

- en: 'To start building a scientific approach to your problem, first define the problem,
    the gap in the literature (in case you are a Master''s or PhD student) or the
    business need: WHAT is going on, WHAT do we want to achieve, WHO are the beneficiaries
    (stakeholders) of the strategy and data analysis, WHEN you are going to start
    and finish, with what kind of resources and algorithms, HOW are you going to achieve
    your goals and WHY?'

    kind of knowledge is involved in the problem? Suppose you are dealing with customer
    churn. What is making people leave your business? Of course, anyone can have the
    intuition about the causes, but remember that there are scientific articles that
    are a valuable source of knowledge, more so than random guesses.'

    Value is something unique, usually brought by human resources, that cannot be
    copied and no competitor can offer. This leads to competitive advantage, more
    profits, loyalty, word-of-mouth advertising and repurchase.

- en: Note that so far we didn’t even thought about hypotheses and algorithms. Only
    after knowing exactly which are the variables involved in the problem, we develop
    hypotheses. Let’s say you suppose that profit is leveraged by a positive customer
    perception of product quality and high word-of-mouth advertising about your firm.
    This is the nomological network, where you draw correlations and causalities.
    In Data Science, you need to know what the customer perception is and also if
    there is word-of-mouth advertising. Then you realize you are working with different
    datasets, one Market Research and other Social Media referrals. You also have
    another dataset with the financial data of your company (contains profit data).

- en: 'Now it’s time to choose: do you opt for a quantitative approach, structured
    data in Market Research dataset and in Financial Data? But Social Media is unstructured,
    so you have to make a qualitative approach using Natural Language Processing.
    Even worse, you want to make a longitudinal analysis, converting data into time
    series to analyze with ARIMA. Ah, profit call be predicted using Deep Neural Networks
    using data from Market Research, Financial Data and word embeddings from Social
    Media as features!'

    regression, deep learning, unsupervised learning, accuracy, overfitting, bias-variance
    trade-off, hyperparameter tuning. The fun begins!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, the fun has begun, but note that in this specific case it was a long journey
    before we reached the algorithms. There was an entire aspect of planning on the
    research problem. One cannot simply “apply the algorithm“ and check measures of
    fit and overfit. Another big issue is that when you have a complete picture of
    what is going on, you usually will find out there is data you need, and it simply
    does not exist.

    the **external validity** of models (power of generalization): Your model performs
    well on the training set and test set, with little or no overfitting, but do the
    findings apply to new situations? Does your test set distribution replicate real
    world scenarios? Yes, but we cannot forget other types of validation, like:'

    and suggest strategic moves to upper management. Note that Data Scientists need
    the complete involvement of Business Managers to succeed. Findings from data analysis
    and modeling must generate insights for strategic decisions, market positioning,
    product launch, brand image and so many other areas.

    Natural Language Processing, A.I. algorithms and formulas. It’s not only STEM.
    It’s about an interdisciplinary and rigorous approach we borrow from academia
    to bring profits above average for businesses, frequently involving Psychology,
    Game Theory, Business Administration, Complexity, Non linear effects and complex
    causality.
