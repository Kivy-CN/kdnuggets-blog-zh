- en: As interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Machine Learning
    (ML), grows and more engineers enter this popular field, the lack of de facto
    standards and frameworks for how work should be done is becoming more apparent.
    A new focus on optimizing the ML delivery pipeline is starting to gain momentum.

    and it is a non-trivial task ensuring that their work survives the delivery process.
    Of course, this isn’t a new problem: in the past, traditional software development
    teams would throw their work “over the wall” to the operations team to serve in
    production with little to no context. A community effort to solve the inevitable
    mess resulted in what we now think of as DevOps, removing the wall between development
    and operations to drive increased efficiency and improve product quality. New
    tools and processes to help teams implement streamlined delivery pipelines now
    help guarantee development/production parity.'

  zh: 让我们深入了解一下这里发生了什么：
- en: 1\. The ML base development image was pulled down to your local machine from
    Docker Hub. This includes many of the commonly used data science and ML libraries
    pre-installed, along with a Jupyter Notebook server with useful extensions installed
    and configured.
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 1\. ML基础开发镜像已从Docker Hub拉取到你的本地机器。这包括许多常用的数据科学和ML库的预安装，以及安装和配置了有用扩展的Jupyter
    Notebook服务器。
- en: 2\. A container is launched with the base image, and is configured to mount
    your top-level project directory as a shared volume on the container. This lets
    you use your preferred IDE on your host machine to modify code and see changes
    reflected immediately in the runtime environment.
  id: totrans-36
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 2\. 容器是用基础镜像启动的，并配置为将你的顶级项目目录挂载为容器上的共享卷。这允许你在主机上使用你喜欢的IDE来修改代码，并立即在运行时环境中看到更改。
- en: 3\. Port forwarding is set up so you can use a browser on your host machine
    to work with the notebook server running inside the container. An appropriate
    host port to forward is dynamically chosen, so no worries about port conflicts
    (e.g., other notebook servers, databases, or anything else running on your laptop).
  id: totrans-37
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 3\. 端口转发已设置好，以便你可以使用主机上的浏览器来访问容器内运行的笔记本服务器。合适的主机端口会被动态选择，所以无需担心端口冲突（例如，其他笔记本服务器、数据库或任何其他在你笔记本电脑上运行的服务）。
- en: 4\. The project is scaffolded with its own Dockerfile, so you can install any
    project-specific packages or libraries and share your environment with the team
    via source control.
  id: totrans-38
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 4\. 项目通过自己的Dockerfile进行脚手架搭建，因此你可以安装任何项目特定的包或库，并通过源代码控制与团队共享你的环境。
- en: You can use your favorite browser and IDE locally as you normally would to do
    your work, while your runtime environment is 100% consistent across your team.
    If you are working on multiple projects on your machine, rest assured that each
    project is running in its own cleanly isolated container.

    you need to make sure your team is set up for success. We need what the DevOps
    movement did for software engineering in the ML delivery pipeline. Moving to a
    Docker-first development workflow is a great first step in making life easier
    for everyone involved with the delivery pipeline—and that includes your customers.
