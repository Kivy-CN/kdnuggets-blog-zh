- en: Jupyter has become a defacto platform for many of us due to its simple design,
    interactivity benefits and cross-language support all in one place. There are
    other ways to use a notebook environment but none so far I have seen offer so
    many benefits than Jupyter.
  prefs: []

- en: I say Jupyter because previously there was only Jupyter Notebooks but now there's
    Jupyter Lab as well and other notebook environments based on Jupyter.

    experience).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Install nb-extensions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**This is the basis for efficient reporting in Jupyter**'
  prefs: []

    the Javascript and CSS files that are also needed.

    environment and navigate to the tab.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can enable an interactive TOC and one which will appear at the very top
    of your notebook. The interactive version will appear on the left side of your
    screen by default but can then be moved to another part of your notebook if you
    wish.

  prefs:

    are:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This goes hand-in-hand with markdown and the Table of Contents. As can be seen
    in the above image, adding headings with markdown in Jupyter will automatically
    section it and add it to he list of contents making it easier for the user to
    scroll and locate whatever they want.

    equations rendered on their notebook.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using this extension allows us to reduce non essential code that would otherwise
    end up in the notebook. If you need to verify anything from previous output, you
    can just type it into the Scratchpad and it will not end up in the notebook
