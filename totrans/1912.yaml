    behaviour.Customers these days are dependent on recommendations whether it is
    for products to purchase, news on recent launches, restaurants to visit or services
    to avail. Most of the ecommerce websites like [Walmart](http://www.dezyre.com/article/how-big-data-analysis-helped-increase-walmart-s-sales-turnover/109

    the products; learn the tastes of customers to predict the needs of customers.
    Data science algorithms help in personalizing customer experience by changing
    the gallery pages for a specific customer or by changing the order of products

    in the right place at the right time. In ecommerce or any retail business, some
    products might have a very short demand window  (think of customised “Merry Christmas
    2014” products on Jan 1, 2015) and if the business misses that window for a given
    product they might end up piling up useless stock inventory in their warehouses.
    Data science algorithms perform detailed analysis to develop advanced predictive
    models that help ecommerce businesses optimize customer satisfaction, reduce the
    risk factor and inform strategy.
