    to listen and transcribe them? When I was still a student, I remember that I had
    to struggle every day with listening hours and hours of recorded lessons and most
    of my time was taken away from transcription. Furthermore, it wasn’t my native
    language and I had to drag every sentence into google translate to convert it
    into Italian.

    company for ChatGPT, OpenAI, launched Whisper API for speech-to-text conversation!
    With a few lines of Python code, you can call this powerful speech recognition
    model,  get the thought off of your mind and focus on other activities, like making
    practice with data science projects and improving your portfolio. Let’s get started!

- en: Whisper is a model based on neural networks developed by OpenAI to solve speech-to-text
    tasks. It belongs to the GPT-3 family and has become very popular for its ability
    to transcribe audio into text with very high accuracy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It doesn’t limit handling English, but its ability is extended to more than
    50 languages. If you are interested to understand if your language is included,
    check [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7031512-whisper-api-faq). Furthermore,
    it can translate any language audio into English.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like other OpenAI products, there is an API to get access to these speech recognition
    services, allowing developers and data scientists to integrate Whisper into their
    platforms and apps.

    go and log in to the [OpenAI API website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). If
    you still don’t have the account, you need to create it. After you entered, click
    on your username and press the option “View API keys”. Then, click the button
    “Create new API key” and copy the new create API key on your Python code.

    that helps students from all over the world to master technology and improve skills
    by learning tools, like Power BI, video editing and AI products. For example,
    let’s suppose that we would like to transcribe the video “3 Mind-blowing AI Tools”.

    Once there are all the python libraries installed, we just need to pass the URL
    of the video to the Youtube object. After, we get the highest resolution video
    stream and, then, download the video.

- en: That’s it! I hope that this tutorial has helped you on getting started with
    Whisper API. In this case study, it was applied with youtube videos, but you can
    also try podcasts, zoom calls and conferences. I found the outputs obtained after
    the transcription and the translation very impressive! This AI tool is surely
    helping a lot of people right now. The only limit is the fact that it’s only possible
    to translate to English text and not vice versa, but I am sure that OpenAI will
    provide it soon. Thanks for reading! Have a nice day!
