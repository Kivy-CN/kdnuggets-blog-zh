- en: We’re learning a lot about ChatGPT and large language models (LLMs). Natural
    Language Processing has been an interesting topic, a topic that is currently taking
    the AI and tech world by storm. Yes, LLMs like ChatGPT have helped their growth,
    but wouldn’t it be good to understand where it all comes from? So let’s go back
    to the basics - NLP.

    to detect and understand human language, through speech and text just the way
    we humans can. NLP helps models process, understand and output the human language.

- en: The goal of NLP is to bridge the communication gap between humans and computers.
    NLP models are typically trained on tasks such as next word prediction which allow
    them to build contextual dependencies and then be able to generate relevant outputs.

    elements, characteristics and structure of the human language. Think about the
    times you tried to learn a new language, you had to understand different elements
    of it. Or if you haven’t tried learning a new language, maybe going to the gym
    and learning how to squat - you have to learn the elements of having good form.

    you will need to standardize it. Standardizing data is when you convert data into
    a format that computers can easily understand and use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same applies to NLP. Text normalization is the process of cleaning and standardizing
    text data into a consistent formation. You will want a format that doesn’t have
    a lot or if any variations and noise. This makes it easier for NLP models to analyze
    and process the language more effectively and accurately.

- en: Before you can ingest anything into your NLP model, you need to understand computers
    and understand that they only understand numbers. Therefore, when you have text
    data, you will need to use text vectorization to transform the text into a format
    that the machine learning model can understand.

- en: Once the text data is vectorised in a format the machine can understand, the
    NLP machine learning algorithm is then fed training data. This training data helps
    the NLP model to understand the data, learn patterns, and make relationships about
    the input data.

    base, which contains characteristics of the text, different features, and more.
    It’s basically a part of their brain that has learnt and stored new information.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more data fed into these NLP models during the training phase, the more
    accurate the model will be. Once the model has gone through the training phase,
    it will then be put to the test through the testing phase. During the testing
    phase, you will see how accurately the model can predict outcomes using unseen
    data. Unseen data is new data to the model, therefore it has to use its knowledge
    base to make predictions.
