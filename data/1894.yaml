- en: 2012 was a big year in Great Britain. The country was awash with national pride.
    Union Jacks proudly flying at full mast across most British streets and a feverish
    party atmosphere, as we hosted arguably the best ever Olympic Games. During the
    games, we witnessed the prominent rise and rightful public recognition of the
    athleticism of disabled athletes, competing in the Paralympics and Special Olympics.
    Tanni Grey-Thompson, Ellie Simmonds and Lee Pearson are now just as likely to
    be debated as Britain’s best Olympians from those games, alongside Mo Farah and
    Bradley Wiggins, amongst friends down the pub. Whatever stigma previously existed
    was smashed to bits, as our heroic athletes brought home gold medal after gold
    medal.

- en: One of the areas where Machine Learning is playing a prominent role, is the
    support of people suffering with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is a condition
    suffered by approximately 1 in every 100 people, with men more likely to be diagnosed
    with the condition than women. It affects children at around age 3, and results
    in the child having difficulty processing or engaging in human interaction or
    emotion, which can make integrating into groups of other children very difficult.
    However, the London Knowledge Lab was incredibly successful in introducing a group
    of ASD children to a virtual autonomous robot called Andy. The experiment found
    that the children interacted readily with Andy, listening intently, asking and
    answering questions far more freely than if it had been a human adult. Similarly,
    an artificial intelligence robot called Milo has been rolled out to over 50 schools
    in the United States to encourage children with ASD to interact more readily face
    to face, and in some cases, even permit physical contact from the robot, unthinkable
    for the majority of ASD sufferers. While there is no recognised cure for ASD at
    present, the experiment offers hope to the families of children and adults suffering
    with ASD, that they might one day be so comfortable conversing with artificial
    intelligence software that they might grow in confidence in their interactions
    with other people.

  zh: 机器学习在支持自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）患者方面发挥着重要作用。这种状况大约影响每100人中的1人，其中男性比女性更容易被诊断出此病。它在大约3岁时影响儿童，导致他们在处理或参与人际互动或情感方面遇到困难，这使得融入其他儿童的群体非常困难。然而，伦敦知识实验室在将一组ASD儿童引入一款名为Andy的虚拟自主机器人方面取得了巨大成功。实验发现，儿童们与Andy互动非常积极，专心倾听，问答交流比与成年人更为自如。类似地，一款名为Milo的人工智能机器人已经在美国50多所学校推广，鼓励ASD儿童更加愿意面对面互动，在某些情况下，甚至允许与机器人进行身体接触，这是大多数ASD患者难以想象的。虽然目前没有公认的ASD治疗方法，但该实验为ASD儿童及成人的家庭带来了希望，期待他们有一天能够自如地与人工智能软件交谈，从而提升与他人互动的信心。
- en: 'Intelligent prosthetics is another area in which Data Science has been implemented
    in order to make the lives of disabled people easier. For many amputees or people
    living without the use of one or more limbs, the options are very limited, and
    often very rudimentary, focusing on bare essential rather than everyday usability.
    However, Deka Research, headed up by Segway inventor Dean Kamen, have pioneered
    a prosthesis they call the ‘Luke’ arm (named in tribute after Luke Skywalker).
    The unique aspect of this piece of technology is that its modelled more closely
    on the internal workings of a human arm, with the mechanical equivalent of tendons,
    muscles and bones allowing the user a much more natural range of motion, closer
    to a human arm than to the hooks and claws that have been more prevalent in the
    last 20 years. The arm itself can be controlled in several ways: with microscopic
    nerve endings attached to the base of the arm, or controllers in the wearer’s
    shoes. The project was granted a significant financial boost by the US Army Research
    Office, but the prostheses are likely to still be incredibly expensive to produce
    on a mass scale, with some estimates at around the $50,000 mark. While this may
    not be the answer for everyone who needs a prosthetic, the range of movement and
    sophistication of technology on show here is a brilliant sign for the future,
    when similar technologies will be available for less cost, and potentially with
    even more uses.'

  zh: 智能假肢是数据科学应用的另一个领域，旨在使残疾人的生活更加便捷。对于许多截肢者或失去一个或多个肢体功能的人来说，选择非常有限，而且通常非常原始，关注基本功能而非日常可用性。然而，由赛格威发明人Dean
    Kamen领导的Deka研究公司，首创了一款名为“Luke”臂的假肢（以致敬卢克·天行者命名）。这一技术的独特之处在于它更接近于人手内部的工作原理，机械等效的肌腱、肌肉和骨骼使用户具有更自然的运动范围，比过去20年更常见的钩子和爪子要接近人类手臂。该臂可以通过多种方式控制：通过附着在臂基部的微小神经末梢，或通过佩戴者鞋中的控制器。该项目获得了美国陆军研究办公室的显著资金支持，但大规模生产的假肢仍可能极为昂贵，有些估算约在50,000美元左右。尽管这可能不是每个需要假肢的人都能接受的答案，但这里展示的运动范围和技术复杂性为未来的类似技术带来了光明前景，届时可能会以更低的成本提供，并具有更多用途。
- en: A piece of technology that was brought to prominence by one of the world’s most
    famous scientists, Professor Stephen Hawking, the electronic augmentative and
    alternative communication system (AAC) has become integral to the lives of those
    people who are unable to speak due to conditions such as motor neurone disease
    or cerebral palsy. One of the latest innovations in this market, and still closely
    related to the ‘Equaliser’ device used by Hawking from 1986 onwards, is the DynaVox
    EyeMax. This device uses Computer Vision techniques, via a front-facing camera
    to track the movements of the user’s eyes across the screen of commands, and can
    even be programmed to use certain intonation in order for the speech to not be
    misconstrued. It has the potential to use Natural Language Processing to give
    speech to a large number of people who may have lost the ability, but there are
    some limitations to the technology; each device must be individually programmed
    for the respective user, to include places of interest, names of friends and family
    and other unique information, and the cost of the devices is not often covered
    by health insurance. It is expected however that the inclusion of deep learning
    technology into the devices in future should reduce the time taken to program
    the device, which could bring the cost of the devices down to a more affordable
    level.

  zh: 由世界上最著名的科学家之一斯蒂芬·霍金教授带到显著位置的技术——电子增强和替代通信系统（AAC）已成为那些由于运动神经元病或脑瘫等疾病而无法说话的人的生活中不可或缺的一部分。在这个市场上的最新创新之一，仍然与霍金自1986年起使用的‘Equaliser’设备紧密相关的是DynaVox
    EyeMax。该设备利用计算机视觉技术，通过前置摄像头跟踪用户眼睛在命令屏幕上的运动，甚至可以编程使用特定的语调以防止言语被误解。它有潜力利用自然语言处理为许多失去语言能力的人提供发言功能，但该技术也有一些限制；每个设备必须为各自的用户单独编程，包括兴趣地点、朋友和家人的名字及其他独特信息，并且设备的费用通常不被健康保险覆盖。然而，预计未来将深度学习技术融入设备中应能减少编程所需的时间，这可能会使设备的成本降至更实惠的水平。
- en: It is not only specialist medical firms who have seen the value, both financially
    and philanthropically, of using data science technologies to improve the lives
    of disabled people. Google recently announced that they were looking to boost
    the accessibility of their smartphones and other devices for users who might have
    limited or no use of their sight, hearing or dexterity. One of the most exciting
    and unique developments is a Braille system for use with Google smartphones, which
    allows users to connect a Braille device to their phone via Bluetooth. In addition,
    Android systems can now be controlled by ‘switches’, not dissimilar to those used
    by Stephen Hawking in his wheelchair. This, according to Google, opens them up
    to a new group of users who previously would not have been able to access this
    technology, and allows users to use the same hardware as their friends rather
    than having something custom-made and potentially less appealing. There is a huge
    financial incentive to these developments, as both Switch Access and BrailleBack
    are free to download for Android, meaning that unlike many technologies designed
    for the disabled community, price does not have to be a barrier. Overall, Google’s
    contribution has laid down a benchmark for other technology companies to follow
    their lead in producing affordable and easy-to-use platforms for those with disabilities,
    and we look forward to see who steps up next.

  zh: 不仅仅是专业医疗公司认识到利用数据科学技术改善残疾人生活的财务和慈善价值。谷歌最近宣布，他们希望提升其智能手机和其他设备的可访问性，以帮助那些视力、听力或灵活性受限的用户。一个令人兴奋且独特的发展是为谷歌智能手机设计的盲文系统，它允许用户通过蓝牙将盲文设备连接到手机上。此外，Android系统现在可以通过类似于斯蒂芬·霍金在轮椅上使用的‘开关’来控制。根据谷歌的说法，这为以前无法访问这些技术的新用户群体打开了大门，并允许用户使用与朋友相同的硬件，而不是使用定制的、可能不那么吸引人的设备。这些发展具有巨大的财务激励，因为Switch
    Access和BrailleBack都可以免费从Android上下载，这意味着与许多为残疾群体设计的技术不同，价格不再是障碍。总体而言，谷歌的贡献为其他技术公司树立了一个基准，促使他们跟随其在为残疾人士生产负担得起且易于使用的平台方面的领导，我们期待看到下一步是谁。
- en: Finally, there is something that is definitely more at the ‘proof of concept’
    stage right now, but shows enormous potential for the future. In 2011 Dr Dennis
    Hong, from Virginia Tech University’s RoMeLa Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory,
    pioneered a car that was designed for blind or partially-sighted people to be
    able to drive independently. Using a system that combined machine learning software
    that was able to learn a pre-determined route and sense obstacles and pedestrians,
    and a series of sensors packed into pressure-pad gloves, that would tell the driver
    where they should be going and if there was an impeding obstacle that needed to
    be avoided. During his TED talk in the same year, Dr Hong demonstrated the car
    with a blind person driving, doing a whole lap of a pre-determined course safely
    at the Daytona Speedway. It must be noted that there are a few reasons why this
    system could not be implemented immediately, least of which is that the route
    had to be meticulously entered into the car’s computer in order for the sensors
    to direct the driver, and this would not be feasible for every road. However,
    it shows enormous progress in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning,
    and a huge leap forward for the blind and partially sighted community as a whole.

  zh: 最后，有些东西目前确实更处于“概念验证”阶段，但对未来展现了巨大的潜力。2011年，来自维吉尼亚理工大学RoMeLa机器人与机制实验室的Dennis Hong博士首创了一款设计用于让盲人或视力部分受损的人能够独立驾驶的汽车。该系统结合了能够学习预定路线并感知障碍物和行人的机器学习软件，以及一系列集成在压力垫手套中的传感器，能够告诉驾驶员他们应该去哪里，以及是否有需要避免的障碍物。在同年TED演讲中，Hong博士展示了这款汽车，一名盲人在Daytona
    Speedway安全地完成了整个预定路线的驾驶。必须指出的是，有几个原因导致该系统无法立即实施，最少的是需要将路线精确输入到汽车的计算机中，以便传感器能够指导驾驶员，而这对每条道路来说并不现实。然而，它在数据科学和机器学习领域显示了巨大的进展，对盲人和部分视力受损群体来说是一个巨大的飞跃。
- en: There are several questions that must be addressed before the relationship between
    Data Science and Disability can be labelled a success. Firstly, are the technological
    innovations that are beginning to emerge at an advanced enough stage to benefit
    those who are suffering from a disability now, or is the real breakthrough likely
    to come in 5-10 years? Similarly, are these options all financially viable, not
    for the producer, but for the consumer, who might only have limited income as
    a result of their income? Furthermore, are innovations offered by Data Science
    limited to making the lives of disabled people easier, or is there scope, for
    example, for deep learning being used to identify the genes that cause certain
    disabilities, giving doctors the chance to study and limit the genes in the future?
