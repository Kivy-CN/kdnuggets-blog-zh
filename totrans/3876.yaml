    web-based user interface for Project Jupyter," both inline with, and a step-up
    from, Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter''s web-based IDEs have been around for a number
    of years at this point, and they enjoy a remarkable foothold in the data science
    community, where, combined, they are the [most popular IDE](/2020/10/most-popular-python-ides-editors.html)

- en: More easily navigate a Jupyter document with the table of contents feature which
    is included in version 3\. It is automatically generated from headings in the
    Jupyter document, and can be toggled on and off on the left hand side of the interface.
    This makes jumping around longer documents much easier, and keeps related code
    and documentation neatly tucked away until needed.

    or bundled into existing packages with Jupyter Server extensions and Classic Notebook
    extensions. This helps make the ecosystem as a whole more coherent.

    notebooks with one installation; no additional steps necessary for configuration
    in one or the other.
