    cloud to deploy intelligent apps at scale, thanks to three machine learning trends: **data

    Summit, hosted by [Madrona Venture Group](http://www.madrona.com/)* last month
    in Seattle, where more than 100 experts, researchers, and journalists converged
    to discuss the future of artificial intelligence, trends in machine learning,
