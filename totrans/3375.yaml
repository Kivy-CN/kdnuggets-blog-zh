- en: The first category, **supervised learning**, is the one you may be most familiar
    with. It relies on the idea of creating a function or model based on a set of
    training data, which contains inputs and their corresponding labels. Convolutional
    Neural Networks are a great example of this, as the images are the inputs and
    the outputs are the classifications of the images (dog, cat, etc).

- en: '**Reinforcement learning** is the task of learning what actions to take, given
    a certain situation/environment, so as to maximize a reward signal. The interesting
    difference between supervised and reinforcement learning is that this reward signal
    simply tells you whether the action (or input) that the agent takes is good or
    bad. It doesn’t tell you anything about what the *best* action is. Contrast this
    to CNNs where the corresponding label for each image input is a definite instruction
    of what the output should be for each input.  Another unique component of RL is
    that an agent’s actions will affect the subsequent data it receives. For example,
    an agent’s action of moving left instead of right means that the agent will receive
    different input from the environment at the next time step. Let’s look at an example
    to start off.'

    imagine a tiny robot in a small room. We haven’t programmed this robot to move
    or walk or take any action. It’s just standing there. This robot is our **agent**.

- en: Like we mentioned before, reinforcement learning is all about trying to understand
    the optimal way of making decisions/actions so that we maximize some **reward** **R**.
    This reward is a feedback signal that just indicates how well the agent is doing
    at a given time step. The **action A** that an agent takes at every time step
    is a function of both the reward (signal telling the agent how well it’s currently
    doing) and the **state S**, which is a description of the environment the agent
    is in. The mapping from environment states to actions is called our **policy P**.
    The policy basically defines the agent’s way of behaving at a certain time, given
    a certain situation. Now, we also have a **value function V** which is a measure
    of how good each position is. This is different from the reward in that the reward
    signal indicates what is good in the immediate sense, while the value function
    is more indicative of how good it is to be in this state/position in the long
    run. Finally, we also have a **model M** which is the agent’s representation of
    the environment. This is the agent’s model of how it thinks that the environment
    is going to behave.

- en: So, let’s now think back to our robot (the agent) in the small room. Our **reward
    function** is dependent on what we want the agent to accomplish. Let’s say that
    we want it to move to one of the corners of the room where it will receive a reward.
    The robot will get a +25 when it reaches this point, and will get a -1 for every
    time step it takes to get there. We basically want the robot to get the corner
    as fast as possible. The **actions** the agent can take are moving north, south,
    east, or west. The agent’s **policy** can be a simple one, where the behavior
    is that the agent will always move to the location with the higher value function.
    Makes sense right? A position with a high value function = good to be in this
    position (with regards to long term reward).
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, this whole RL environment can be described with a **Markov Decision Process**.
    For those that haven’t heard the term before, an MDP is a framework for modeling
    an agent’s decision making. It contains a finite set of states (and value functions
    for those states), a finite set of actions, a policy, and a reward function. Our
    value function can be split into 2 terms.

    which means that the reward at time step 10 is weighted a little less than the
    reward at time step 1).'

- en: Now that we have all the components, what do we do with this MDP? Well, we want
    to solve it, of course. By solving an MDP, you’ll be able to find the optimal
    behavior (policy) that maximizes the amount of reward the agent can expect to
    get from any state in the environment.

    and specifically through the use of **policy iteration **(there is another technique
    called value iteration, but won’t go into that right now). The idea is that we
    take some initial policy π1 and evaluate the state value function for that policy.
    The way we do this is through the **Bellman expectation equation**.

    policy π, can be decomposed into the expected return sum of the immediate reward
    Rt+1 and the value function of the successor state St+1\. If you think about it
    closely, this is equivalent to the value function definition we used in the previous
    section. Using this equation is our **policy evaluation**component. In order to
    get a better policy, we use a **policy **improvement step where we simply act
    greedily with respect to the value function. In other words, the agent takes the
    action that maximizes value.

- en: Policy iteration is great and all, but it only works when we have a given MDP.
    The MDP essentially tells you how the environment works, which realistically is
    not going to be given in real world scenarios. When not given an MDP, we use model
    free methods that go directly from the experience/interactions of the agents and
    the environment to the value functions and policies. We’re going to be doing the
    same steps of policy evaluation and policy improvement, just without the information
    given by the MDP.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way we do this is instead of improving our policy by optimizing over the
    state value function, we’re going to optimize over the action value function Q.
    Remember how we decomposed the state value function into the sum of immediate
    reward and value function of the successor state? Well, we can do the same with
    our Q function.

    improvement, except we replace our state value function V with our action value
    function Q. Now, I’m going to skip over the details of what changes with the evaluation/improvement
    steps. To understand MDP free evaluation and improvement methods, topics such
    as Monte Carlo Learning, Temporal Difference Learning, and SARSA would require
    whole blogs just themselves (If you are interested, though, please take a listen
    to David Silver’s [Lecture 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnHCvfgC_ZA) and [Lecture
    5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g4j2k_Ggc4)). Right now, however, I’m going
    to jump ahead to value function approximation and the methods discussed in the
    AlphaGo and Atari Papers, and hopefully that should give a taste of modern RL
    techniques. **The main takeaway is that we want to find the optimal policy π* that
    maximizes our action value function Q.**

- en: So, if you think about everything we’ve learned up until this point, we’ve treated
    our problem in a relatively simplistic way. Look at the above Q equation. We’re
    taking in a specific state S and action A, and then computing a number that basically
    tells us what the expected return is. Now let’s imagine that our agent moves 1
    millimeter to the right. This means we have a whole new state S’, and now we’re
    going to have to compute a Q value for that. In real world RL problems, there
    are millions and millions of states so it’s important that our value functions
    understand generalization in that we don’t have to store a completely separate
    value function for every possible state. The solution is to use a **Q value function
    approximation **that is able to generalize to unknown states.

    of the Q value given some state S and some action A.

    you see that W, you already know we’re bringing in some gradient descent *). It
    is going to compute the dot product between x (which is just a feature vector
    that represents S and A) and W. The way we’re going to improve this function is
    by calculating the loss between the true Q value (let’s just assume that it’s
    given to us for now) and the output of the approximate function.*

  id: totrans-45

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before getting to the papers, just wanted to touch on one last thing. An interesting
    discussion with the topic of reinforcement learning is that of exploration vs
    exploitation. **Exploitation** is the agent’s process of taking what it already
    knows, and then making the actions that it knows will produce the maximum reward.
    This sounds great, right? The agent will always be making the best action based
    on its current knowledge. However, there is a key phrase in that statement. *Current
    knowledge*. If the agent hasn’t explored enough of the state space, it can’t possibly
    know whether it is really taking the best possible action. This idea of taking
    actions with the main purpose of exploring the state space is called **exploration**.
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This idea can be easily related to a real world example. Let’s say you have
    a choice of what restaurant to eat at tonight. You (acting as the agent) know
    that you like Mexican food, so in RL terms, going to a Mexican restaurant will
    be the action that maximizes your reward, or happiness/satisfaction in this case.
    However, there is also a choice of Italian food, which you’ve never had before.
    There’s a possibility that it could be better than Mexican food, or could be a
    lot worse. This tradeoff between whether to exploit an agent’s past knowledge
    vs trying something new in hope of discovering a greater reward is one of the
    major challenges in reinforcement learning (and in our daily lives tbh).
