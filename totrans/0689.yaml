- en: YouTube contains a great many videos on the topic of Machine Learning, but it
    can be hard to figure out what's worth watching, especially since 300 hours of
    video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. Here we bring you the most popular
    recent Machine Learning videos worth watching. This post updates a previous very
    popular post [Top 10 Machine Learning Videos on YouTube](/2015/06/top-10-machine-learning-videos-youtube.html)
    from 2015.  We also added a few top relevant playlists.

    how machine learning can be applied to video games. This is achieved using neural
    networks and genetic algorithms. What''s really great about this video is how
    the author concisely describes how the neural network acts to achieve the given
    performance. Having played Super Mario World myself, I can say the gameplay is
    extremely impressive, learned or not!'

    2010). In this lecture, Patrick Winston (Instructor) showed support vector machines
    in some mathematical detail. He used Lagrange multipliers to maximize the width
    of the street given certain constraints. If needed, we transform vectors into
    another space, using a kernel function.
