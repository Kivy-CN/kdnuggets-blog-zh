    can have conversations with machines has tantalized the human imagination. A lot
    of us have grown up watching movies about highly knowledgeable machines/robots
    in science fiction narratives.

- en: Sci-fi was very popular when I was growing up, and I’m not sure if it’s because
    we subconsciously knew that we were getting closer to the point that this could
    be reality. Who knows! But we’re here, so let’s talk about it.

    hand, sometimes it went completely wrong for example I, Robot. But we can’t deny
    that we were engaged. It not only offered us entertainment, but it pushed the
    human brain to delve into deeper questions about the portrayal of artificial intelligence.

    of AI but also the ethical challenges that AI has in the real world.'

    remarkable to watch. Let’s take it back to [ELIZA](https://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm),
    an early natural language processing computer program which was created between
    the years 1964 to 1967 at MIT by [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum).
    ELIZA is your computer therapist that emulates a Rogerian psychotherapist. If
    you haven’t already, I’ll advise you to [try it out](https://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm)
    and ask ChatGPT the same questions, it’s quite comical.

    who sometimes didn’t understand what we were saying. We’ve come a long way since

    processing (NLP) which have shown high performance due to the use of a variety
    of datasets, increase and development of hardware and more. We are now living
    in the large language model (LLM) era, where models such as [ChatGPT and Google
    Bard](/chatgpt-vs-bard) have shown impressive human-like conversation.

    ChatGPT stands at the forefront. It provides quick responses which can be fine
    tuned to your preference. It’s not just an AI tool, it is also a collaborator.
    It can deal with a variety of tasks such as creative logo designs, text improvement
    and generation as well as educational material.

    adjusts its response based on this. But with all great things come limitations.

    needs to overcome certain challenges to converse like a human. As I mentioned
    before, we’re not at the end of the tunnel and researchers and organizations are
    working on how to overcome these challenges. LLMs face a lot of ethical challenges
    such as job displacement, privacy, data security, etc.
