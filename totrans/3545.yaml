    success of its Hadoop-based Azure HDInsight and PowerBI for Office 365, Microsoft
    took yet another step towards market leadership in Big Data through the public
    preview release of Azure Machine Learning (also known as "Azure ML"). Taking the
    predictive analytics to public cloud seems like the next logical step towards
    large-scale consumerization of Machine Learning. Azure ML does just that, while
    making it significantly easier for the developers. The service runs on Azure public
    cloud, which means that users need not buy any hardware or software; and also,
    need not worry about deployment and maintenance.'

- en: Through an integrated development environment called ML Studio, people without
    data science background can also build data models through drag-and-drop gestures
    and simple data flow diagrams. This not only minimizes coding, but also saves
    a lot of time through ML Studio's library of sample experiments. On the other
    hand, seasoned data scientists will be glad to notice how strongly Azure ML supports
    R. You can just drop existing R code directly into Azure ML, or develop your own
    code using more than 350 R packages supported by ML Studio. ![Azure ML](../Images/cb09edb847d8def483d8e1ffe62ce384.png)
    Azure ML is built on top of the machine learning capabilities of several Microsoft
    products and services. It shares many of the real-time predictive analytics of
    the new personal assistant in Windows Phone called Cortana. Azure ML also uses
    proven solutions from Xbox and Bing. Outshining Nate Silver's lauded FiveThirtyEight
    blog, Bing Predicts recently astonished many by [correctly forecasting the results
    of more than 95% of the US mid-term elections](https://blogs.bing.com/blog/2014/11/10/bing-gets-an-a-in-election-prediction-accuracy/).
    Thus, it might be worth checking out Azure ML to see what its powerful cloud-based
    predictive analytics can do for you.

    was being compared to IBM's Watson. In his keynote, [Joseph Sirosh](/2014/11/interview-joseph-sirosh-microsoft-azure-machine-learning.html),
    Microsoft CVP of Machine Learning, announced [new machine learning capabilities
    for Azure Marketplace](http://blogs.technet.com/b/machinelearning/archive/2014/10/16/web-services-and-marketplaces-create-a-new-data-science-economy.aspx),
    which has evolved significantly over the last few years (since its launch in October
    2010). Azure Marketplace hosts various exciting APIs that use ML, including the
    Bing Speech Recognition Control, Microsoft Translator, Bing Synonyms API and Bing
    Search API. As of today, Azure Marketplace has 25+ machine learning APIs.

    Marketplace is a convenient platform for data scientists to build custom web services,
    publish APIs and charge for its usage. Azure ML users can search for these APIs
    and subscribe to them. Thus, along with other Analytics Marketplaces, Azure Marketplace
    is another good platform for data scientists to monetize their expertise and creativity,
    very similar to how developers do on iOS or Android app stores. ![Microsoft Azure
    Machine Learning](../Images/260f928aca246def8348fa62d971f306.png) In the efforts
    to boost the adoption of the still new Azure ML service, Microsoft has taken several
    steps to make it easier for people to try it. Recently, Microsoft executives at
    the PASS Summit in Seattle, announced a free tier of access to Azure ML (i.e.
    now you can try Azure ML without providing any credit card information). This
    has encouraged DBAs, developers, BI professionals and amateur data scientists
    to try Azure ML for building models to incorporate into applications. Besides,
    Microsoft also launched the [Microsoft Azure for Research Award Program](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/azure/ml.aspx)
    offering research grants to both seasoned researchers and students to try Azure
    ML.'
