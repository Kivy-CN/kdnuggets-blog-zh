    definition of Generative AI. [Generative AI](/2023/05/future-ai-exploring-next-generation-generative-models.html)
    can generate text, images, or other forms of media based on user prompts. It can
    produce new content, replace repetitive tasks, work on customized data, and more.
    For example, [PandasAI](/2023/05/pandas-ai-generative-ai-python-library.html)
    was released not long ago - a generative AI python library which integrates generative
    AI capabilities into Pandas for simpler data analysis.
