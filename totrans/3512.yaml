- en: There are obviously a number of ways to go about learning machine learning,
    with books, courses, and degree programs all being great places to start. Like
    any number of topics a newcomer may delve into, however, there are a vast number
    of options in each of these categories, and attempting to narrow one's focus alone
    can often prove futile.

- en: A Quora post, aptly titled '[How Do I Learn Machine Learning?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1),'
    ends up being a robust resource. The FAQ has generated a lot of attention during
    the course of its life, with 93 answers and more than 468,000 views, and has contributions
    from a number of well-known personalities in the machine learning world. The idea
    of learning from others whom have previously undertaken the same task has special
    significance for the learning of machine learning.

    Also keep in mind that, in contrast with many of the other educational resources
    on this site, this post deals solely with machine learning, and while a prominent
    component of data science, this advice is more narrowly-focused than some of the
    other data science learning materials.
