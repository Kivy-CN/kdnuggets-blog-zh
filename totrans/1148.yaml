    the main difference between a data analyst and a data scientist? Are they the
    same job? Which job, data analyst or data scientist, pays a higher salary? How
    do you science data anyway?

    Review called it the sexiest job of the decade. Data analysts received no such
    claim.

- en: The main difference between data analysts and data scientists lies in what they
    do with the data in both of their job titles. A data analyst does what the name
    implies - she looks at data, tries to predict trends, makes visualizations, and
    communicates the results. In other words, data analysts analyze data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The job description of a data scientist can be a little harder to pin down since
    you can't exactly science data the way you can analyze it. However, we can safely
    say that data scientists are responsible for designing and constructing new models
    for data. They create prototypes, algorithms, predictive models.

    scientist! For example, data analysts and data scientists both spend a huge proportion
    of their time getting the data in a fit state to either analyze or science.

    into the nitty-gritty differences between a data analyst versus a data scientist
    with the aim of helping you decide which one is best for you. I'll cover the typical
    background, what it's like to work in these fields, what skills and tools you'll
    need, and ultimately how to choose which one works best for you.

    scientist job versus a data analyst job. I conducted the highly scientific approach
    of Googling data scientist job descriptions and data analyst job descriptions
    and found the differences are more or less what you'd expect from the titles.
  prefs: []

- en: A data scientist’s job description typically involves machine learning, algorithms,
    and automation. Most job descriptions for a data scientist also include using
    visualization tools and statistical techniques to identify patterns in data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data analyst job description, meanwhile, is typically to conduct analyses
    and develop visualizations from data. The main responsibility is communicating
    with other teams at the company to create insights from data. if you're paying
    attention you'll realize that that sounds an awful lot like the latter half of
    the data scientist job description.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to stakeholders; data scientists versus data analysts just do a little extra around
    creating the methods to discover those insights.

    emails, and creating models. Andriy Burkov, Global ML Team Leader at Gartner, [says](/2017/11/day-life-data-scientist.html) that
    he also helps team members improve current models and training examples to fix
    problems in those models. It also involves a lot of cleaning data.

    that “Data science is about solving problems, not models or algorithms,” so keep
    that in mind as we get into the data analyst’s day-to-day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compared to a data scientist, a data analyst’s day-to-day is remarkably similar.
    Like data science, a huge responsibility in a data analyst’s job is communicating
    results. That means that a lot of a data analyst’s day is taken up with meetings,
    emails, checking up with other teams, and reviewing current project statuses.
    The main task is to gather, clean, and study data to help solve problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Is that data scientists are expected to create and maintain models. Other than
    that, the days look very alike.

    data analyst jobs will see a 20% growth from 2018 to 2028 which is apparently
    faster than average. This is attributed to the need for better market research
    in a bunch of different industries. Data analysts can expect to find jobs in IT,
    healthcare, finance, and insurance industries. The average salary in the US is
    $70,000 for a data analyst. The highest potential salary for a data analyst is
    in North Carolina, which is actually $85,000 a year.

    data science job growth is equally promising as data analyst job growth. IBM predicted
    that the demand for data scientists would surge by 28% in 2020; the Bureau of

    and has projected 31% growth over the next 10 years.

    versus a data scientist. Many data analysts aspire to become data scientists later
    in their careers. Don't think of a data scientist as an entry-level job - Plenty

    the skills required to be a data scientist are interdisciplinary communication,
    big picture energy, and a business sense and customer orientation. Most companies
    will need a similar set of requirements. You should also be able to build models
    that predict future trends.

    For many data analysts, a typical career path involves climbing the ladder to
    a mid-level or senior data analyst position, maybe specializing in a specific
    area of the company's data strategy. Many data analysts eventually become data
    scientists as I alluded to above.

    These do the same thing as a regular data analyst but for a variety of clients

    the data analysis career path are useful for a wide range of jobs.

    need at least two degrees, potentially three. By the time you become a data scientist,
    most people are pretty sure that's what they want to do. However, there is room
    for growth. You can go the management path or the individual contributor path.
    In the individual contributor path, you'll be deepening and strengthening your
    skills in a very specific field of data science, becoming a bit of a specialist.
    As a data scientist in the management path, you'll instead take a step back and
    scale up. You'll be managing teams scaling data strategy and working with the
    data organization more holistically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These paths aren't necessarily linear. They overlap, diverge, and then come
    back together. There isn't any year-long requirement, either. You can be a data
    analyst for 3 years and then [become a data scientist](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist-from-scratch/) the
    year after; you can stay in your job as a data scientist for the next 20 years
    and not progress anywhere. It depends a lot more on the skills that you pick up
    along the way.

    it's best to become a data analyst for now. If you're already got a PhD in computer

    science.

    you probably have more education in the data field, which leads to a greater salary.

    scientist. Both are involved with cleaning data, analyzing data, presenting data,
    and influencing the business’s direction.
