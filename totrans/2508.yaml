    heavily on the functioning of machines and systems. Almost everything from a light
    switch to a smartphone, from an elevator to a car, is a machine or a system that
    controls a machine. However, any machine is subject to wear and tear.

    breaks down? This is precisely why there’s a dire need for [predictive maintenance
    with machine learning](https://marutitech.com/machine-learning-predictive-analytics/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s take the example of a taxi company to understand this. If you want the
    cars to keep running on schedule and not break-down during peak working hours,
    you’d want to ensure proper maintenance of all the moving parts. Generally, there
    are two thought processes when it comes to eradicating break-down or failure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can either be conservative about it and schedule periodic maintenance. In
    this case, you are less likely to have a complete understanding regarding the
    lifecycle of your machine and factors which realistically cause the break-down.
    This case is also likely to be more cost intensive since the process does not
    focus on extracting the maximum value from the machine before scheduling maintenance.
    So, for example, you’ll probably change the tires before they complete their life
    cycle and change the engine oil before it is thoroughly utilized. As a result,
    you’ll end up spending more on maintenance.

- en: The second thought process is to be calculative and base your decisions on predictive
    data analytics. Predictive maintenance uses machine learning to learn from historical
    data and use live data to analyze failure patterns. Since conservative procedures
    result in resource wastage, predictive maintenance using machine learning looks
    for optimum resource utilization and predicting failure before they happen. As
    a result, predictive maintenance avoids both extremes and looks to find the perfect
    middle ground.
  prefs: []

    do you use? In this article, we look at how you can find the right techniques
    that can be utilized, in order to successfully carry out predictive maintenance

- en: The first step should be to collect data. The machine or system whose failure
    is to be predicted needs to be monitored at all times. The data generated from
    the monitoring system will need to be segregated to understand the various conditions
    and factors affecting the machine. So, for example, to understand car engine failure,
    the sensors should record temperature, moisture, oil level, oil density, etc.
    This information will provide the impetus to track and predict the failure pattern
    and cause. Data for predictive maintenance is [time series data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series).

    task should be to recognize them and then locate the ones that we need to predict.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    happen over time, like in the case of brake-shoes gradual wear and tear or is
    it an acute problem, like engine water-logging?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the next step, we’ll need to identify which parts or processes are related
    to each type of failure. The different parameters which will elucidate information
    regarding the processes will need to be decided. Accordingly, monitoring mechanisms
    will have to be put in place to measure and track each parameter and the respective
    parts/processes.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the monitoring data needs to be collected over a long period to document the degradation
    process properly.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, it is advisable for data scientists and subject-matter experts to
    work jointly in collecting data. The subject-matter expertise is an integral part
    of understanding the machine and accordingly creating a schema for the data collection.
    Similarly, the data scientists need to be present in order to ensure that the
    data collected is useful and needs as minimal sanitation as possible.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    track data on their own. As a result, by the time the data scientists arrive,
    a significant amount of data has already been collected and restarting the data
    collection process could significantly set back the entire process.
  prefs: []

    or are we dependent on static data?
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    identify the markers quickly and allow the data scientists to filter the data
    in a short span of time. This data will be used to understand the indicators of
    the well-functioning machine as well as signs of a failure.
  prefs:

    failure? Is there any particular event that arises only before a process failure?
    What is the minimum period of time required as an advance warning?
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that we have the required information, we will move onto deciding which
    modeling technique will fit the data set best. The desired output and the available
    conditions will also be considered when deciding on the modeling technique. There
    are three main machine learning techniques which can be considered. Then based
    on fitment, one can take the final call.

    are needed. Each and every event needs to be labeled and logged. Numerous events
    of each type of failure are available in the dataset. This dataset is then used
    to train the model on how to predict possible failures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    predict the failure.
  prefs: []

    degradation process is gradual and not acute.
  prefs:

    different types of failures, then the behavior will change.
  prefs:

    a linear approach and use one model for every failure type. Every event is labeled
    and logged.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be extremely challenging to create a model that can accurately predict
    the lifetime of a machine. However, in reality, such a model is not needed. The
    maintenance team only needs to know if the machine will fail anytime soon. In
    order to do so, we can use the [classification model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) to
    predict a failure within the next ’N’ days or cycles (where N = any number).
  prefs: []

    It will also be dependent on labeled and tagged events. As a result, the data
    characteristics are the same as Technique 1.

    there are specific differences as listed below:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:

    train the model. It helps to understand the relationship between normal time characteristics
    and failure event characteristics. However, how many failure events is the company
    willing to digest in order to collect data? In the case of mission-critical systems,
    failure cases are limited. As a result, a different strategy needs to be adopted.
  prefs: []

    are not labeled and logged, or they are not available.

    data set and the difference between normal and failure event can be distinguished.

    needs to be handled according to the available situation. The first step should
    be to understand the system, the problems, the available condition surrounding
    the machine/system and then frame a model in accordance with the required result.
