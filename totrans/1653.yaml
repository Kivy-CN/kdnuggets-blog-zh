    in [Python](/2017/06/top-15-python-libraries-data-science.html) and [Scala](/2018/02/top-15-scala-libraries-data-science-2018.html).
    But this list of articles will not be complete without R. All of these programming
    languages are popular for different data science tasks and projects and have their
    supporters and opponents. So while we are arranging a comparison of how these
    programming languages relate to each other, we have prepared some of the most
    useful R libraries for data scientists and engineers, based on our experience.

- en: R is a well-known and increasingly popular tool in the Data Science field. It
    is a programming language and a software environment primarily designed for statistical
    computing, so its interface and structure are very well suited for the scientific
    tasks. Moreover, R has one of the most developed libraries systems that counts
    thousands of packages to solve a wide variety of problems.

- en: Although there are many general-purpose packages, we want to focus on those
    that provide sufficient capabilities for data manipulation, visualization, competitive
    research, and machine learning. Therefore, we have prepared an infographic of
    Top 20 R packages for data science, which covers the libraries main features and
    GitHub activities, as all of the libraries are open-source.

- en: Of course, this list of libraries is far from complete, but here we have collected
    the most generic and time-tested tools in our opinion. There are many other specific
    libraries that might be more efficient while solving particular tasks, so do not
    hesitate and share your thoughts and experience in the comment section.
