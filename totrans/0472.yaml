    attacks on networks and devices, people with AWS skills can go to contests that
    help them use their existing skills and learn new ones.

    an annual contest where data professionals use AWS to create new opportunities
    related to the game and its associated statistics.

    "We are extremely proud of the innovative ways the NFL and our partners continue
    to [use data and analytics to advance](https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-Announces-Fourth-Annual-Big-Data-Bowl-Powered-by-AWS.aspx)

    a customer still bears the responsibility of any AWS apps they develop and for
    training their team related to those tools. More specifically, companies must
    address common software vulnerabilities. Taking the time to earn AWS certifications
    can show employers you have up-to-date knowledge and are ready to apply it.

    People use cloud apps [to stay productive and collaborate](https://rehack.com/iot/apps/cloud-based-tools-for-a-productive-work-day/)
    with team members. Many of the systems used at departments that oversee policing,
    health care, transportation, and other essentials operate in the cloud. AWS offers
    digital badges you can [use to display your certifications](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/cloud-skills-are-in-demand-share-your-aws-certification-achievement/),

    professional. Although they don’t replace resumes, portfolios are good supplements
    because they let you showcase the visual aspects of projects.

    to build the portfolio. Then, you’re not only showing off your capabilities overall,
    but also specifically proving you can apply AWS expertise in meaningful ways.

    that help them grow. Although you can certainly learn on your own with enough
    dedication, it’s often even more valuable to gather with like-minded individuals.
    Swapping suggestions and advice lets you share what you know while absorbing the
    knowledge of others.

    people worldwide could join.

    out your AWS abilities and get employers interested. Rather than merely listing
    AWS as a bullet point in a section of tools and platforms you use, support your
    skills with helpful context. Offer as many specifics as you can and focus on positive
    outcomes of AWS projects when applicable.

    have that are in above-average demand. For example, one survey found that DevOps
    was the [top technical skill for aspiring](https://www.jeffersonfrank.com/insights/aws-skills-for-your-resume)
