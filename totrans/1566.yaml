    developments for the utilities providers that choose to investigate these things.
    Here are some examples of technology at work.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People increasingly feel excited about the potential for renewable energy. In
    addition to sustainability benefits, some individuals want to take advantage of
    federal or state tax credits for products such as solar power equipment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, a successful transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy means
    [analyzing crucial data points first](http://www.innoenergy.com/moving-the-world-to-renewable-energy-is-hard-how-ai-can-smooth-the-process/).
    Utility providers must assess the output of current or planned renewables projects
    and couple that anticipated total with the likely demand brought about by all
    the customers using renewables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beyond using big data platforms to examine those two variables and others, it's
    possible to depend on AI to take a predictive approach to the metrics. Such a
    system may determine that renewable energy sources get used the most during certain
    hours of the day or that there are particular areas of a community associated
    with exceptionally high usage.

- en: A [global poll of 26,000 respondents](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/11/20/16678350/global-support-clean-energy)
    found that the majority of them believe it's important to move toward a world
    powered completely by renewable energy. Another finding from the report highlighted
    how people want to do away with so much dependence on coal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clearly, consumer desire exists, but if utility companies don't peruse the data
    first, they could deal with unintended and preventable consequences. Worse still,
    if these problems make enterprises conclude that renewable projects failed, they
    won't be encouraged to invest in future opportunities to use renewables.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Power outages are prohibitively disruptive for customers and costly for utility
    companies to fix, but projects are underway to use AI — and specifically machine
    learning — to predict the conditions that cause power outages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A 2017 project at a Department of Energy laboratory [sought to identify weak
    points](https://phys.org/news/2017-09-ai-minimize-electric-grid-failures.html)
    in the electric grid and proactively repair them before outages occurred. Ten
    utility partners participated in the multi-year effort, and the goal was to create
    an autonomous system that handles ordinary fluctuations in power, plus responds
    to major events like storms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, a research team at Texas A&M University applied big data to improve
    tree maintenance and prevent overgrown branches from triggering lapses in electricity
    service. The traditional approach utility companies take is to schedule regular
    and rotating tree-trimming outings, but that method is both time- and cost-intensive.
  prefs: []

- en: The new data-driven option tells utility companies which trees are [most likely
    to cause issues](https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2017/07/researchers-develop-model-to-predict-and-prevent-power-outages-using-big-data.html).
    Then, those entities can prioritize certain areas over others. The created model
    also accepts information from several sources. For example, a utility brand can
    populate the system with operational data or known statistics about vegetation
    and growth patterns.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consumers have access to a wide variety of high-tech thermostats that help them
    cut utility costs. Statistics show that [23 percent of households](https://www.shipleyenergy.com/energy-101-guides/guide/2016/02/19/smart-thermostat-comparison)
    using the Ecobee3 smart thermostat save nearly a quarter of their energy bills
    with that model. Moreover, options exist that allow people to control their thermostats
    by sending text messages via their phones or set them to power-saving modes when
    the house is empty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, provided that utility companies get customers' permission, they could
    access the data from those thermostats and use it to learn more about needs and
    usage patterns. Having access to the data could facilitate making meaningful tweaks
    to marketing messages, including mentioning how a new offering caters to identified
    characteristics associated with a customer.

- en: Exelon, one of the largest utility companies in the United States, is appealing
    to customer needs with a chatbot. The company [built a prototype in under two
    weeks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2017/09/20/how-a-huge-utility-is-innovating-with-chatbots-for-better-customer-connections/#c20cce554152),
    and the bot answers questions about power outages and billing concerns. Theoretically,
    a company could also apply big data to a chatbot's interaction history to make
    business decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if a higher-than-average percentage of customers had queries about
    their bills after those documents got redesigned, a company might revert to the
    old design or make changes that clear up the confusion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or, if an exceptional number of customers in a subdivision or apartment complex
    asked the chatbot when they'd get power restored after an outage caused by a storm,
    the company might decide to send its teams there first before other places get
    tackled.

- en: If utility companies can't find effective ways to deal with waste, they'll likely
    have difficulties operating profitably. Data analytics platforms can illuminate
    areas of inefficiency, allowing providers to take prompt action and keep their
    costs down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, those providers could offer branded apps that empower customers to
    cut down on waste by tracking how much water and electricity they use.
  prefs: []

- en: However, it's not easy to spot problems if they relate to hidden leaks. An initiative
    from the University of Waterloo applies AI to find them in water pipes by using
    sound-processing capabilities to monitor for sounds that could indicate dribbles
    of water. This system is especially helpful because it can even locate slow [leaks
    equivalent to 17 liters](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181128082646.htm)
    — less than 4.5 gallons — per minute in lab tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Currently, the crews that deal with leaks get dispatched once substantial flooding
    becomes apparent, or they check pipes that could fail soon due to old age. But
    the University of Waterloo's AI-based method could lead to more proactive efforts
    that curb waste.
