    term encompasses so many fields, research topics and business use cases, that
    it can be difficult to even know where to start. To combat this, it’s often a
    good idea to turn to textbooks that will introduce you to the basic principles
    of your new field of research. This holds true for AI and machine learning, especially
    if you have a background in statistics or programming. When used alongside more
    focused online articles like our [introduction to training data](https://lionbridge.ai/articles/what-is-ai-training-data/),
    they can be an essential part of a powerful toolkit with which to learn and grow.

    to offer. Frequently used in university courses and recommended by professors
    and engineers alike, the following textbooks provide a tried and tested introduction
    to the wider world of AI. Even if you’ve got bags of experience with machine learning,
    picking up one of these textbooks could be a great refresher. After all, there’s
    always something new to learn.

    range of topics within its conceptual framework. It can be used either as an introduction
    to or reference book for topics including neural networks, random forests, and
    testing methods. However, the book has also been written in a style that encourages
    the reader to investigate things for themselves. In this way, it forms not just
    an introduction, but also encourages the development of skills that are useful
    for a later career in machine learning. The most recent version was released in
    2013.

    learning bestseller. As the title suggests, it’s one of the most succinct introductions
    to the field that’s currently in print. However, Burkov doesn’t avoid the necessary
    math, cramming both theory and practice into a mind-bogglingly small paperback.
    With its wide breadth of topic coverage and endorsements from machine learning
    thought leaders, this short title should be on the bookshelves of all newcomers
    to machine learning.

    for an introduction to predictive models and the modeling process. It covers the
    predictive modeling process from the beginning, starting with data preprocessing
    and moving through to regression and classification techniques. It focuses on
    solving real problems throughout, using hands-on examples and providing corresponding
    code in R for each stage. It also contains sets of problems in each chapter that
    are designed to help the reader apply what they’ve learned.
