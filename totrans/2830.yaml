    a new toolkit that simplifies the creation of deep learning models with just a
    few lines of code. The release marks Amazon's entrance in the ultra-competitive
    Automated machine learning(AutoML) space which is becoming one of the hottest
    trends for enterprise machine learning platforms. With some many news around the
    AutoML ecosystem, sometimes it becomes hard to differentiate signal from noise.
    Today, I would like to explore some of the most innovative AutoML stacks in the
    market that don't receive that much publicity.

    Often, people see AutoML as a mechanism to use out-of-the-box machine learning
    models without the need of sophisticated data science knowledge. While theoretically,
    this argument makes sense the reality if a bit different. In the current stage
    of artificial intelligence(AI), most real world applications require some level
    of machine learning knowledge. The scenarios that you can solve with a vanilla
    API like the Watson Developer Cloud or Microsoft Cognitive Services are very basic
    and represent only a small percentage of the broader spectrum of machine learning
    scenarios. If that's the case, then we should wonder what's the real value of
    AutoML.

- en: Model selection is one of the most difficult aspects of building a machine learning
    solutions. Somewhat ironically, for all the science and match baked into machine
    learning applications, model selection remains a highly subjective tasks that
    relies on the opinions of experts. For any given scenario, the number of machine
    learning models that can solve it is incredibly large so how can we really know
    if we are using the most optimal model for the job? Even worse, even if we have
    selected the right machine learning technique, how can we be sure we have the
    right neural network architecture in place? And once we settled on a specific
    architecture, how can we know the correct hyperparameter configurations? Those
    questions hunt data scientists throughout the entire lifecycle of a machine learning
    application. Furthermore, the more accuracy is needed for a machine learning problem
    the more time is spent in the model selection process.

    model is an extremely time-consuming exercise that never delivers an exact answer.
    Paradoxically, this is the type of problem in which machine learning excels so
    can we get creative and model the process of selecting a machine learning architecture
    as machine learning problem in and out itself?

    Given a dataset, a series of optimization metrics and some constraints in terms
    of time or resources, AutoML methods should be able to evaluate tens of thousands
    of neural network architectures and produce an optimal result. While effective
    data science teams might be able to evaluate a dozen models for a given problem,
    an AutoML method can quickly search through tens of thousands of architectures
    in a relatively manageable time.
