- en: Because this request might take a long time, we don't want to run it when it's
    unnecessary, so it's good practice to save the results and load them when we continue
    working. To do so we will use Pickle. Pickle can serialize any variable, save
    it to file, and then load it. Here is an example of how it works.

    If you are into social media you know this is a peak usage time, and when most
    companies chose to post to get the most engagements.

- en: Now you can simply use the functions as follows. Note that if the number of
    followers are large you will need to do more than one request (more on that next).
    Here we made one request to get the followers / following. The JSON result contains
    a list of 'users' that contains all info about each follower / following.

    was enough to get all following in my case.

    I will convert them into a more friendly data type -- a set -- in order to perform
    some set operations on them.

    too -- and is more user friendly -- but it is not unique, and some users may not
    have a value for full_name.

    point, such as saving the followers list and then comparing it at a later time
    to get the list of unfollowers.

    how you can use the Instagram API and got a basic idea of what you can do with
    it. Keep an eye on the original as it is still under development, and there will
    be more things you can do in the future. For any questions or suggestions do not
    hesitate to contact me.
