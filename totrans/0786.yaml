    In the other machine model, the data processing to find the meaningful features
    is often done manually or relying on domain expertise; however, deep learning

- en: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a deep learning algorithm
    specifically designed for tasks where object recognition is crucial - like image
    classification, detection, and segmentation. CNNs are able to achieve state-of-the-art
    accuracy on complex vision tasks, powering many real-life applications such as
    surveillance systems, warehouse management, and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As humans, we can easily recognize objects in images by analyzing patterns,
    shapes, and colors. CNNs can be trained to perform this recognition too, by learning
    which patterns are important for differentiation. For example, when trying to
    distinguish between a photo of a Cat versus a Dog, our brain focuses on unique
    shape, textures, and facial features. A CNN learns to pick up on these same types
    of distinguishing characteristics. Even for very fine-grained categorization tasks,
    CNNs are able to learn complex feature representations directly from pixels.

    Language Processing has been an interesting topic, a topic that is currently taking

    but wouldn’t it be good to understand where it all comes from? So let’s go back
    to the basics - NLP.
  prefs: []

- en: NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence, and it is the ability of a computer
    to detect and understand human language, through speech and text just the way
    we humans can. NLP helps models process, understand and output the human language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of NLP is to bridge the communication gap between humans and computers.
    NLP models are typically trained on tasks such as next word prediction which allow
    them to build contextual dependencies and then be able to generate relevant outputs.
