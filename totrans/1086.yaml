    of its privacy, along with educating society on how to manage their personal information.
    Governments, Parliaments, National Data Protection bodies, and more carry out
    workshops, provide information and guide people about the rights to personal data
    protection and privacy. It also encourages existing businesses to respect data

    off from the Council of Europe which decided on the 26th of April 2006 to launch
    a Data Protection Day to be celebrated on the 28th January. Data Protection Day
    commemorates the first legally binding international treaty dealing with privacy
    and data protection on January 28th, 1981, the signing of Convention 108.

    enforcing these same rules and regulations 22 years later. Convention 108 was
    used to build the pillars for the first European Union directive on data protection
    adopted in 1995, to which succeeded in 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR). GDPR is one of the most solid privacy and security laws in the world.
    Although it was constructed and passed by the European Union (EU), it establishes
    and enforces obligations onto organisations anywhere, as long as they target or
    collect data related to people in the EU.

    of technology; there needs to be specific rules and regulations set in stone.
    Gaining people's trust is difficult, therefore more needs to be done in protecting
    data containing people's personal information. Giving individuals control over
    the data collected and making them aware of how the data is being used is the
    biggest step in gaining their trust.

    organisation is taking to prevent any data challenges or abuse by unauthorised
    third-party access. This includes access control, encryption, and security all
    enforced to prevent the exploitation of data.

    to collect the data on a lawful basis, regardless of the measures of security
    taken to protect the data, it is a violation of Data Privacy. This tells us that
    Data Security can exist without Data Privacy.

    employees to take the correct measures to keep themselves safe at home, they will
    practice these same security and privacy measures at work. Frequently asking the
    whole company to change their password after a set period of time and providing
    them with YubiKeys are examples of how to build a culture of privacy and security
    in the organisation.
