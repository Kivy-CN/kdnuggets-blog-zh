    continues to play an increasingly prominent role in modern business, the profession
    will only become more valuable. Considering this promising outlook, it’s an ideal
    time to pursue a career as a data scientist.

    of Labor Statistics expects these jobs to [grow 15% by 2029](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm#tab-1),
    which is much faster than the national average. Data scientists made a median
    salary of $122,840 in 2019.

    but how to do so may be less evident. Here’s a step-by-step guide to starting
    your career in data science.

- en: As with most professions, you’ll need an appropriate education before you can
    work as a data scientist. Ideally, you should get an undergraduate degree in a
    related field, such as computer science, information systems, or data analytics.
    Most professional data scientists also have a master’s degree, typically in a
    more specialized area within data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you already have a degree, you don’t necessarily need to go back to school
    for a more relevant one. You should, however, look into online programs where
    you can take a few data science courses. Seeking out some extra certifications
    and licenses will also prove helpful.
  prefs: []

- en: The skills you learn in your classes aren’t the only education you’ll need to
    become a data scientist. You should also look into learning various programming
    languages and seek hands-on experience. You can find plenty of books and online
    courses that will help you develop these skills.

- en: You’ll need more than an education to get a job as a data scientist. Most companies
    will also look for tangible evidence of your skills. Mohammad Shokoohi-Yekta,
    a former senior data scientist at Apple, says you [should be comfortable with
    code](https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-be-a-data-scientist-five-ways-to-get-that-job-in-data-science/)
    and applying data science over being theoretical.

- en: The best way you can show your comfort and knowledge in this area is through
    a portfolio of your work. As early as you can, start getting involved in hands-on
    data science projects and compiling them into a portfolio. You can do this through
    freelance data work and pet projects in areas that interest you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your portfolio should feature a variety of different data science projects to
    showcase your versatility. You should demonstrate skills in various programming
    languages, industries, and project types. If you can get into any data science-related
    competitions, your work in those will be an excellent portfolio addition.

    looking for a position.

    a niche industry with specific qualifications and certifications. For example,
    all Department of Defense contractors [need to meet CMMC compliance](https://www.neosystemscorp.com/solutions-services/hosting-security/cmmc/),
    so you could earn this certification and better your chances of getting a job
    with the DoD.

    Emphasize your skills and experience that are most relevant to the specific industry
    and position at hand. In addition to applying to jobs through sites like Indeed,
    grow your network on LinkedIn and try to build a respectable online presence where
    employers will notice you.

    In fact, it may be best to apply to a related but more entry-level position like
    data analysis first. You can grow your career from there.

    of that, try not to be too selective about the first position you accept. If you
    get an offer for a steady job in a data-related field, but it isn’t your ideal
    position, you may still want to take it. Think of your first data job as a launching
    point.

    job](https://tomimester.medium.com/how-to-break-into-the-data-science-market-f0e0b79b42f7)
    in data science. At these medium-sized businesses, you’ll be able to learn from
    senior data scientists and have plenty of opportunities to advance. Once you start
    working in your first position, take the initiative by trying to work on as many
    projects as you can without stretching yourself thin.

    experience you’ll gain. As you work, look for chances to move upward both within
    your current business and other companies. If you show initiative and a remarkable
    work ethic, you’ll advance as a data scientist before long.
