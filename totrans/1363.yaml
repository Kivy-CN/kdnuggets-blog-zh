    follow a **systematic process**. To be able to have that, we need a plan and a
    methodology to do a data science project. Sadly, most data science projects fail
    because the people involved don’t understand clearly what they have to do, or
    what are the most important things for a company. Your solution needs to be tied
    to the goals and objectives of the company or its departments.

    of a company and a project. With context, I mean all the specifics on how a company
    runs its projects, how the company is established, its competitors, how many departments
    exist, the different objectives and goals they have, and how they measure success
    or failure.

    also the expectations, what every person in it will do, and how the project fits
    within the department running it, also how many people are involved and what is
    expected from you.

    But the common thing they have is that they all use data. And you want to be able

    we have to do it consistently, it's not random, we have to plan for it, and also
    it depends on engineers, data architects, DataOps and more people than just the
    data scientist.

    the most important features for predicting your target, and also, where you can
    find new sources of information that can improve your understanding of the data
    and your models.

    it's what's called open data. Now, the idea with open data is this. It's data
    that is free, it's easily accessible, and it's downloadable in convenient forms
    like, for instance, a CSV or comma-separated values, which is a common form of
    spreadsheet data.

    of data analysis and preparation is where you can check if the previous steps
    were done correctly, or maybe you need to think about the business case again,
    or maybe you need more data or different data.

    and also algebra to get the most out of your data. There are great tools to analyze
    data for free like SQL, Python, or R, or you can do it even with tools like Excel,
    or if you have the possibilities, you can use platforms like Tableau, PowerBI,
    and Explorium.

    code, or being able to read data from different databases. It is about solving
    problems. An analogy would be saying that physics isn’t about calculus, moving
    objects, algebra; it’s about studying nature, understanding it, and modeling it.

    rethinking the business process and needs, experimenting a lot, listening what
    the data have to say, understanding and encouraging the business to understand
    that the data’s opinion must always be included in product discussions, finding
    a critical path to solve the problem and then organizing the team around completing
    it and going further, letting the models solve the problems, of course using our
    expertise to help them, but not biasing them.

    If you have a poor understanding of the business context, even if you are an expert
    in machine learning, you will not be able to solve the problem. If you don’t collect
    the data following a systematic process that enables you to get the best sources
    of information and use the data you already have, it’s impossible to achieve your
    goals, and finally, if you don’t take the time to analyze and prepare the data,
    you will not be able to validate the last steps and come up with hypotheses for
    the drivers of the identified problems.
