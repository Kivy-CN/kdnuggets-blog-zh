- en: Data is the lifeblood of research in machine learning. However, access to truly
    large-scale datasets is a privilege that has been traditionally reserved for machine
    learning researchers and data scientists working at large companies – and out
    of reach for most academic researchers.

- en: Research scientists at Yahoo Labs have long enjoyed working on large-scale machine
    learning problems inspired by consumer-facing products. This has enabled us to
    advance the thinking in areas such as search ranking, computational advertising,
    information retrieval, and core machine learning. A key aspect of interest to
    the external research community has been the application of new algorithms and
    methodologies to production traffic and to large-scale datasets gathered from
    real products.

- en: Today, we are proud to announce the public release of the largest-ever machine
    learning dataset to the research community. The dataset stands at a massive ~110B
    events (13.5TB uncompressed) of anonymized user-news item interaction data, collected
    by recording the user-news item interactions of about 20M users from February
    2015 to May 2015\.

    is a collection based on a sample of anonymized user interactions on the news
    feeds of several Yahoo properties, including the Yahoo homepage, Yahoo News, Yahoo
    Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Movies, and Yahoo Real Estate.

- en: Our goals are to promote independent research in the fields of large-scale machine
    learning and recommender systems, and to help level the playing field between
    industrial and academic research. The dataset is available as part of the Yahoo
    Labs [Webscope](http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/) data-sharing program, which
    is a reference library of scientifically-useful datasets comprising anonymized
    user data for non-commercial use.

    information (age range, gender, and generalized geographic data) for a subset
    of the anonymized users. On the item side, we are releasing the title, summary,
    and key-phrases of the pertinent news article. The interaction data is timestamped
    with the relevant local time and also contains partial information about the device
    on which the user accessed the news feeds, which allows for interesting work in
    contextual recommendation and temporal data mining.

    on a full-scale version of the Yahoo News Feed dataset, which has sparked some
    compelling ideas (e.g. [Birds, Apps, and Users: Scalable Factorization Machines](https://yahoolabs.tumblr.com/post/133013312756/birds-apps-and-users-scalable-factorization)
    and [Science Powering Product and Personalization: Going Beyond Clicks](https://yahoolabs.tumblr.com/post/99405569711/science-powering-product-and-personalization))
    in the areas of behavior modeling, recommender systems, large-scale and distributed
    machine learning, ranking, online algorithms, content modeling, and time-series
    mining.'

    data scientists, and machine learning enthusiasts in academia, and help validate
    their models on an extensive, “real-world” dataset. We strongly believe that this
    dataset can become the benchmark for large-scale machine learning and recommender
    systems, and we look forward to hearing from the community about their applications
    of our data.
