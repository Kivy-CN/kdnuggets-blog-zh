    intensive machine learning tasks. Now, thanks to RAPIDS cuDF, GPUs can also turbocharge
    your data analysis work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[RAPIDS cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) is an open-source, GPU-accelerated
    dataframe library that implements the familiar pandas API for processing and analyzing
    your data. The Python cuDF interface is built on libcudf, the CUDA/C++ computational
    core that accelerates fundamental data operations from ingestion and parsing,
    to joins, aggregations, and more. For some workloads, you will find that switching
    from `import pandas` to `import cudf` accelerates your workloads and can lead
    to data processing speedups of 10x or more.'

    runtime update to Python 3.8](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rapidsai-community/showcase/blob/main/getting_started_tutorials/cudf_pandas_colab_demo.ipynb?ncid=ref-inor-594904) and
    the new [RAPIDS pip packages](https://rapids.ai/pip.html), you can try out NVIDIA
    GPU-accelerated data science right in your browser. Running RAPIDS on Colab requires
    just two quick steps:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, select a Colab runtime that uses a GPU accelerator. Navigate to the “Runtime”
    menu and select “Change runtime type,” then choose “GPU” from the dropdown and
    click “Save.” The NVIDIA GPU that you receive from Colab may vary across sessions,
    — including both newer GPUs and older generations. With the new “Pay As You Go”
    Tier in Colab, you now have the option to upgrade your runtime to “Premium GPUs”
    with Colab Pro, enabling access to more powerful [NVIDIA A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) or
    V100 Tensor Core GPUs. [See Google’s blog post for more information on GPU availability.](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/09/colabs-pay-as-you-go-offers-more-access-to-powerful-nvidia-compute-for-machine-learning.html#:~:text=Paid%20Colab%20users%20can%20now,or%20A100%20Tensor%20Core%20GPUs.)

    installation completes:'

    notebook, “[10 minutes to cuDF.](https://nvda.ws/3PijZIA)” This notebook is inspired
    by a similar guide from the Pandas community and is a streamlined version of our
    full notebook, “[10 Minutes to cuDF and Dask-cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/user_guide/10min.html).”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Running through the notebook, you will find examples of dataframe creation,
    data filtering, transformation, joins, aggregations and more. We’ve also included
    file reading and writing examples for Parquet, ORC and CSV formats. As you investigate
    more complex data processing, we hope that you use this as a companion to [cuDF’s
    documentation](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/).

    large workflows, [cuML](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/) for scikit-learn-compatible,
    accelerated machine learning, and [cuGraph](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cugraph/stable/) for
    graph data analytics. Update your Colab notebook with the extended installation
    list, as shown in the following code block, and you’ll be ready to use the complete
    toolkit.
