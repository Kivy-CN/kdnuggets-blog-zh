- en: If you have just come from University or decided to return to the job market,
    platforms such as LinkedIn should be your best friend. LinkedIn is the world's
    largest professional network out there, and it will help you find new jobs, connect
    with like-minded people and discover new opportunities.

- en: I have spoken to a lot of fresh graduate students in the past and they have
    always been reluctant to open up a LinkedIn profile and I have always been confused
    why. But who isn’t nervous about something they don’t know?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understand that LinkedIn is your personal brand. When you create a LinkedIn
    profile, you want it to truly resonate with who you are, your professional background,
    and the services you can provide.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this blog, I will go through how to set up your LinkedIn profile, and what
    you need to increase your callback rate for potential jobs and opportunities.
    So let’s get started…
  prefs: []

- en: If you don’t have a LinkedIn profile already, you will need to sign up for LinkedIn.
    Once you have done this, you will have a blank LinkedIn profile, which you can
    customize.

    thing other LinkedIn members will see. Remember, LinkedIn is a professional network,
    therefore your profile picture should resonate exactly that.

    pixels. Once you have your image ready, it’s time for you to upload it as your
    LinkedIn profile picture.

    can allow you to present who you are through this. For example, if you have a
    company and you have a motto, you can upload your motto to your banner. Another
    example is software engineers being creative by illustrating a breakdown of their
    profile through coding, as shown below.

    step is adding some content. Here we will start with the ‘Intro’ section, which
    you can access by clicking on the pencil icon in the top right-hand corner of
    your profile, adjacent to your profile picture.

    section and fill out a more extensive overview.
  prefs:

    and junior school.

    users make. For example, you may have been living and studying in New York all
    your life, but you want to make a transition to starting a new life and career
    in San Francisco.
  prefs: []

    United States, with a specific postal code to San Francisco. This way your profile
    will be more visible to hiring managers in those specific areas.

    set, as well as mention a career change. This is where people learn more about

    will see a ‘Skills’ section, click on that. In this part, you need to add some
    relevant skills to your expertise. If you are job hunting, the best thing to do
    is add skills that are typically found in job descriptions of the title you want.

    description into [WordCloud](https://monkeylearn.com/word-cloud/), and it will

    skills to add to your list.
