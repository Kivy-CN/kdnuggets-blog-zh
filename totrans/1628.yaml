    was a particularly noteworthy example of the public work. During my PhD I was
    an active answerer on the programming site Stack Overflow, and an engineer at
    the company came across one of my answers (one explaining the intuition behind
    the beta distribution). He was so impressed with the answer that he got in touch

    discussions are ways to show some competency as a data scientist. It is important
    to emphasize that Kaggle is not like an industry project as [Colleen Farrelly](https://www.quora.com/profile/Colleen-Farrelly-1),

    Kaggle competitions take care of coming up with a task, acquire data for you,
    and clean it into some usable form. What it does is give you practice analyzing
    data and coming up with a model. [Reshama Shaikh](https://twitter.com/reshamas) has

    who worked at the company…once I was interested in a company, I would use LinkedIn
    to find a first- or second- degree connection at the company. I would write to
    that connection, asking to talk to them about their experience at the company
    and, if possible, whether they’d be able to connect me to someone on the Data
    Science team. Whenever I could, I did in-person meetings (coffee or lunch) instead
    of phone calls. As an aside, Trey Causey recently wrote [a great post](https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d)on
    how to ask for just these kinds of meetings. I would never ask for a job directly,
    but they would usually ask for my resume and offer to submit me as an internal
    referral, or put me in touch with a hiring manager. If they didn’t seem comfortable
    doing so...I’d just thank them for their time and move on.

    a job. Jason even mentions the importance of a portfolio in that and [other articles
