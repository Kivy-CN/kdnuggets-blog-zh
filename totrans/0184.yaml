    statistical terminology to come up with a conclusion or even ask a question. After
    the interpretation of the results, you need to come up with a plan that is suitable
    for your company. GPT-4 is not good at coming up with the right answer when there
    are multiple moving parts. It is where our knowledge of statistical analysis will
    come in handy.

    project. You have to write too many follow-up prompts just to get the right action
    plan. And even then, you need to double-check the project plan before you present
    it to your manager. All of the follow-up promptings require an understanding of
    data core concepts like data ingestion, data cleaning, data manipulation, data
    visualizations, data analysis, and data modeling.
