    class of tasks *T* and performance measure *P*, if its performance at tasks in
    *T*, as measured by *P*, improves with experience *E*.

- en: Tom Mitchell's quote is well-known and time-tested in the world of machine learning,
    having first appeared in his 1997 book. The sentence has been influential on me,
    personally, as I have referred to it numerous times over the years and referenced
    it in my Master's thesis. The quote also features prominently in Chapter 5 of
    the much more recent and authoritative "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio &
    Courville, serving as the jumping off point for the book's explanation of learning
    algorithms.

    machine learning algorithms and their learning processes in order to help solidify
    one's understanding of learning algorithms abstractly and even more concretely.
    Let's have a look at how we can get quite a bit of mileage out of such a succinct
    few words.

- en: First off, let's keep in mind that our focus here is on the machine learning
    algorithms, and **the process of learning**. This means we must differentiate
    between our **task** and the learning process, and understand how they relate.

- en: If, for instance, we want to classify images, it is important to distinguish
    between performing our task (image classification) and learning how to perform
    our task, which can be described as "our means of attaining the ability to perform
    the task"². A single image would be the example which our machine learning system
    would process, relating back to the above quote.

    and density estimation.

- en: During the learning process, we must determine if our example has led us further
    toward our ultimate task goal; we need to **measure its performance**. In our
    example, in other words, has what we have learned from the previous processed
    example(s) allowed us to better classify images?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Fortunately, what we want to know in this case can be quantified and easily
    measured: accuracy or, inversely, error rate, in the case of classification. Sometimes
    knowing what to measure is difficult; knowing what to measure but not being able
    to measure it is a potential problem as well.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to best measure performance, we are generally interested in assessing
    on data which has not previously been seen by our learning algorithm, which is
    where the concept of having training and testing datasets comes into play.

    **supervised** by what kind of experience they are allowed to have during the
    learning process.

- en: The concept of **experience** is a bit more abstract than the others, and is
    more difficult to point to something concrete (e.g. particular lines of code in
    an implemented model) which embodies it.

- en: 'Broadly, experience relates to how a learning algorithm experiences data from
    which it learns. The easiest angle from which we can describe such experience
    is whether the data is labeled (supervised learning) or not (unsupervised learning).
    In this sense, experience is all about how the process of learning takes place,
    as in: is this a form of self-learning, or is it a guided process?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also more fully describe the dataset being learned from as part of the
    experience. Generally, data is packed into matrices, which are collections of
    examples. Examples, in turn, are collections of features, which describe a particular
    example. This feature set may or may not be supplemented with a label (or target),
    dependent on whether it will be used for supervised or unsupervised learning.
