    which is your nature of curiosity, determination and tenacity. There are so many
    times when you hit a problem: perhaps the algorithm isn’t performing in the way
    it needs to, or perhaps the technology is being a pain. Either way, you can study
    machine learning algorithms or software engineering best practice, but if you’re

    you are starting from affects what type of data science you are most suited to,
    and what you need to learn for the area that interests you. So to answer this
    question sufficiently, it is necessary to explore the typical paths to data science,
    beginning with the wider scientific field.

    The differences tend to arise in the tools and techniques; for example, while

    to learn tools and techniques in a short timeframe.'

    a Data Scientist. Most Data Scientists come from backgrounds in statistics or
    computer science. However, while these other career paths develop some of the
    skills listed above, they typically don’t cover all of them. Statisticians are
    very strong on the maths and stats side, but generally have weaker programming
    skills. Computer scientists are very strong in the programming arena, but typically
    don’t have as strong a comprehension of statistics. Both have good (yet different)
    data analysis skill sets but can struggle with creative problem solving, which
    is arguably the hardest skill to teach”*'

    all data scientists from statistics or computer science lack creative problem
    solving; the argument he is making is that science filters extremely effectively
    for problem solving, arguably more so than statistics/computer science.

    in Chapter One, statistical modelling and machine learning are related, and they
    overlap in many ways. However the latter possesses significant advantages when

    to rise in all areas of industry, it really is synonymous with all types of data
