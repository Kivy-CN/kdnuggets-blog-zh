    ML teams across various industries are developing their own techniques for processing
    data, training models, and using them in production. This is clearly not a sustainable
    approach to Machine Learning. Over time, these diverse approaches will become
    standardized. To accelerate that process, the industry needs developer tools designed
    specifically for AI. In this article, you’ll see the difference between traditional
    data storage solutions and databases that are built to address AI use cases.

- en: The Oracle database was introduced more than 40 years ago as a target for this
    kind of data entry. Even though many enterprises were using it as a default database,
    it was a quite complicated product for a regular user. It was also proprietary
    and thus not accessible to developers. Oracle even initiated the DeWitt Clause,
    which prohibits the publication of database benchmarks that haven’t been authorized
    by the creators of the database in question.

- en: Fast forward 15 years, and we saw a new generation of databases like MySQL and
    PostgreSQL. The key differentiator from Oracle's offer was accessibility – the
    new breed of databases were open-source products and could be run on a local machine,
    which made it much easier for developers to set up and use. It’s not that surprising
    that they gained wide adoption during the dot.com boom.

- en: Moving forward in the timeline, we’ve seen the rise of “Web 2.0” in the early
    2000s. Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat of Google proposed MapReduce, a radically
    new approach to data processing. The logic behind this method was alternatively
    performing mapping and reduction operations on datasets. Mapping operations include
    filtering and sorting of data in rows and columns. Reduction operations involve
    summaries and aggregations of tabular data. The infrastructure was designed to
    run in parallel. This MapReduce approach sits at the core of Hadoop, one of the
    most successful open source projects of the 2000s.

    To name the most popular ones – Apache Cassandra, Google’s BigTable, MongoDB,
    Redis, and Amazon’s DynamoDB.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key differentiator for these databases is that they scale well horizontally.
    Many machines could spin up in parallel and collaboratively serve a database capable
    of housing truly large large datasets. NoSQL databases don’t use a relational
    approach to model their data as rows and columns, and readily accept unstructured
    data without requiring complex data models.

- en: 'It’s also important to mention that there are two types of databases: transactional
    and analytical. Transactional databases are operational and store critical data,
    like user logs, activity, IP addresses, purchase orders, etc. They are designed
    to be readily available, accept new data quickly, and serve requests for data
    with minimal delay. Analytical databases work much more slowly, can be hosted
    on cheaper storage, and allow for more in-depth analysis of data than would be
    feasible to perform in a transactional database.'

    as applications became more complex. At that time proper analytics involved pulling
    larger amounts of data from different places. New products entered the market
    to address the rising challenge -- Amazon RedShift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery,
    Clickhouse. These data warehouses have become mainstays for modern enterprises.

    Lakehouses help their users query historical data at a low cost but experience
    little to no degradation in analytical and ML workloads. This turned into something
    of an arms race [between Snowflake and Databricks](https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/11/15/snowflake-rebuts-databricks-snowflake-performance-comparison/).
    While they carry on their battle in the world of tabular data, something big is
    rising from the deep.

    data. Unlike tabular data, which is represented in rows and columns, unstructured
    data consists of images, video-streams, audio, and text. This is data that cannot
    be represented in a spreadsheet.

    social media has skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. These products all deal
    with and generate large quantities of unstructured data. How should the companies
    manage that data, especially if they want to use it to drive deep insights through
    AI? Can AI teams working with this data use database solutions for their work?

    is extremely expensive for ML datasets as they are very big. Even using attached
    disks like AWS EBS is very costly. The most cost-efficient storage layer is object
    storage such as S3, Google Cloud Storage, and MinIO, but these tools are slow
    for rapid querying or computation.

    This functionality will allow much faster computation and is more cost-effective,
    because accessing data from this type of framework should not incur any additional
    pre-processing costs for ML models. Such a framework would help modern, AI-enabled
    enterprises [save up to 30% on their infrastructure costs.](https://activeloop-forbes.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/forbes_article_-_better_aerial_data_pipelines.pdf)

    a few lines of code. [According to a recent survey from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2021),
    over 20% of data scientists have less than 3 years of industry experience, and
    another 14% have less than a year. Machine learning is still a young field and
