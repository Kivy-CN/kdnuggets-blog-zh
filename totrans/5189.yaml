- en: In the last three years I’ve transitioned from being a software engineer to
    a data engineer. I fell into the area of data management when Maarten Masschelein,
    my fellow co-founder at Soda, and I started working together to solve the problem
    of data issues that are silent and undetected. Coming from a software engineering
    background, writing unit tests and monitoring applications in production is a
    given but in data, it’s quite different. Whilst most organizations are aware they
    should test, there is no strategy in place and they just don’t know how to start
    addressing the problem which leaves their systems exposed and can result in serious
    downstream issues for the data products they are building.

    been more important to test and monitor the quality of data being used. And so
    we set about building a data observability platform that enables organizations
    to discover, prioritize and resolve data issues.

- en: We started with Soda SQL, made available in February 2021\. It’s our first open
    source data testing, monitoring and profiling tool for data-intensive environments.
    It works with your existing data engineering workflows to create a quick and easy
    way to define what good quality data means to your business. This enables data
    engineers to define tests and protect against the silent data issues that go undetected
    in datasets, data lakes, and data warehouses.

- en: Soda SQL is an open source tool with simple Command Line Interface (CLI) and
    Python library to test your data through metric collection. It utilizes YAML config
    files as input to prepare SQL queries that run tests on tables in a database to
    compute a wide range of metrics and tests. It's super easy to find invalid, missing,
    or unexpected data. Because Soda SQL leverages --you guessed it-- SQL, the data
    can stay where it is and existing compute engines can be leveraged.

- en: If tests fail, Soda SQL allows you to stop the pipeline and prevent bad data
    from causing damage. As metrics are computed, diagnostic information is captured
    as well to help with the analysis if a data issue is detected. Steps can then
    be taken to prioritize and collaboratively resolve issues as one data team. Soda
    SQL can be used manually on its own or integrated with a data orchestration tool
    to schedule scans and automate actions based on scan results.

- en: We have just released Soda Cloud, which is a web application where the Soda
    SQL metrics and test results can be monitored over time. Soda Cloud creates transparency
    from engineers to other people in the data team. With this collaboration data
    teams get ahead of the silent data issues. Soda Cloud extends Soda SQL and the
    two work together seamlessly.
  prefs: []

- en: First of all Soda Cloud extends Soda SQL with a metrics database so that measurements
    and test results can be visualized over time. This enables monitoring change over
    time and anomaly detection on all of the metrics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These visualizations and data profiles already create transparency between different
    people in the larger data team. All people in the data team get to see what data
    is actually present, what tests are performed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the Soda Cloud goes one step further. It enables non-technical people to
    build and maintain their own monitors in a simple UI with a 3-step wizard. This
    is important because it removes the bottleneck to monitoring the domain knowledge
    that Subject Matter Experts have. If they don't need to involve data engineers
    to get their domain logic tested, that means a lot more of that domain knowledge
    will be used to define what good data looks like. And as a result, a lot more
    bad data will be captured preventing various kinds of damages.

- en: Soda Cloud prescriptively solves the problem of discovering the silent data
    issues, by giving data teams a central platform to track and score the health
    of data across core quality dimensions.

- en: Data and analytics engineers are equipped with a way to test data each and every
    time it transforms to ensure data pipelines are reliable. Via Soda SQL, data production
    can be stopped and quarantined. Soda Cloud visualizes the health of data sets
    and acts as a communication hub for data issues.

    built integrations with email and Slack to ensure the right people are alerted,
    at the right time to diagnose, prioritize and resolve the data issues.
