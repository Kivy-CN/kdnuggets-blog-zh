    into Data Science, I've answered it enough that I decided to write it out here
    so I can link people to it. So if you’re one of those students, welcome!

    just google 'how to get into data science' and advice that is less common, but
    advice that I've found very useful over the years. I'll start with the latter,
    and move on to basic advice. Obviously take this with a grain of salt as all advice
    comes with a bit of survivorship bias.

    and motivated people like yourself to learn and grow with. For my alma mater,
    that community was the [Data Science and Informatics club](http://www.dsiufl.org/).
    Communities/networks help you get started, keep you motivated, and are key for
    scoring internships and full time offers in the long term.

    field or area you care about helps you stay motivated and stand out. A couple
    of my examples of this are: using [UF''s (alma mater) student government elections](https://towardsdatascience.com/two-decades-of-uf-student-government-elections-using-machine-learning-for-deeper-insights-c137c0586466) to
    learn about machine learning approaches, or tracking my friends'' Elo scores by [recording
    our games of ping pong](http://www.tylerjrichards.com/Ping_pong.html). These projects
    taught me essential skills without explicitly feeling like work.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Recruiters will spend 15 seconds on your resume, potential teams will spend
    1-5 minutes (at most) on your resume + website/Github (on average, visitors to [my
    portfolio site](http://tylerjrichards.com/) spend 2 minutes and 16 seconds before
    moving on). Both groups often use proxies for competence like GPA, school quality,
    or experience in data from a tech firm (I call these: proof of status). As a result,
    you should very closely think about the time needed to signal to the reader that
    you can do whatever job they’re looking to hire for. A rough metric to consider
    for this is Clicks to Proof of Competence.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the recruiter has to click on the right repository in your Github and then
    click through files until they find the Jupyter notebook with unreadable code
    (without comments nonetheless), you’ve already lost. If the recruiter sees Machine
    Learning on your resume, but it takes 5 clicks to see any ML product or code that
    you've made, you've already lost. Anyone can lie on a resume; make a point to
    direct the reader’s attention quickly, and you’ll be in a significantly better
    spot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way i've thought about optimizing for this metric is pretty clear on [my
    website](http://tylerjrichards.com/). It roughly takes 10 seconds to skim the
    text (I would bet that most people don't read it all the way through), and then
    immediately people can choose a Data Science project to view, which are ordered
    by how well they show the work I can do. For starting off in DS, I would highly
    recommend making a website (even a bootstrap template website is fine) and hosting
    it on Github pages or heroku with your own domain.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you do those three things, see if you can convince someone to pay you
    to learn data science. There is a great election data science group at UF that
    I loved (Dr McDonald and Dr Smith run it currently), but if you go to any research
    group and interview with them they might pay you for your work. Eventually, with
    experience like that, then you can apply for internships and get paid super well.
    The key here is to not start out looking for the incredibly fancy DS internships,
    but locally at companies or research groups that have Data Science tasks but not
    enough money to hire a full time Data Scientist. Data Science learning compounds
    quickly, so start now! Given all of that, let’s move on to the more basic advice.

    of data science into some business context is hard and takes practice, and often
    involves a solid understanding of metrics, product analytics and incentive structures.
    This fits in very well with #2 from the less basic advice.'

    My final offer to you, in exchange for reading to the bottom of this long-ish
    piece, is to say that once you finish applying data science to a problem you’re
    passionate about and posting it somewhere online, DM it to me on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/tylerjrichards) and
    I promise to read it and retweet it. Good luck!
