    should ultimately depend on your interests and where your passion lies. However,
    if you’re sitting on the fence, unsure of which to choose because they are of
    equal interest, then keep reading!

    has arrived — data engineers. In this article, I’m going to share with you several
    reasons why you might want to consider pursuing data engineering over data science.

- en: We’ve all heard the saying “garbage in, garbage out”, but only now are companies
    starting to truly understand the meaning of this. Machine learning and deep learning
    can be powerful but only in very special circumstances. Aside from the fact that
    there needs to be a substantial amount of data and a practical use for ML and
    DL, companies need to satisfy the **data hierarchy of needs** from the bottom
    up.

- en: The same way that we have physical needs (i.e. food and water) before social
    needs (i.e. the need for relationships), companies need to satisfy several requirements
    which generally fall under the data engineering umbrella. Notice how data science,
    specifically machine learning and deep learning, are the very last things that
    matter.

    Hence, there is a growing demand for data engineers at the moment and there’s

    the number of data science interviews only grew by 10% from 2019 to 2020, while
    the **number of data engineering interviews grew by 40%** in the same period of
    time!

    data scientist roles**.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    scientists can focus on data science work and data engineers can focus on data
    engineering work.

    the majority of companies actually require their data scientists to know some
    amount of data engineering skills.'

    and I’ll give an example: If you’re a business analyst that doesn’t know SQL,
    you’ll have to ask a data analyst to query information every time you want to
    gather insights, which creates a bottleneck in your workflow. Similarly, if you’re
    a data scientist without the fundamental knowledge of a data engineer, there will
    certainly be times when you’ll have to rely on someone else to fix an ETL pipeline
    or clean data as opposed to doing it on your own.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my opinion, it’s much easier to learn data science as a data engineer than
    learn data engineering skills as a data scientist. Why? Well there’s simply more
    resources available for data science, and **there are a number of tools and libraries
    that have been built to make data science easier**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so, if you’re starting out your career, I personally think it’s more worthwhile
    investing your time learning data engineering than data science because you have
    more time to invest. When you’re working a full time job and a couple of years
    into your career, you might find that you don’t have the capacity or energy to
    invest as much time in learning. So from that perspective, I think it’s better
    to learn the harder realm first.

    data science, like data modeling and model deployment. Later, companies like PyCaret

    a number of opportunities to make data engineering easier.
