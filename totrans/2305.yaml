    one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules. They were first
    introduced by Andrey Markov in 1906 as a way to model the behavior of random processes,
    and have since been applied to a wide range of fields, including physics, biology,
    economics, statistics, machine learning, and computer science.

    credited with developing the theory of these systems in the early 20th century.
    Markov was interested in understanding the behavior of random processes, and he
    developed the theory of Markov chains as a way to model such processes.

    an area of NLP (Natural Language Processing) that is commonly used in the tech
    industry by companies like Google, LinkedIn, and Instagram. When you’re writing
    emails, Google predicts and suggests words or phrases to [autocomplete](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/autocomplete-authorship)
    your email. And when you receive messages on Instagram or LinkedIn, those apps
    suggest potential replies. These are the applications of a Markov chain we will
    explore. That said, the types of models these large-scale companies use in production
    for these features are more complicated.

    the spread of diseases, and the behavior of financial markets.

    given the current state. For example, if the stock's price is currently increasing,
    there is a 60% chance that it will continue to increase, a 30% chance that it
    will decrease, and a 10% chance that it will remain stable.

    use it to predict the future evolution of the stock's price by simulating the
    transitions between states. At each time step, we would use the current state
    and the transition probabilities to determine the probability of transitioning
    to each possible next state.

- en: One limitation of Markov chains is that they are only applicable to systems
    that exhibit memoryless behavior. This means that the future behavior of the system
    is not influenced by its past behavior. If the system does exhibit memory, then
    a Markov chain may not be the most appropriate tool for modeling its behavior.
  id: totrans-25

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another limitation of Markov chains is that they can only model systems that
    have a finite number of states. If the system can take on an infinite number of
    states, then a Markov chain may not be able to accurately model its behavior.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Markov chains can only model systems that exhibit stationary behavior, where
    the transition probabilities between states do not change over time. If the transition
    probabilities do change over time, then a more complex model may be required to
    accurately capture the behavior of the system.
