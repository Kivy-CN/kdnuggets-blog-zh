- en: Our Solar System formed around 4600 million years ago. We know this from the
    study of meteorites and radioactivity. It all began with a cloud of gas and dust.
    A nearby supernova explosion probably perturbed the calm cloud, which then started
    to contract due to gravity, forming a flat, rotating disk with most of the material
    concentrated in the center: [**the protosun**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar).
    Later, gravity pulled the rest of the material into clumps and rounded some of
    them, forming the planets and dwarf planets. The leftovers resulted in comets,
    asteroids, and meteoroids.

    exoplanets — planets outside of the Solar System — do we expect to exist? Why
    are some stars surrounded by planets? How diverse are planetary systems? Does
    this diversity tell us something about the process of planet formation? These
    are some of the many questions that motivate the study of exoplanets. Some exoplanets
    may have the necessary physical conditions (amount and quality of light from the
    star, temperature, atmospheric composition) for the existence of complex organic
    chemistry and perhaps for the development of Life (which may be quite different
    from Life on Earth).

    other planets in books and film for centuries, but detecting actual exoplanets
    is a recent phenomenon. Planets on their own emit very little if any light. We
    can only see Jupiter or Venus in the night sky because they reflect the sun’s
    light. If we were to look at an exoplanet (the nearest one is over 4 light-years
    away), it would be very close to a brilliantly lit star, making the planet impossible
    to see.

    themselves do not emit light, but the stars around which they orbit do. Considering
    this fact into account scientists at NASA developed a method which they called
    Transit method in which a digital-camera-like technology is used to detect and
    measure tiny dips in a star’s brightness as a planet crosses in front of the star.
    With observations of transiting planets, astronomers can calculate the ratio of
    a planet’s radius to that of its star — essentially the size of the planet’s shadow
    — and with that ratio, they can calculate the planet’s size.

    than a thousand exoplanets. Then came the Kepler mission, and the number of exoplanets
    exploded. The Kepler mission is sadly over in 2018, but the [**TESS**](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/tess/)** mission** **or
    Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite** has taken its place and is regularly finding
    new exoplanets in the night sky. TESS is monitoring the brightness of stars for
    periodic drops caused by planet transits. The TESS mission is finding planets
    ranging from small, rocky worlds to giant planets, showcasing the diversity of
    planets in the galaxy.

    In its most general form, under some conditions (which include finite [variance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)),
    it states that averages of samples of observations of random variables independently
    drawn from the same distribution converge in distribution to the normal, that
    is, they become normally distributed when the number of observations is sufficiently
    large. Physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent
    processes often have distributions that are nearly normal.

    Earth to detect exoplanets by imaging and velocity variations of the stars. Satellite
    telescopes including Cheops, [JWST](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/), Plato, and Ariel,
    will be launched to detect planets by the transit method. The JWST will also do
    direct imaging. Large Space telescopes 8 to18m in diameter (LUVOIR, Habex) are
    being designed at NASA to detect signs of life on exoplanets by 2050.

    make detailed maps of planets. And possibly, interstellar probes will be launched
    towards the nearest exoplanets to take close-up images. Engineers are already
    working on propulsion techniques to reach such distant targets.
