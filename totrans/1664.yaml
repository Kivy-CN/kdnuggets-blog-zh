    get back to running, one of my favorite activities. Now, you may be thinking "what
    the heck does this have to do with Data Science?", but during my recovery I found
    more parallels than you might think. I started to make the connection a few months
    into rehab, with all of the squats, icing, balancing drills, and massages. Getting
    back into running shape was so similar to the tasks I had to do on a daily basis
    to build a strong data science culture. Even more, I came to realize that data
    science today is much like preparing for and running a marathon (something few
    do, and even less do well).

    about whether or not machine learning could actually deliver business value. And
    this criticism is not without merit. In the ten years that ML/AI has been widely
    known, only in the past few years have [C-level executives stated that they are

    Were the concepts of machine learning just ahead of the computing power that was
    available ten years ago and it’s only now catching up? Or is there something else
    at play?

- en: Data science, surprisingly perhaps, is not about designing the most advanced
    machine learning algorithms and training them on all of the data (and then having
    Skynet). It’s about finding the right data, becoming a quasi-expert on the process,
    system, or event you are trying to model, and crafting features that will help
    quirky and sometimes frail statistical algorithms make accurate predictions. Very
    little time is actually spent on the algorithm itself. Of course, there are exceptions
    to this, but even in those areas most of the research today is done by a few people
    (and/or companies) like Google, Facebook, etc. who are advancing the technical
    aspects of the field. Everyone only starts using the new algorithms after they
    are neatly packaged in open source software. A recent study of industry data scientists
    shows that 79% of their time is spent collecting, organizing, and cleaning data
    (60% cleaning and organizing, and 19% collecting data), empirically [confirming
    that there is a lot of marathon preparation going on](http://visit.crowdflower.com/rs/416-ZBE-142/images/CrowdFlower_DataScienceReport_2016.pdf).
    But when does the actual race start? This presents a very different view of what
    is going on behind the scenes, and points to a possible reason for the delay in
    value mentioned earlier.

    some challenges immediately become apparent. After asking a few questions, you
    quickly find out that it will take a herculean effort to get the right information
    in the right place so it can be fed to a machine learning algorithm. This was
    especially true ten years ago, but is still very common today.

    and no ability to link data points across the organization, you start to hear
    things like, “oh… You need to talk to Jeff about the sales pipeline data” or “Beth,
    in DevOps… she’s the only one who has that information”. Once you start to learn
    more about the business, inevitably you discover that some critical pieces of
    information are not being tracked or stored. Or even worse, you need to develop
    a way to gather data that previously wasn’t available. This may sound dramatic,
    but this is the reality of the experience of many data scientists when they start
    at a company that's just getting into machine learning. It’s no coincidence that
    the same study mentioned earlier shows that [78% of data scientists say their
    least favorite part of the job is collecting, organizing, and cleaning data](http://visit.crowdflower.com/rs/416-ZBE-142/images/CrowdFlower_DataScienceReport_2016.pdf)

    under, it becomes more and more evident that machine learning isn’t actually the
    innovation that is driving companies using machine learning to be successful.
    Of course, there are industries that can and are benefiting greatly from machine
    learning (think self-driving cars, natural language processing, voice recognition,
    and the like). However, for the vast majority of companies, machine learning is
    an attractive hammer, and everyone thinks they have a shiny nail. Those companies
    might perceive their success as coming from machine learning magic, but it could
    be derived from another source.

    is driving that success? I don’t believe they are making false claims of success,

    experts in-house, they are fundamentally changing how the company operates. These

- en: For the simple fact that machine learning doesn’t work until all (or most) of
    the company’s data “ducks” are in a row, these individuals lead a company to take
    action that would otherwise not be taken. In addition, data scientists begin thinking
    critically about how both products and business decisions can be informed in a
    data-driven way. This is a dramatic shift in the way most companies operate, and
    we haven’t even mentioned machine learning yet! I believe that this shift (organizing
    a company’s data, thinking critically about what data they have or could have,
    and making that data actionable and available) is the real innovation that machine
    learning has catalyzed.

    these data-driven principles is quite difficult to do in practice. Let's take
    a look at some of the road blocks our team at CloudZero have encountered while
    on the way to building a data-driven product and company.
  prefs: []

- en: At CloudZero, the team is putting forth a ton of effort to make sense of disparate
    data sources from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide a holistic view of our
    clients’ web deployments. Being able to visualize and predict website reliability,
    our core value, isn’t an easy task and requires a lot of preparation. We are still
    in the training phase of our marathon, but fortunately we are investing heavily
    in getting the right data in the right place, a task that is cited as most [critical
    to machine learning success](https://hbr.org/2018/04/if-your-data-is-bad-your-machine-learning-tools-are-useless).

    and resources within a cloud environment and making them searchable by machines
    **and humans**. It also means figuring out the true actor for events that occur
    in client environments, tracing activities back through chains of “AssumeRole”
    events (If you’re familiar with AWS, you’ll know the pain). Finally, it means
    being able to connect the dots between resources and how they communicate with
    one another, demonstrating dependencies and areas of potential risk.
  prefs: []

- en: We recognize that these critical pieces of information are required to be able
    to contextualize the reliability of any cloud deployment and must be coordinated
    with our machine learning and data science efforts. Although these tasks are not
    easy, we are taking them head-on with the knowledge that a data-first approach
    will provide us with many opportunities to innovate in the industry.

    from the way we interact with our devices, communicate with one another, and conduct
    business around the world. But when you dissect it a little bit more, you begin
    to see all of the things that enable its success. It may sound blasphemous to
    say, but it’s important for companies to recognize that with some basic statistics
    and meaningful organization of their data, they're already 95% of the way there.
    Machine learning undeniably adds a little extra flair (and accuracy) to the final
    product, but here's the dirty little secret, it's not necessary to be successful.

    of machine learning researchers. In fact, I believe understanding these realities
    increases the importance of their role as change agents within an organization.
    Without their constant thirst for clean and meaningful data, and the vision to
    do something groundbreaking with it, companies would likely never make moves to
    organize their data beyond the status quo.
