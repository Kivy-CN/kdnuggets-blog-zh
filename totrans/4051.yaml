- en: Infinite iterators, as the name suggests, are special types of iterators that
    can continue generating values indefinitely. Unlike the in-built iterators like
    lists, tuples, and dictionaries that eventually reach an end, infinite iterators
    can produce an unending stream of values. Such iterators are also sometimes referred
    to as infinite generators or sequences. They find use in various scenarios for
    solving problems involving simulation, generating sequences, processing real-time
    data, and more.

    controller system that continuously cycles through different lights. No different
    actions are performed while cycling through the different colored lights. We will
    use a wait time of 5 seconds to display our results.

    that it will print endlessly unless you explicitly specify a finite number. For
    example, if you need to generate the number "9" three times, then the following

- en: These infinite iterators are extremely helpful in scenarios when we need to
    work with streams of data. The “count”, “cycle” and “repeat” iterators provide
    us the ability to solve problems more efficiently and elegantly. Although using
    them requires necessary caution as they can lead to infinite loops, when used
    thoughtfully they can be a valuable resource for solving programming problems.
