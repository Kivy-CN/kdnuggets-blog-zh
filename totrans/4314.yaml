    of my all-time favorite books on machine learning. Doesn’t only cover the theoretical
    mathematical derivations but also showcases the implementation of algorithms through
    examples. You should solve the exercises given at the end of each chapter.'

    can start off by completing this specialization offered by deeplearning.ai and
    the Hands-ON book. This is not as important from a data science perspective unless
    you are planning to solve a computer vision or NLP problem.
