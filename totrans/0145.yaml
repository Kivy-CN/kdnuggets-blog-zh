    Every week or month, something new drops and now you’re here learning something
    new, again!

- en: GPT-4 was released in March 2023, and since then everybody has been waiting
    for the release of GPT-5\. Siqi Chen [tweeted](https://twitter.com/blader/status/1640217165822578688)
    on March 27th saying that “gpt5 is scheduled to complete training this December.”
    However, this statement has been clarified by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at an [MIT
    event](https://www.imaginationinaction.co/the-future-of-business-with-ai) in April
    when asked about GPT-5 stating “We are not and won’t for some time,”.

- en: So that clarifies that. However, some experts have suggested that OpenAI release
    a GPT-4.5, an intermediate release between GPT-4 and GPT-5 by Q3/Q4 of 2023\.
    Improvements are always being made to current models and this could be a potential
    release of GPT-4.5\. Many are saying that GPT-4.5 has multimodal capability potential,
    which has already been demonstrated in GPT-4 developer livestream in March 2023.

- en: Although there are high expectations for GPT-5, GPT-4 still needs to iron out
    some of its creases. For example, GPT-4’s inference time is very high along with
    it being computationally expensive to run. There are other challenges such as
    accessing the GPT-4 APIs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although there is work to do, what we can say is that each of the GPT releases
    has pushed the boundaries of AI technology and what it is capable of. AI enthusiasts
    are excited to explore GPT-5's groundbreaking features.

- en: This is all about trust, the main reason why most users do not believe in AI
    models. For example, GPT-4 scored 40% higher than GPT-3.5 in internal factual
    evaluations under all nine categories, as shown in the image below. This means
    that GPT-4 is less likely to respond to disallowed content, and 40% more likely
    to produce factual reponses, in comparison to GPT-3.5.

    GPT-5 will reduce hallucination to less than 10%, making LLMs more trustworthy.

- en: As stated earlier on, GPT-4 is very computationally expensive, at $0.03 per
    token. This is in comparison to GPT-3.5’s cost of $0.002\. That is a big difference.
    GPT-4 being trained on a one trillion parameter dataset and infrastructure reflects
    the cost.

- en: Whereas Google’s PaLM 2 model is only trained on 340 billion parameters and
    has efficient performance. If OpenAI plans to compete with Google's PaLM 2, they
    will need to look into ways of reducing the cost, and the size of GPT-4 parameters
    - all whilst being able to maintain performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another aspect to look into is a better inference time, for the time it takes
    a deep learning model to predict new data. The more features and plugins within
    GPT-4, the more compute efficiency becomes. Developers are already complaining
    to OpenAI that GPT-4 APIs frequently stop responding, which forces them to use
    GPT-3.5.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taking all of that into consideration, we can expect OpenAI to overcome these
    challenges with a GPT-5 release that is smaller, cheaper and more efficient.

    multimodal capabilities. Although it has not been added to GPT-4 yet, this is
    where GPT-5 may come and be the star of the show and truly make it multimodal.

- en: Not only can we expect it to deal with images and text, but also audio, videos,
    temperature, and more. Sam Altman stated in an interview *“I’m very excited to
    see what happens when we can do video, there’s a lot of video content in the world.
    There are a lot of things that are much easier to learn with a video than text.”*

    with the world releasing model after model, we have models such as Story Writer
    that can output 65 thousand tokens.

    longer context length, allowing users to have AI friends that can remember their
    persona and history for years.

- en: Being a large language model (LLM), the first thing we can expect is an improvement
    and enhanced ability in understanding context. If we merge this with the point
    above about long-term memory, GPT-5 could have the potential to maintain context
    over long conversations. As a user, you will have more catered and meaningful
    responses that are consistent with your requirements.

    of natural language being emotion. Potential capabilities of contextual understanding
    in GPT-5 can allow it to be more empathetic and produce appropriate replies to
    continue to engage in the conversation.

    article is based on the current challenges that GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 face, and how
    OpenAI can use these hurdles to overcome and produce a high performant release
    of GPT-5.
