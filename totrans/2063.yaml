- en: Everywhere you look these days, IT organizations are looking to the cloud to
    solve their data storage, movement, and analytics challenges…and with good reason!
    Cloud services from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others have revolutionized how
    we think about data, from an IT and an end user perspective. They’ve vastly reduced
    the function of the corporate data center, which is rarely a core competency of
    the organization. They’ve democratized access to data, analytics, and processing
    power. They’ve disrupted how we think about the costs involved with data warehousing
    and analytics. Cloud is all these things and more, so it’s no wonder many organizations
    are rushing to push their big data operations into the cloud. Cost savings, performance
    improvement, and streamlined operations are all well and good, but what happens
    when you actually get down to doing the work? Chances are your data engineers
    will be new to whatever cloud technology your organization decides to utilize.
    This article details my own experience as a data engineer being exposed to Google
    BigQuery (GBQ) for the first time.

- en: 'I’ve been a data engineer for many years and I’ve worked with most flavors
    of RDBMS and SQL in my career. A recent project had my coworkers and I redesigning
    an existing SQL Server database into GBQ, which inspired me to write this article
    as a resource for fellow data engineers new to GBQ. Here are some things that
    might take some getting used to, along with mitigation strategies where I’ve found
    them:'

- en: '**Case Sensitivity** - Unlike most RDBMS, BigQuery is case sensitive, not only
    for string comparison, but for object names as well. For string comparison, using
    The UPPER function on both sides (or one side of comparing to a literal) will
    eliminate the effect of case sensitivity.  Curiously, although object names are
    case sensitive when referenced in a FROM clause, column names are not case sensitive.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fully Qualified Object Names** - All object names referenced in the FROM
    clause must be fully qualified to the dataset level, or the project level if they
    don''t exist in your current billing project.  Not only that, but the entire fully
    qualified name must be enclosed in backwards single quotes (usually shares a key
    with the tilde). You will absolutely spend several frustrated minutes at some
    point trying to figure out why a query errors out until you realize one of those
    quotes doesn’t look like the other.'

- en: '**Standard SQL vs. Legacy SQL** - BigQuery has two flavors of SQL, for some
    reason. Standard SQL is very much like ANSI SQL and is what you should use. However,
    the classic BigQuery Web UI (which I prefer for reasons I’ll get into shortly)
    defaults to Legacy SQL. There’s an option to use Standard SQL, and there’s also
    a Chrome extension called BigQuery Mate that will let you skip that step.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**No Stored Procedures or Functions** - This is a big one and there’s really
    no easy way around it. Google provides tools with which to do ETL and data transformation
    and preparation, but they don’t offer the flexibility of coding your own procedures. 
    Functions can be created, but they are temporary, only existing for a single session,
    which makes them very limited as a programming tool.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Classic UI vs. New UI** - The classic UI (the one that looks like Gmail)
    has one big advantage in that it allows you to add a project to which you don''t
    have explicit named access to the object browser. For some reason, the new UI
    doesn’t have that feature. It does however, default to Standard SQL, which can
    save you a few headaches.  Both are fine, but neither is perfect.'

- en: '**No Query Plan Estimates** - You have to wonder if whoever runs Google’s Cloud
    Services division was a doctor in a past life.  What other industry would perform
    a service without explaining the cost first? That’s essentially what Google is
    doing here, albeit in a less predatory manner. Simply put, there is no way to
    determine if your complex query will run efficiently until you actually run it.
    Once you run the query, the execution plan is actually very helpful and actionable.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Limited DDL Capability** - There is very little ability to alter a table
    once it exists.  You can''t remove a column or change a datatype.  You can''t
    rename fields or tables.   Nearly any table or view altering operation involves
    a "CREATE TABLE AS SELECT" type of operation, meaning you technically will end
    up with a "new" table or view.'

    quite a bit. That''s not the case at all. These are, for the most part, annoyances
    that new GBQ developers will encounter and overcome. There''s actually a lot to
    like, too. Here are some pleasant surprises that I encountered during my first
    GBQ project:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Automatic Object Expiration** - This one''s for the lazy DBA who always has
    25 temp tables covered with dust in the corner of his/her database.  In GBQ, you
    can (and should) create a dataset and specify a short object lifespan.  This way,
    you can have a sandbox environment that cleans itself up and you don''t need to
    worry about incurring additional storage charges for data you no longer need.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Query History** - GBQ logs all of the queries you run for billing purposes
    of course, but it also exposes them to you in an easily searchable list.  This
    can be extremely handy if you ever lose track of a piece of code, which happens
    to the best of us.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Cached Query Results** - Google charges to store data and in most cases to
    retrieve it as well.  If you''re like me, you may find yourself running the same
    query periodically during development.  GBQ will cache those results by default
    and your project will not be charged.  There is an option to turn this feature
    off in the Web UI options if you want.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Autocomplete** - Most query tools like TOAD or SQL Management Studio will
    autocomplete table and column names for you with varying degrees of success. 
    I''ve found that the GBQ Web UI autocomplete'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**GUI Based Table Creation** - Sometimes you just need to create a quick small
    table to store parameters or something like that.  The GBQ Web UI allows a user
    with no SQL skills the ability to create a table and add columns of various data
    types.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The upshot is that GBQ takes a little getting used to and still has one or two
    glaring functionality gaps, mainly related to the inability to create stored procedures
    or functions. However, the potential benefits of cloud data storage and analytics
    far outweigh these considerations. I continue to learn new shortcuts and techniques
    every day, and as I overcome the various small challenges, I can see the bright
    "cloudy" future in front of me.
