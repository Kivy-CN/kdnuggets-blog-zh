- en: Most NLP practitioners who are also readers of KDnuggets, I would assume, have
    come to natural language processing via the *computational* route (recall that
    *computational linguistics* is another term for what we also call NLP). That is,
    these practitioners will have a solid technical foundation. This is in direct
    contrast to trained linguists coming to NLP from the *linguistics* route. The
    likely difference in skill sets should be relatively apparent.
