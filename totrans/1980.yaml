    This enforced schema ensures that data remains consistent and can be relied upon
    for analysis.

    [star schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema), a central fact table
    contains transactional data, surrounded by dimension tables that provide context
    and attributes. In a [snowflake schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_schema),
    dimension tables are normalized to reduce redundancy. The choice between these
    schemas depends on the specific data warehousing requirements.
