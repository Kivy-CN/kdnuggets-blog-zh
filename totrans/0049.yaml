- en: I like to think of ChatGPT as a smarter version of StackOverflow. Very helpful,
    but not replacing professionals any time soon. As a former data scientist, I spent
    a solid amount of time playing around with ChatGPT when it came out. I was pretty
    impressed with its coding capacity. It could generate pretty useful code from
    scratch; it could offer suggestions on my own code. It was pretty good at debugging
    if I asked it to help me with an error message.

    its limitations. For any developers fearing ChatGPT will take their jobs, here’s
    a list of what ChatGPT can’t do.

    purely generated by ChatGPT and copy-pasted by you into a company product could
    expose your employer to an ugly lawsuit.

- en: This is because ChatGPT freely pulls code snippets from data it was trained
    on, which come from all over the internet. “I had chat gpt generate some code
    for me and I instantly recognized what GitHub repo it got a big chunk of it from,”

    license it was under. And even if it was generated fully from scratch, anything
    created by ChatGPT is not copyrightable itself. As Bloomberg Law writers Shawn
    Helms and Jason Krieser [put it](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/external/document/XDDQ1PNK000000/copyrights-professional-perspective-copyright-chaos-legal-implic),
    “A ‘derivative work’ is ‘a work based upon one or more preexisting works.’ ChatGPT
    is trained on preexisting works and generates output based on that training.”

    analysis in Python.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is it the right statistical analysis? Probably not. ChatGPT doesn’t know if
    the data meets the assumptions needed for the test results to be valid. ChatGPT
    also doesn’t know what stakeholders want to see.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I might ask ChatGPT to help me figure out if there's a statistically
    significant difference in satisfaction ratings across different age groups. ChatGPT
    suggests an independent sample T-test and finds no statistically significant difference
    in age groups. But the t-test isn't the best choice here for several reasons,
    like the fact that there might be multiple age groups, or that the data aren’t
    normally distributed.

    would know what assumptions to check and what kind of test to run, and could conceivably
    give ChatGPT more specific instructions. But ChatGPT on its own will happily generate
    the correct code for the wrong statistical analysis, rendering the results unreliable
    and unusable.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any data scientist will tell you that part of the job is understanding and interpreting
    stakeholder priorities on a project. ChatGPT, or any AI for that matter, cannot
    fully grasp or manage those.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For one, stakeholder priorities often involve complex decision-making that takes
    into account not just data, but also human factors, business goals, and market
    trends.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, in an app redesign, you might find the marketing team wants to
    prioritize user engagement features, the sales team is pushing for features that
    support cross-selling, and the customer support team needs better in-app support
    features to assist users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT can provide information and generate reports, but it can't make nuanced
    decisions that align with the varied – and sometimes competing – interests of
    different stakeholders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Plus, stakeholder management often requires a high degree of emotional intelligence
    – the ability to empathize with stakeholders, understand their concerns on a human
    level, and respond to their emotions. ChatGPT lacks emotional intelligence and
    cannot manage the emotional aspects of stakeholder relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may not think of that as a coding task, but the data scientist currently
    working on the code for that new feature rollout knows just how much of it is
    working with stakeholder priorities.

- en: Want to know how to change the legend size on your R graph? No problem – ChatGPT
    can pull from the 1,000s of StackOverflow answers to questions asking the same
    thing. But (using an example I asked ChatGPT to generate), what about something
    it’s unlikely to have come across before, such as organizing a community potluck
    where each person's dish must contain an ingredient that starts with the same
    letter as their last name and you want to make sure there's a good variety of
    dishes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I tested this prompt, it gave me some Python code that decided the *name*
    of the dish had to match the last name, not even capturing the ingredient requirement
    correctly. It also wanted me to come up with 26 dish categories, one per letter
    of the alphabet. It was not a smart answer, probably because it was a completely
    novel problem.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last but not least, ChatGPT cannot code ethically. It doesn't possess the ability
    to make value judgments or understand the moral implications of a piece of code
    in the way a human does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ethical coding involves considering how code might affect different groups of
    people, ensuring that it doesn't discriminate or cause harm, and making decisions
    that align with ethical standards and societal norms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you ask ChatGPT to write code for a loan approval system, it
    might churn out a model based on historical data. However, it cannot understand
    the societal implications of that model potentially denying loans to marginalized
    communities due to biases in the data. It would be up to the human developers
    to recognize the need for fairness and equity, to seek out and correct biases
    in the data, and to ensure that the code aligns with ethical practices.
  prefs: []

- en: It’s worth pointing out that people aren’t perfect at it, either – someone coded
    [Amazon’s biased recruitment tool](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G),
    and someone coded the [Google photo categorization](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai)
    that identified Black people as gorillas. But humans are better at it. ChatGPT
    lacks the empathy, conscience, and moral reasoning needed to code ethically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Humans can understand the broader context, recognize the subtleties of human
    behavior, and have discussions about right and wrong. We participate in ethical
    debates, weigh the pros and cons of a particular approach, and be held accountable
    for our decisions. When we make mistakes, we can learn from them in a way that
    contributes to our moral growth and understanding.

- en: I’ve found ChatGPT is great at debugging, some code review, and being just a
    bit faster than searching for that StackOverflow answer. But so much of “coding”
    is more than just punching Python into a keyboard. It’s knowing what your business’s
    goals are. It’s understanding how careful you have to be with algorithmic decisions.
    It’s building relationships with stakeholders, truly understanding what they want
    and why, and looking for a way to make that possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s storytelling, it’s knowing when to choose a pie chart or a bar graph, and
    it’s understanding the narrative that data is trying to tell you. It's about being
    able to communicate complex ideas in simple terms that stakeholders can understand
    and make decisions upon.
