    tools allow data scientists to access and use it more quickly. Data scientists
    can obtain a better knowledge of the data and its underlying relationships by
    developing data models, which can then be used to construct predictive models
    and other data-driven solutions.'

    because it helps ensure that the database is able to efficiently store and retrieve
    the data, and is able to handle the expected volume and complexity of data. Data
    modeling tools are computer programmes used to create, design and manage data
    models. A data model is a graphical depiction of the structure of a database that
    describes the relationships between different types of data. Users can use data
    modeling tools to design, visualise, and edit data models. Database administrators,
    data analysts, and other IT professionals use them to build and describe database
    systems.
