    extract meaningful insights. Let’s enter into the new category of ML-based learning,
    i.e., Unsupervised learning, in which one of the powerful algorithms to solve
    the clustering tasks is the K-Means clustering algorithm which revolutionizes

    In this article, we will deep dive into the workings of K-Means, its implementation
    using Python, and exploring its principles, applications, etc. So, let's start
    the journey to unlock the secret patterns and harness the potential of the K-Means
    clustering algorithm.

    each observation in the dataset to the cluster with the minimum distance, which
    is the prototype of the clustering algorithm. This clustering algorithm is commonly
    used in Data mining and machine learning for data partitioning into K clusters
    based on similarity metrics. Therefore, in this algorithm, we have to minimize
    the sum of squares distance between the observations and their corresponding centroids,
    which eventually results in distinct and homogeneous clusters.

    while implementing the algorithm. The K value signifies how many clusters we must
    create for our dataset. Finding this value intuitively is not possible, so to
    find the optimal value, we are going to create a plot between WCSS(within-cluster-sum-of-squares)
    and different K-values, and we have to choose that K, which gives us the minimum
    value of WCSS.

    it is an unsupervised problem. After that, we will create an object of KMeans
    class with a selected K value and then fit that on the dataset provided. Finally,
    we print the y_means, which indicates the means of different clusters formed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This completes our discussion. We have discussed the K-Means working, implementation,
    and applications. In conclusion, implementing the clustering tasks is a widely
    used algorithm from the class of unsupervised learning that provides a simple
    and intuitive approach to grouping the observations of a dataset. The main strength
    of this algorithm is to divide the observations into multiple sets based on the
    selected similarity metrics with the help of the user who is implementing the
    algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, based on the selection of centroids in the first step, our algorithm
    behaves differently and converges to local or global optima. Therefore, selecting
    the number of clusters to implement the algorithm, preprocessing the data, handling
    outliers, etc., is crucial to obtain good results. But if we observe the other
    side of this algorithm behind the limitations, K-Means is a helpful technique
    for exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition in various fields.
