- en: The past few years has been like a dream come true for those who work in analytics
    and big data. There is a new career path for platform engineers to learn Hadoop,
    Scala and Spark. Java and Python programmers have a chance to move to the Big
    Data world. There they find higher salaries, new challenges and get to scale up
    to distributed systems. But recently I am starting to hear some complaints and
    dashed hopes from engineers who have spent time working there.

    time in ETL, preparing data sets for analysts, and coding models developed by
    data scientists into scripts. So, they have become cogs between data scientists
    and big data.

    from Kaggle competitions. Even minor tasks require Python and Scala skills as
    well as multiple interactions and design sessions with big data engineers and
    operation teams.

    through tutorials. They grow weary of being given nothing more to do than deploy
    the next Hadoop cluster through the Cloudera wizard and semi-automated Ansible
    scripts.

- en: In this environment, the big data engineer will never get to work on scalability
    and storage optimization. Data scientists will never invent a new algorithm. And
    the DevOps engineer will never put the entire platform on autopilot. The risk
    for the team is their ideas might not make it beyond proof of concept.

    think not just about abstractions but need to consider the practical issues of

    long their query will run and whether the data they extract will fit into the
    storage mechanism they are using.'

    data exploration and data preparation. Then he moves to model development. Next
    comes deployment and validating the environment.  Finally there is the push to
    production. Given the proper tools, he or she could run this complete iteration
    multiple times a day without relying on the Big Data engineer.

    developing and contributing to tools like Spark, enabling streaming architectures
