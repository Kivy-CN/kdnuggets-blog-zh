    due to my lack of knowledge of underlying math and statistics concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of those concepts was A/B testing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While I excelled at the coding portion of the interview, I’d often freeze up
    when asked questions on inferential statistics and experiment design.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To bridge this knowledge gap, I took the [free A/B testing course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257),
    taught by senior data professionals at Google.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this article, I will break down what I learned in the course and explain
    how you can use it to build an understanding of inferential statistics.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say your company wants to launch a new type of candy alongside the existing
    dessert being sold.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The hypothesis is that new candy will drive more users to stores worldwide,
    leading to an increase in total sales.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before launching this new candy in all of its stores, the company needs to understand
    whether it’s profitable to do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It must first test this hypothesis on a few stores, and only expand production
    if there indeed is an increase in sales.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where A/B testing comes in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, A/B testing compares two versions of something to figure out
    which is better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'An A/B test typically comprises the following components:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sell the new candy. It is also known as the control group.'
  prefs:

    this includes the group of stores that offer the new candy. It is called the treatment
    group.'

    the hypothesis in our example: “Stores that sell the new candy will see higher
    average sales than the stores that don’t.”'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    hypothesis, which will be covered in this free course.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will learn how A/B testing is being used at large companies like Netflix,
    Amazon, and Google.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of A/B testing from instructors who work as statisticians and engineers at Google.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Inferential Statistics and Experiment Design
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The course then covers everything you need to know about experiment design — from
    the metrics you’d like to measure, to concepts like confidence intervals and statistical
    significance.
  prefs: []

- en: 3\. Policy and Ethics for Experiments
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This lesson will cover the ethical considerations involved in conducting experiments — understanding
    whether participants of the experiment are being exposed to risk and obtaining
    user consent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. How to Size an Experiment
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will learn to determine an appropriate sample size for the experiment, which
    involves measures like statistical power, significance levels, standard deviation,
    and the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If these concepts sound foreign to you, don’t worry!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but was able to follow along easily thanks to the additional learning material
    and notes provided.

- en: 5\. How to Analyze the Results of an Experiment
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here, you will learn about the types of metrics that must be constant across
    all groups in your experiment. These are called invariants.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will also learn to analyze whether the result of an experiment is statistically
    significant — for both single and multiple metric experiments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6\. Turning Results into Actionable Insight
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, you will learn to use the results of an A/B test to make a
    business decision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you find that stores selling the new candy do experience a significant
    improvement in sales, what’s the next step?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you roll out multiple batches of this new candy to all stores worldwide?
    Or do you start with a single state or country?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps you’d like to iterate on the experiment based on the data you’ve gathered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This section of the course is heavily focused on the business impact of A/B
    testing and aids with the decision-making process once the test has been conducted.

- en: 7\. Final Project
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the final project, you will be provided with real data from an actual experiment
    that was run by Udacity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using this data, you’ll have to answer a set of questions on experiment design — you
    will be asked to calculate metrics like the standard deviation, experiment duration,
    and sample size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After answering all the questions about the dataset, you’ve got to make a final
    recommendation as to whether you would launch the experiment given the analysis
    conducted.

    expecting it to be math-heavy and hard to grasp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To my surprise (and delight), it was more business-centric and focused on the
    practical implementation of A/B tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to start performing A/B tests and would like to understand how to
    define a hypothesis, choose a sample size, and other experiment parameters, this
    course will help you get up and running quickly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also recommend the course for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding
    of statistical inference and experiment design, as knowledge of these concepts
    will help you ace data science and analytics interviews.
