    I described two aspects of “critical thinking,” which according to many data science
    hiring managers, is the most desired skill they’re looking for. To test critical
    thinking, hiring managers use case interviews. Case interviews have long been
    popular with management consulting companies; they involve a free-ranging dialogue
    between the job-seeker and the hiring manager about a business problem – in the
    case of a data science interview, the business problem is expected to be solved
    using data-driven insights.

- en: Case interviews scare many graduates who have never seen a test that does not
    have an answer key. In industry, any problem worth solving does not come with
    an answer key. Critical thinking is the antithesis of formulaic thinking. The
    best way to master case interviews is to practice, practice, practice.

    and collaborate on your answers. With five people, your answers should cover most
    possibilities. Then find a hiring manager who’s willing to give you feedback.
    Remember: you are judged not only on the contents but the presentation.'

    service achievement, or other types of forgeries.

- en: '**Where is the answer key?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are asking for an answer key, you’ve missed the point about case interviews.
    Case interviews are open-ended by design. If these questions have answer keys,
    then they’d be useless to assess critical thinking. The hiring manager is listening
    for how you approach problems, and structure the analysis.

- en: Try your answer out on a few friends, or better, a hiring manager. Then, try
    again. If you’re doing it right, these different attempts should move along different
    paths, because the interview questions are designed to be open-ended.

    data, or all the right data, which means you need to make sensible assumptions,
    and keep moving along. A good case interview is a dialogue – you gather more information
    by asking your interviewer questions.
