    by marketing researchers and often used interchangeably. What do these terms mean
    to you?**'

- en: '**Bing Liu:** My understanding is that the two terms mean the same thing. People
    from academia use the term text mining, especially data mining researchers, while
    text analytics is mainly used in industry. I seldom see academics use the term
    text analytics. There is another closely related term, called natural language
    processing (NLP). Text mining and text analytics usually refer to the application
    of data mining and machine learning algorithms to text data. NLP covers that and
    also other more traditional natural language tasks such as machine translation,
    syntax, semantics, etc. But there is really no clear demarcation between the terms.'

    has evolved over time?'

- en: '**BL:** It comes from three research areas: information retrieval, data mining,
    and natural language processing (NLP). Information retrieval started in the 1970s.
    It mainly deals with text retrieval. That is, given a query, which can be a few
    keywords or a full document, we want to find related documents from a text collection
    or corpus. Web search engines are giant information retrieval systems.'

- en: Traditional data mining uses structured data such as database tables. In the
    late 1990s, researchers started to use text as data, which gave rise to text mining.
    Early text mining basically applied data mining and machine learning algorithms
    on text data without using NLP techniques such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging,
    summarization, etc.

- en: NLP has a much longer history. It started in the 1950s and its objective is
    to make computers understand human language. As text mining research expanded
    its scope in the past 10 years or so, it started to use natural language processing
    techniques such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging, coreference resolution, etc.
    Judging from topics covered in natural language process conferences, text mining
    has now become a part of natural language processing. My own research started
    with traditional data mining. I then worked on sentiment analysis or opinion mining,
    which led me to natural language processing.

- en: 'BL: Text analytics has been used widely in marketing and many other fields.
    I am most familiar with the application of sentiment analysis. In marketing, marketers
    often want to know consumer opinions about their company’s products and their
    competitors'' products. Such opinions can be obtained by analyzing online reviews
    or other forms of social media postings about those products. Based on these opinions,
    marketers can formulate their marketing messages to suit different segments of
    the market. Public opinions are also very useful in many other application domains,
    e.g., stock market prediction, consumer sentiment prediction, political election
    prediction, etc.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**BL:** It all depends what task one is interested in. Some tasks are done
    reasonably well, e.g., named entity recognition. But many other tasks still need
    a lot of improvement in accuracy. The ultimate challenge is natural language understanding.
    Although researchers have worked on it for a long time, progress has not been
    great. Current text analytics techniques are still mainly based on traditional
    linguistics rules and statistical machine learning and data mining algorithms.
    These methods are still not able to achieve true understanding. Due to this problem,
    most text analytics tasks still have relatively low accuracy.'

    Progress in other AI areas such as machine learning and data mining are making
    a big impact on text analytics. I would say that the main progress of text analytics
    in the past twenty years has come from better machine learning techniques.'

    text analytics in academia. I am not sure about industry. The only thing that
    I know is that people can have very high expectations about text analytics, but
    it is a very challenging problem if you want to do it well and accurately.'

    be able to do that it cannot do now? Are there some things that will be impossible
    for text analytics for the foreseeable future?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**BL:** Let''s talk about natural language processing rather than text analytics,
    as advanced text analytics requires natural language processing. As machine learning
    such as deep learning progresses, we will certainly see better text analytics
    algorithms with much better accuracy than we can achieve today. But understanding
    natural language like we humans do is very unlikely in the foreseeable future
    because natural language is highly abstract. Every sentence we write has a great
    deal of commonsense knowledge behind it that we assume the reader knows. Clearly,
    a computer program does not know this. Learning, representing, and reasoning about
    commonsense knowledge is a major challenge.'
