- en: Have you ever used a smart assistant (think something like Siri or Alexa) to
    answer questions for you? The answer is more than likely "yes", which means that
    you are, on some level, already familiar with what's known as natural language
    processing (NLP).

- en: NLP is the combination of methods taken from different disciplines that smart
    assistants like Siri and Alexa use to make sense of the questions we ask them.
    It combines disciplines such as artificial intelligence and computer science to
    make it easier for human beings to talk with computers the way we would with another
    person. This idea of having a facsimile of a human conversation with a machine
    goes back to a [groundbreaking paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence)
    written by Alan Turing -- a paper that formed the basis for NLP technology that
    we use today.

- en: Specifically, these components are called natural language understanding (NLU)
    and natural language generation (NLG). This article aims to quickly cover the
    similarities and differences between NLP, NLU, and NLG and talk about what the
    future for NLP holds.

- en: Data scientists and artificial intelligence experts can use NLP to turn sets
    of unstructured data into formats that computers can convert to speech and text
    -- they can even go so far as to create responses that are contextually relevant
    to a question you ask them (think back again to virtual assistants like Siri and
    Alexa). But how, exactly, do NLU and NLG fit into NLP?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One similarity that all three of these disciplines share is that they work with
    natural language, even though they all play separate roles. So what's the difference
    between all three?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Think of it this way: whereas NLU seeks to understand the language that we
    as humans speak, NLP tracks down the most important bits of data to structure
    it into things such as numbers and text; It can even help with malicious [encryption
    traffic](https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/tls-vs-ssl/). NLG, meanwhile, takes
    sets of unstructured data to create narratives that we can understand as meaningful.'

- en: Natural language understanding relies on artificial intelligence to make sense
    of the info it ingests from speech or text. It does this to create something we
    can find meaningful from written words. Once data scientists use speech recognition
    to turn spoken words into written words, NLU [parses out the understandable meaning](/2019/07/nlp-vs-nlu-understanding-language-processing.html)
    from text regardless of whether that text includes mistakes and mispronunciation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NLU is important to data scientists because, without it, they wouldn't have
    the means to parse out meaning from tools such as speech and chatbots. We as humans,
    after all, are accustomed to striking up a conversation with a speech-enabled
    bot -- machines, however, don't have this luxury of convenience. On top of this,
    NLU can identify sentiments and obscenities from speech, just like you can. This
    means that with the power of NLU, data scientists can categorize text and meaningfully
    analyze different formats of content.

- en: Whereas natural language understanding seeks to parse through and make sense
    of unstructured information to turn it into usable data, NLG does quite the opposite.
    To that end, let's define NLG next and understand the ways data scientists apply
    it to real-world use cases.

    sets to create meaningful narratives understood through conversation. Essentially,
    NLG turns sets of data into a natural language that both you and I could understand.

- en: NLG is imbued with the experience of a real-life person so that it can generate
    output that is thoroughly researched and accurate [to the greatest possible extent](/2020/01/guide-natural-language-generation.html).
    This process goes back to the literature written by Alan Turing that we mentioned
    earlier, and it's essential to getting people to believe that a machine is holding
    a believable and natural conversation with them, regardless of what topic the
    discussion is based on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Organizations can use NLG to create conversational narratives that anyone across
    that organization can make use of. For example, NLG can be a huge boon to experts
    working in departments such as marketing, human resources, sales, and information
    technology -- NLG is most commonly applied to business intelligence dashboards,
    automated creation of content, and more efficient analysis of data.

    many organizations have struggled to embrace it widely. This is due in large part
    to a few key challenges: information overload, for one, plagues businesses on
    a regular basis and makes it difficult for them to say which sets of data are
    important amidst a seemingly endless sea of more data.'

- en: Additionally, businesses often require specific techniques and tools with which
    they can parse out useful information from data if they want to use NLP. And finally,
    NLP means that organizations need advanced machines if they want to process and
    maintain sets of data from different data sources using NLP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although challenges are preventing the majority of organizations from adopting
    NLP, it seems inevitable that these same organizations will eventually adopt NLP,
    NLU, and NLG to allow their machines to maintain believable, human-like interactions
    and conversations. There is, therefore, [a significant amount of investment](https://phrazor.ai/blog/augmented-analytics-futuristic-business-intelligence)
    occurring in NLP sub-fields of study like semantics and syntax.

    of natural language, and NLG creates and outputs more language; NLU assigns meaning
    to speech and text, and NLG outputs language with the help of machines. NLU extracts
    facts from language, while NLG takes the insights that NLU extracts in order to
    create natural language.'

    investing in NLP so that they can create human-like systems. The worldwide market
    for NLP is [set to eclipse $22 billion](https://omdia.tech.informa.com/) by 2025,
    so it's only a matter of time before these tech giants transform how humans interact
    with technology.
