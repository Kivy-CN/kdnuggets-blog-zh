    listings ask for the experience? No need to worry at all! You are at the right
    place. Building your projects will demonstrate your skills and help you land your
    first job. I will guide you on choosing suitable projects as a data analyst beginner
    that will convince the managers that you are the right person for the job. Selecting
    the projects randomly may polish your skills but remember that it's a competitive
    market and you have to stand out from the crowd. Your portfolio projects must
    showcase your ability to collect, clean, analyze, and present your data in a visually
    appealing manner.
