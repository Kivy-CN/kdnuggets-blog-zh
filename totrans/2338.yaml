    science buffs who want to collaborate with like-minded users. There''s a lot to
    do on the platform: aside from collaboration, users can search for and post their
    datasets, make use of GPU-integrated laptops and, perhaps most excitingly, enter
    into competitions between other users to tackle data science and ML challenges.'

- en: These [Kaggle competitions](/2022/05/packt-top-4-tricks-competing-kaggle-start.html)
    are a big reason why the platform is so popular today; the competitions encourage
    companies to disseminate an assortment of difficult-to-solve data science-based
    tasks whose prizes can be won by beginners and experts alike. In fact, pretty
    much anyone can take part in a Kaggle competition -- from students who want to
    dive deeper into AI to world-renowned data scientists who are experts in their
    field, Kaggle facilitates a unique blend of collaboration and places its users
    on a live leaderboard.

    and organizes solutions](https://farid.one/kaggle-solutions/) to Kaggle competitions.
    Let's quickly dive into Kaggle a bit further, explore an overview of this website,
    check out a few of the solutions it's gathered, and learn more about how you can
    get better at your own practice by learning how other data scientists have solved
    Kaggle problems.

- en: You can think of Kaggle as the AirBnB for AI and data science enthusiasts. The
    platform is crowd-sourced and designed to attract data scientists who want to
    hone their problem-solving skills by taking on ML, data science, and predictive
    analytics challenges. Its active members hail from more than 190 countries, and
    Kaggle gets nearly 150,000 monthly submissions from its users.
  prefs: []

- en: As we mentioned, Kaggle's big draw is its competitive scene. The platform posts
    challenges that can relate to anything from analyzing patient data to predicting
    cancer to performing sentiment analysis. The one thing all these challenges have
    in common is that competitors must apply data science to obtain solutions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Challenges posted on Kaggle are provided from different sources, and while some
    exist simply to give members a chance to nurture their skills, others are posted
    by businesses that have legit problems for which they need immediate solutions.
    Kaggle encourages as many users as possible to compete by [offering prize money](/2016/05/doing-data-science-kaggle-walkthrough-intro.html)
    to competition winners or those who solve a challenge and claim a top X position.
    Prizes may also come in the form of a company-provided product or job, as well.

- en: The Kaggle Solutions site is dedicated to gathering a list of nearly every available
    solution that top-performing competitors have devised during previous Kaggle competitions.
    The site is updated each time a new competition closes with a title and description
    of the competition, the important details (the prize type, the number of team
    members who took part in creating the solution, the type of competition and its
    metrics, as well as the year that the competition occurred).

    Rashidi](https://twitter.com/farid_rashidi). Rashidi currently serves as a National
    Cancer Institute fellow, where he conducts data science-driven research into vaccines
    for cancer. Rashidi previously attended Indiana university, where he received
    his doctorate in computer science and created computational tools that used single-cell
    sequencing data to work out tumor heterogeneity and evolution.

- en: This competition was published by American Express, which solicited default
    prediction solutions that would predict whether customers would default on their
    payments at some point in the future. The competition had an impressive prize
    of $100,000 and asked that competitors use ML to accurately predict customer credit
    defaults. American Express specifically asked that competitors use an industrial-scale
    set of data to create an ML model that challenged an existing production model.

    solo Kaggle competition winner. Daishu used a heavy ensemble with NN and LGB and
    released his solution's code [on Github](https://github.com/jxzly/Kaggle-American-Express-Default-Prediction-1st-solution).

    Ubiquant Investment Co., Ltd, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund. Ubiquant asked
    that competitors create a model to forecast the return rate of financial investment
    and train and test their algorithms against previous real-world prices.

    forecast investment returns in the future. The first-place solution [is posted
    on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ubiquant-market-prediction/discussion/338220)

    members to improve a fictional company's main product. 'Playground Series' competitions
    encourage members of all skill levels to model a tabular dataset. Kaggle notes
    that these competitions are mainly suited for members who want an intermediate-level
    challenge. The top-placing solution was posted on Kaggle by a user named 'Sawaimilert.’

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can initially be pretty daunting to take part in a Kaggle competition; you
    may feel like your chances of winning are pretty slim, and it may not be obvious
    whether you'll actually learn anything valuable that can nurture your skills.
    Plus, the top-placing performers typically leverage ensemble methods that are
    pretty complicated in response to datasets that are artificial and, ostensibly,
    unrealistic.

- en: With that said, even if you have some misgivings when it comes to competing,
    participating in at least a few Kaggle competitions [can be worthwhile](/2018/05/to-kaggle-or-not.html)
    -- there's something to be said about holding an opinion on something data-science
    related that you've tried versus having an opinion about something you've never
    taken part in.
  prefs: []

- en: You may, for example, discover a competition that focuses on a new and evolving
    topic that you're interested in and hasn’t taken part in in a data science-related
    context. New and [evolving topics like blockchain](https://cryptowallet.com/glossary/blockchain/),
    for instance, may be the focal point of future competitions. This is particularly
    likely considering the fact that Kaggle as a platform is rapidly evolving thanks
    to its acquisition by Google. It may be worth your time to periodically check
    in on new competitions that pique your interest.

    and ideas that have been developed by top-performing Kaggle competitors on Kaggle
    solutions. If you'd like to get your feet wet in data science's competitive space,
    you can also consider participating in other non-Kaggle-related competitions before
    diving into Kaggle itself.
