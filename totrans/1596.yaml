    high-level programming language is developed for general-purpose programming.
    Python interpreters are available on several operating systems, including Linux,
    MacOS, and Windows.

- en: With a running course of almost 3 decades, Python has garnered enormous popularity
    among the programming community. Using IDLE or the Python Shell for writing down
    Python code is effectual for smaller projects, but not practical while working
    on full-fledged machine learning or data science projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In such a case, you need to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
    or a dedicated code editor. As Python is one of the leading programming languages,
    there is a multitude of IDEs available. So the question is, “Which is the best
    IDE for Python?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apparently, there is no single IDE or code editor for Python that can be crowned
    with “THE BEST” label. This is because each of them has their own strengths and
    weaknesses. Furthermore, choosing among the vast number of IDEs might be time-consuming.

    of programming languages, including Java, PHP, and Python. The text editor supports
    plugins written in Node.js. Although Atom is available for a number of programming
    language, it shows an exceptional love for Python with its interesting data science
    features.
  prefs: []

    queries. However, you need to install the Data Atom plugin first to access the
    feature. It provides support for Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
    Furthermore, you can visualize results in Atom without the need of opening any
    other window.

    Preview Plus. This provides support for editing as well as visualizing Markdown
    files, allowing you to preview, render LaTeX equations, etc.

    server-client structure. It allows you to create as well as manipulate notebook
    documents called notebooks. For Python data scientists, Jupyter Notebook is a
    must-have as it offers one of the most intuitive and interactive data science
    environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to operating as an IDE, Jupyter Notebook also works as an education
    or presentation tool. Moreover, it is a perfect tool for those just starting out
    with data science. You can easily see and edit the code with Jupyter Notebook,
    allowing you to create impressive presentations.

    the graphs in the same document as the code is in. Also, you can export your entire
    work to a PDF, HTML or .py file. Like IPython, Project Jupyter is an umbrella
    term for a bunch of projects, including Notebook itself, a Console, and a Qt console.

    to Java. The full-featured Integrated Development Environment is available both
    in free and paid versions, dubbed Community and Professional editions, respectively.
    It is one of the quickest IDEs to install with a simplistic set up thereafter,
    and is preferred by data scientists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those with a likeness for IPython or Anaconda distribution, know that PyCharm
    easily integrates tools like Matplotlib and NumPy. This means you can work easily
    with array viewers and interactive plots while working on data science projects.
    Other than that, the IDE extends support for JavaScript, Angular JS, etc. This
    makes it opportune for web development too.

- en: Once you finish the installation, PyCharm can be readily used for editing, running,
    writing, and debugging the Python code. To start with a new Python project, you
    need to simply open a fresh file and start writing down the code. In addition
    to offering direct debugging and running features, PyCharm also offers support
    for source control and full-sized projects.

    especially for carrying out data analysis. If you have some experience with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/),
    then you will know that Rodeo shares many of its traits with it. For those of
    you unaware of RStudio, it is the most popular integrated development environment
    for the R language.
  prefs: []

    console, environment for variable visualization, and plot/libraries/files. Amazingly,
    both Rodeo and RStudio shares a great degree of resemblance with [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    beginners and veterans. As the Python IDE allows you to see and explore while
    creating simultaneously, Rodeo is undoubtedly one of the best IDEs for those starting
    out with data science using Python. The IDE also boasts built-in tutorials and
    comes with helper material.

    IDE is that it is optimized for data science workflows. It comes bundled with
    the Anaconda package manager, which is the standard distribution of [Python programming
    language](https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-python). Spyder has all the necessary
    IDE features, including code completion and an integrated documentation browser.

    curve allowing you to learn it in a flash. The online help option allows you to
    look for specific information about libraries while side-by-side developing a
    project. Moreover, the Python-specific IDE shares resemblance with RStudio. Hence,
    it is opportune to go for when switching from R to Python.

    further testifies to the fact that the IDE is meant especially for data scientists.
    Other than the appreciable IPython/Jupyter integration, Spyder has a unique “variable
    explorer” feature at its disposal. It allows displaying data using a table-based
    layout.
