- en: R Programming is on the rise year on year in popularity and is among the top
    10 programming languages over the last few years. Data science as a discipline
    is becoming mainstream, driven largely by fast growing internet & software technology
    companies. Media, Banking and other traditional verticals are warming up to the
    power of data to improve efficiency and predict the next big thing. All said and
    done, there is also a complaint that there are not enough people around that understand
    both software and statistics. There aren’t enough R programmers.

    is true. Without much ado, I present you the ‘Who, Where and What of R-Programmers’.
    No data was tortured in arriving at the conclusions. But I confess that I could
    not put R to use, to come up with the insights. Excel did the trick.

- en: First, there are only about 50,000 R programmers in the world. Now the rumor
    that Google’s data scientists make more than a million a year seems like true.
    For those that are still recovering from the “What did I just read?” type of shock,
    Glassdoor has more digestible numbers. They say that a data scientist makes around
    $118,000 per year.

    There is the US and then there is the rest of the world. The US has over 25% of
    all R programmers. Coming at distant second position is India, with about 4000
    to 6000 R Programmers (US has twice this number or a bit more). Canada has over
    a 1000 R Programmers.

    which has about 5000 R programmers in all. All of Asia, Africa, Middle East, South
    America and Eastern Europe have less than 500 R Programmers each in some cases
    and low double digits in most cases. Yemen has one R programmer. He or She must
    be feeling very lonely.

    wins. That’s understandable, given that one needs to understand and appreciate
    the workings of an organization before trying to make sense of the data it puts
    out. 60% of R Programmers come with more than 6 years of work experience. In fact,
    at 30%, people with more than 10 years of experience are the biggest cohort of
    R Programmers, grouped by work experience.

    your average age as late 20’s, because 1 in 3 are over their 30’s. It’s not good
    or bad. It’s just that you should be aware about your startup entering a phase
    where there is going to be diversity in terms of life stage of employees. Also,
    1 in 3 R Programmers in the UK are of foreign origin. I am sure, US is no different.
