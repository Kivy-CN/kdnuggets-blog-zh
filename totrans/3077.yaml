- en: I have been in the space of artificial intelligence for a while and am aware
    that multiple classifications, distinctions, landscapes, and infographics exist
    to represent and track the different ways to think about AI. However, I am not
    a big fan of those categorization exercises, mainly because I tend to think that
    the effort of classifying dynamic data points into predetermined fixed boxes is
    often not worth the benefits of having such a “*clear*” framework (this is a generalization
    of course as sometimes they are extremely useful).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also believe this landscape is useful for people new to the space **to grasp
    at-a-glance the complexity and depth** of this topic, as well as for those more
    experienced to have a reference point and to create new conversations around specific
    technologies.

    on AI and follow emergent dynamics, a gateway of pre-existing knowledge on the
    topic that will allow you to scout around for additional information and eventually
    create new knowledge on AI. I call it the **AI Knowledge Map (AIKM)**.

    Problem Domains*. The **AI Paradigms** (X-axis) are the approaches used by AI
    researchers to solve specific AI-related problems (it includes up to date approaches).
    On the other side, the **AI Problem Domains** (Y-axis) are historically the type
    of problems AI can solve. In some sense, it also indicates the potential capabilities
    of an AI technology.

    by different colors above). Briefly, the **Symbolic **approach states that human
    intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation, the **Sub-symbolic** approach
    is one that no specific representations of knowledge is provided ex-ante, while
    the **Statistical **approach is based on mathematical tools to solve specific
    sub-problems.

    applications** and **general applications**. The words used are on purpose, yet
    may appear slightly misleading... bear with me a moment as I explain. For anyone
    getting started in AI, knowing the difference between **Weak/Narrow AI** (*ANI*),
    **Strong/General AI** (*AGI*), and **Artificial Super Intelligence** (*ASI*) is
    paramount. For the sake of clarity, ASI is simply a speculation up to date, General
    AI is the final goal and holy grail of researchers, while narrow AI is what we
    really have today, i.e., a set of technologies which are unable to cope with anything
    outside their scope (which is the main difference with AGI).

    point to the distinction to help add some confidence when you read other introductory
    AI material. However, at the same time, the difference here outlines technologies
    that*** can only solve a specific task*** (generally better than humans — **Narrow** applications)
    and others that*** solve multiple tasks******today or in the future ***and interact
    with the world (better than many humans — **General** applications).

    classes of AI technologies are represented. Note, I am intentionally not naming
    specific algorithms but rather clustering them into macro-groups. I am also not
    providing you with a value assessment of what works and what does not, but simply
    listing what researchers and data scientists can tap into.

- en: So how do you read and interpret the map? Let me give you two examples.. If
    you look at Natural Language Processing, this embeds a class of algorithms that
    use a combination of a knowledge-based approach, machine learning and probabilistic
    methods to solve problems in the domain of perception. At the same time though,
    if you look at the blank space at the intersection between Logic-based paradigm
    and Reasoning problems, you might wonder why there are not technologies there.
    What the map is conveying is not that a method does not categorically exist that
    can fill a space, but rather when people approach a reasoning problem they prefer
    to use Machine Learning, for instance.

    one is creating a layer for the type of challenges AI is facing (e.g., memory
    issues and catastrophic forgetting, transfer learning, learning from fewer data
    with things like zero and one-shot learning, etc.) and what technology can be
    used to overcome that specific issue. Second, is to apply lenses to look at the
    different technologies and not the problems they are solving but rather the ones
    they are creating (e.g., ethical issues, data-intensive problems, black-box and
    explainability problem, etc.).'
