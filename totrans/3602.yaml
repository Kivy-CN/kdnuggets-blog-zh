  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MLOps stands for machine learning operations. The term MLOps is derived from
    DevOps (Development Operations). It is used to streamline the machine learning
    process from development to deployment. The MLOps include training machine learning
    models, experiment tracking, model optimization, creating ML pipelines, saving
    and serving models, and monitoring and maintaining models in production.

    and you are constantly monitoring the logs, metrics, and performance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deploying machine learning models in production is complex and challenging.
    A typical machine learning life cycle consists of data ingestion, data augmentation,
    modeling, training, optimizing, tracking experiments, and explaining the results.
    It requires the collaboration of an entire data team, from data engineers to data
    scientists. MLOps makes these processes automated so that you can continuously
    monitor and improve the model in production.

- en: MLOps allows you to reduce model deployment time and deliver higher-quality
    ML models. It provides vast scalability and management of thousands of ML models.
    You can control, manage, and monitor the continuous integration, continuous delivery,
    and continuous deployment - [Databricks](https://databricks.com/glossary/mlops).
