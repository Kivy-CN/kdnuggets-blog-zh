    as “the new gold” and “the new oil.” Organizations around the world, regardless
    of the industry and size, are investing heavily in data infrastructure to get
    their hands on this commodity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike gold and oil, which are precious because they are rare, data is ubiquitous.
    So, it is not the data itself that is valuable--it is everywhere. The value lies
    in an organization’s ability to engage with it meaningfully and extract business
    [insights](https://thedatathinker.com/2019/05/10/the-data-thinker/) from it. 
    And, therein lies the gap.

    from the general act of asking questions. Organized and deliberate questions not
    only help examine the information in front of you, but also help reflect on your
    own thinking about that information (metacognition). This kind of reflective thinking
    helps trace the path taken from information to conclusion and exposes any assumptions
    made along the way.

    has assumptions; makes claims or creates meaning; has implications and consequences;
    focuses on some things and throws others into the background; uses some concepts
    or ideas and not others; is defined by purposes, issues, or problems; uses or
    explains some facts and not others; is relatively clear or unclear; is relatively
    deep or superficial; is relatively monological or multi-logical. Critical thinking

  prefs: []

- en: An even more effective application of Socratic questioning is in stimulating
    a guided discussion among the stakeholders of a data project. By examining data
    together and reasoning through it together, the group can impart more context
    to it and construct a stronger statistical narrative; all the while developing
    their data literacy skills. Since the goal of a Socratic seminar is to think better,
    who better to lead the discussion than a [Data thinker](https://thedatathinker.com/2019/05/10/the-data-thinker/).
