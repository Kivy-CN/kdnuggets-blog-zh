    height and breadth. 3D data is a variation of 2D data with the addition of a ‘depth’
    component. Lidar and Radar scans are two kinds of sensor data. A 4D representation,
    commonly known as a movie, is created when several subsequent 3D objects are layered
    along the time axis.'

    of the data to create segmentation masks. In the case of 2D segmentation, one
    of two methods is used: pixel-based or polygon-based colouring. Because pixels
    are the smallest atomic component in this model, each one is given to one of the
    annotation classes. This leads to a point-based segmentation in 3D, where each
    3D point is labelled. A segmentation mesh can be extracted from a single object
    if enough points are provided.'

    Class-based and instance-aware segmentation are the two most common types. The
    segmentation mask for a particular class in the first example encompasses all
    areas that indicate a member of the class. In the second scenario, a distinct
    segmentation mask is constructed for each unique item of the chosen class, allowing
    different instances to be distinguished ( like separating two different cars for
    example ).

    the instance-aware subtype should be used. Here are a few of the causes behind
    this.

    learning models, including classification, detection, and localization, picture
    creation, foreground/background separation, handwriting recognition, content alteration,
    and many others. As a result, it’s employed in a variety of industries, including
    autonomous driving, fashion, film creation and post-production, agriculture, and

- en: Segmentation masks are the most exact since they only cover the position of
    the real item. Bounding boxes, on the other hand, frequently incorporate or connect
    with neighbouring territories. This is caused to non-rigid things being within
    or on top of other non-rigid objects.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    still used in many procedures. Fortunately, the surrounding bounding box can always
    be estimated using a segmentation mask. That’s how you cover all of your bases!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Making semantic masks by hand is a time-consuming and difficult task. When confronted
    with irregular forms or locations where the boundary between items is not immediately
    discernible, the labeller must accurately follow the outlines of each object (see
    pictures below). Annotating a single frame without specialized tools is prone
    to mistakes, inconsistencies, and can take more than 30 minutes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wouldn’t it be great if we could just train a neural network to do semantic
    segmentation once and then have all of our annotations without having to do anything?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is a misalignment between our perceptions of quality and
    how accuracy is assessed. The contour of an item is used to generate a segmentation
    mask, and the quality is determined by the percentage of the region that was properly
    detected.

- en: '**3\. It takes a long time to fix mistakes**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mistakes may be expensive in each of the aforementioned ways. Correcting an
    imperfect segmentation mask necessitates the correction of N additional masks,
    where N is the number of neighbouring masks (we’ll return to this later). It takes
    as long to adjust the mask as it does to create it from start. As a result, human
    adjustment of a completely automated segmentation’s output is likewise not possible.
    The only method to prevent this issue is to use specialized annotation software
    and labellers who are adequately educated.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you may have seen, segmentation mask creation necessitates the use of specific
    annotators, equipment, and automation. This raises the price dramatically, frequently
    by several folds above the cost of annotating basic bounding boxes, and quickly
    depletes the budget.
