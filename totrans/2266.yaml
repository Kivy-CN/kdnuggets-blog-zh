  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    model. How?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can be used in order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while keeping
    its underlying structure. These methods often include changing the initial feature
    space into a new lower-dimensional space in which the changed features capture
    the majority of the variation in the data.

    space into a new orthogonal space defined by principal components. These components
    are linear combinations of the original features chosen to capture the highest
    level of variance in the data.

    number of principal components increases. This is a typical behavior observed
    in PCA because principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they
    explain.
  prefs: []

    principal component captures the second highest amount, and so on. As a result,
    the explained variance ratio decreases with each subsequent principal component.

    you determine how many principal components (features) to select to represent
    the percentage of your data. The x-axis represents the number of principal components,
    and the y-axis shows the cumulative explained variance. As you move along the
    x-axis, you can see how much of the total variance is retained when you include
    that many principal components.

    already captures more than 80% of the total variance, and around 8 principal components
