    scientists](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-most-in-demand-skills-for-data-scientists-4a4a8db896db).
    That article resonated with folks. It has over 11,000 claps on Medium, was translated
    into several languages, and was the most popular story on KD Nuggets for November
    2018.

    looked at demand for general skills such as statistics and communication. I also
    looked at demand for technologies such as Python and R. Software technologies
    change must faster than demand for general skills, so I include only technologies
    in this updated analysis.

    and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) to see which keywords appeared with
    “Data Scientist” in job listings in the United States. This time I decided to
    write the code to scrape the job listings instead of searching by hand. This endeavor
    proved fruitful for SimplyHired, Indeed, and Monster. I was able to use the [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [Beautiful
    Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) Python libraries.
    You can see the Jupyter notebook with the code for the scraping and analysis at [my

    might have stemmed from rate limiting. ???? Update: I’m back in now, but concerned

    last year to this year, anyway. This summer I noticed that LinkedIn started having
    huge fluctuations from week to week for some tech job search terms. I hypothesize
    that they might have been experimenting with their search results algorithm by
    using natural language processing to gauge intent. In contrast, relatively similar
    numbers of job listings for ‘Data Scientist’ appeared for the three other search
    sites over both years.
