- en: 6.0002 is the continuation of 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming
    in Python and is intended for students with little or no programming experience.
    It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can
    play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel
    justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them
    to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.

    pattern recognition. Topics include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative
    learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector
    machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel
    methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs; VC theory; large margins);
    reinforcement learning and adaptive control. The course will also discuss recent
    applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous
    navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing.'

    hours a week for 12 weeks to complete the material. The course is based on lessons
    recorded at the University of San Francisco for the [Masters of Science in Data
    Science program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science).
    We assume that you have at least one year of coding experience, and either remember
    what you learned in high school math, or are prepared to do some independent study
    to refresh your knowledge.

    in Analytics program, summer 2017 (for graduate students studying to become data
    scientists). The course is taught in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, using libraries
    such as Scikit-Learn and Numpy for most lessons, as well as Numba (a library that
    compiles Python to C for faster performance) and PyTorch (an alternative to Numpy
    for the GPU) in a few lessons.
