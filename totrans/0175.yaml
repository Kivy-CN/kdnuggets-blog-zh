- en: ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, and people are increasingly curious about
    how to use it to become more productive or improve their lives and work. Many
    debates have already occurred about whether ChatGPT is a valuable and reliable
    educational resource. The answer is not as straightforward as it might seem. Let’s
    take a closer look.

- en: ChatGPT provides fast answers to inputs, but they’re not necessarily trustworthy.
    For example, it can [give wholly or partially false information](/2023/04/chatgpt-works-model-behind-bot.html)
    that seems very believable. People in the artificial intelligence research world
    deem this problem “hallucinations.”

- en: Anyone who’s ever taught a class or been a student has almost certainly encountered
    people who confidently make grossly wrong statements, conveying them as absolute
    facts. ChatGPT does the same thing when it hallucinates, which is particularly
    problematic for anyone using the tool to learn or complete educational projects.

- en: What amazes people most about ChatGPT is how fast it can give replies. When
    a student is under pressure to write a paper and feels like they’ve hit a mental
    wall, it’s easy to see how they could feel tempted to do more than use ChatGPT
    as a resource and directly copy from it instead.

- en: This has made college and high school educators consider [redefining plagiarism
    to include](/2023/03/downsides-ai-advancement.html) forbidding the copying of
    artificial intelligence-provided material. Teachers that suspect plagiarism can’t
    determine how a student got the content that potentially allowed them to copy
    from ChatGPT.

    have also discovered that [the tool often generates fake citations](https://blogs.library.duke.edu/blog/2023/03/09/chatgpt-and-fake-citations/)
    when users ask for its resources.

- en: Many people bring up their favorite teachers when asked what motivated them
    to pursue specific careers. Getting inspiration from an early age is important,
    especially since there’s still a gender imbalance in several professions. Fortunately,
    that’s starting to improve. At the Russian School of Mathematics — which serves
    50,000 students across North America — [78% of teachers and 48%](https://www.mathschool.com/blog/parent-resources/when-it-comes-to-girls-and-stem-learning-environment-matters)
    of students are female.

- en: However, evidence suggests that even if people use ChatGPT for reasons unrelated
    to their careers or education, the tool could still parrot harmful stereotypes
    to them. One user asked ChatGPT to tell a story about a boy and a girl choosing
    their careers. The girl in the tale doubted she could “handle all the technicalities
    and numbers in the engineering program,” but the boy loved working with machines
    and gadgets.

    someone choose a career path or course. However, there’s already enough negative
    feedback in the world without a chatbot adding to it and expressing outdated gender
    generalizations.

    to the time before ChatGPT. Now, the challenge is to figure out how learners might
    use the tool as a supplemental aid rather than expecting it to give them all the
    right answers.
  prefs: []

- en: Students could use the tool as a brainstorming engine, asking questions such
    as “What are the top five cybersecurity risks for businesses?” and then begin
    outlining their papers based on ChatGPT’s response. That doesn’t encourage people
    to cheat, but it opens their minds about things to cover they may have initially
    overlooked.

    but effective way to keep skills sharp and reduce delays when people need to produce
    content but aren’t sure how to start.

    generic experiments. It can also assist educators with administrative tasks —
    such as writing letters to parents and creating syllabi — thereby giving them
    more time to devote to teaching.

    very concerning examples of how people could misuse or get led astray by the tool.
    Users must keep these realities in mind whether they’re teachers, educators or
    just interested in artificial intelligence.
