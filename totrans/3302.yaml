    approach, but we do hope to provide some guidance on which algorithms to try first
    depending on some clear factors.

- en: Supervised learning algorithms make predictions based on a set of examples.
    For example, historical sales can be used to estimate the future prices. With
    supervised learning, you have an input variable that consists of labeled training
    data and a desired output variable. You use an algorithm to analyze the training
    data to learn the function that maps the input to the output. This inferred function
    maps new, unknown examples by generalizing from the training data to anticipate
    results in unseen situations.

    supervised learning is also called classification. This is the case when assigning
    a label or indicator, either dog or cat to an image. When there are only two labels,
    this is called binary classification. When there are more than two categories,
    the problems are called multi-class classification.'

    based on the past and present data. It is most commonly used to analyze trends.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The challenge with supervised learning is that labeling data can be expensive
    and time consuming. If labels are limited, you can use unlabeled examples to enhance
    supervised learning. Because the machine is not fully supervised in this case,
    we say the machine is semi-supervised. With semi-supervised learning, you use
    unlabeled examples with a small amount of labeled data to improve the learning
    accuracy.

    unlabeled data. It is asked to discover the intrinsic patterns that underlies
    the data, such as a clustering structure, a low-dimensional manifold, or a sparse
    tree and graph.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Clustering:** Grouping a set of data examples so that examples in one group
    (or one cluster) are more similar (according to some criteria) than those in other
    groups. This is often used to segment the whole dataset into several groups. Analysis
    can be performed in each group to help users to find intrinsic patterns.'

    In many applications, the raw data have very high dimensional features and some
    features are redundant or irrelevant to the task. Reducing the dimensionality

    on the feedback from the environment.  Machines try different scenarios to discover
    which actions yield the greatest reward, rather than being told which actions
    to take. Trial-and-error and delayed reward distinguishes reinforcement learning
    from other techniques.

- en: When presented with a dataset, the first thing to consider is how to obtain
    results, no matter what those results might look like. Beginners tend to choose
    algorithms that are easy to implement and can obtain results quickly. This works
    fine, as long as it is just the first step in the process. Once you obtain some
    results and become familiar with the data, you may spend more time using more
    sophisticated algorithms to strengthen your understanding of the data, hence further
    improving the results.
  prefs: []

    the highest reported accuracy, as an algorithm usually requires careful tuning
    and extensive training to obtain its best achievable performance.
