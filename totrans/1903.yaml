- en: Wikipedia defines [Statistical power or sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power)
    of a binary hypothesis test is the probability that the test correctly rejects
    the null hypothesis (H0) when the alternative hypothesis (H1) is true.

- en: To put in another way, [Statistical power](http://effectsizefaq.com/2010/05/31/what-is-statistical-power/)
    is the likelihood that a study will detect an effect when the effect is present.
    The higher the statistical power, the less likely you are to make a Type II error
    (concluding there is no effect when, in fact, there is).

- en: In medical testing, false negatives may provide a falsely reassuring message
    to patients and physicians that disease is absent, when it is actually present.
    This sometimes leads to inappropriate or inadequate treatment of both the patient
    and their disease. So, it is desired to have too many false positive.

- en: For spam filtering, a false positive occurs when spam filtering or spam blocking
    techniques wrongly classify a legitimate email message as spam and, as a result,
    interferes with its delivery. While most anti-spam tactics can block or filter
    a high percentage of unwanted emails, doing so without creating significant false-positive
    results is a much more demanding task. So, we prefer too many false negatives
    over many false positives.

- en: Selection bias, in general, is a problematic situation in which error is introduced
    due to a non-random population sample. For example, if a given sample of 100 test
    cases was made up of a 60/20/15/5 split of 4 classes which actually occurred in
    relatively equal numbers in the population, then a given model may make the false
    assumption that probability could be the determining predictive factor. Avoiding
    non-random samples is the best way to deal with bias; however, when this is impractical,
    techniques such as [resampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)),
    [boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)), and weighting
    are strategies which can be introduced to help deal with the situation.
