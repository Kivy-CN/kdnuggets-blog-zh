- en: Statistics, though a central set of tools for data science, are often overlooked
    in favor of more solidly technical skills like programming. Even machine learning
    learning algorithms, with their reliance on mathematical concepts such as algebra
    and calculus -- not to mention statistics! -- are often treated at a higher level
    than is required to appreciate the underlying math, leading, perhaps, to "data
    scientists" who lack a fundamental understanding of one of the key aspects of
    their profession.

    absolute basics of statistics. However, if you are unable to fully understand
    the basic descriptive statistics terminology included herein, you are definitely
    lacking foundational knowledge that is needed to build a whole series of much
    more robust and useful professional concepts on top of.

    in easy to understand language. A comprehensive example follows, which includes
    a bit of Python code. Note that, as a basic introduction, mathematical representations
    and descriptions of the terms herein have been intentionally omitted.

- en: Descriptive statistics are a collection of statistical tools which are used
    to quantitatively describe or summarize a collection of data. Descriptive statistics
    aim to summarize, and as such can be distinguished from inferential statistics,
    which are more predictive in nature.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A population is a selected individual or group representing the full set of
    members of a certain group of interest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**3\. Sample**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A sample is a subset drawn from a larger population. If this drawing is accomplished
    in such a manner that each member of the population has an equitable chance of
    selection, the result is referred to as a **random sample**.

- en: '**4\. Parameter**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A parameter is a value which is generated from a population. If I had all the
    data of all humans on Earth and generated the mean age, this value would be a
    parameter.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A statistic is a value which is generated from a sample. If I calculated the
    mean age of a subset of humans on planet Earth (much more feasible), this value
    would be a statistic. Hence, the discipline of statistics.

- en: '**6\. Generalizability**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generalizability refers tot he ability to draw conclusions about the characteristics
    of the population as a whole based on the results of data collected from a sample.
    This is ability is not a given, and depends heavily on the nature of sample collection,
    sample size, and various other factors.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A distribution is the arrangement of data by the values of one variable in order,
    from low to high. This arrangement, and its characteristics such as shape and
    spread, provide information about the underlying sample.

- en: '**8\. Mean**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mean, along with median and mode, is one of the 3 major measures of central
    tendency, which collectively evaluate an important and basic aspect of a distribution.
    The simple arithmetic average of a distribution of variable values (or scores),
    the mean provides a single, concise numerical summary of a distribution. The mean
    is also likely the most common statistics encountered in general research. Population
    mean is denoted μ, while sample mean is denoted x̄.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**9\. Median**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The median is the score of a distribution residing at the 50th percentile, separating
    the top and bottom 50 percent of scores. The median is useful for both splitting
    a set of distribution scores in half and helping to identify the skew of a distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**10\. Mode**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mode is simply the score which appears most frequently in the distribution.
    Multimodal refers to a distribution with more than one mode; bimodal refers to
    a distribution with 2 modes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**11\. Skew**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When there are more scores toward one end of the distribution than the other,
    this results in skew. When the scores of a distribution are more clustered at
    the high end, the relatively fewer number of scores on the low end result in a
    tail, with the scenario being referred to as negative skew. Positive skew is when
    a distribution shows a tail at its high end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, in a negatively skewed distribution, we would expect the mean to
    be less than the median, while in a positively skewed distribution, we would expect
    the mean to be greater than the median.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**12\. Range**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most important measures of dispersion, the range is the difference
    between the maximum and minimum values of a distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**13\. Variance**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variance is the statistical average of the dispersion of scores in a distribution.
    Variance is not often used on its own, but can be a useful calculation on the
    way to a more descriptive statistical measurement, such as standard deviation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**14\. Standard Deviation**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard deviation of a distribution is the average deviation between individual
    distribution scores and the distribution's mean. Individually, the standard deviation
    provides a good measure of how spread out a disquisitions scores are. When considered
    alongside the mean, these 2 measures provides a good overview of the distribution
    of scores.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**15\. Interquartile Range (IQR)**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The IQR is the difference between the score delineating the 75th percentile
    and the 25th percentile, the third and first quartiles, respectively.
