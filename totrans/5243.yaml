- en: Initially developed by Facebook, [Presto](https://prestodb.io/) is an open source,
    distributed ANSI SQL query engine that delivers fast analytic queries against
    various data sources ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes. For data scientists,
    this is ideal for returning Big Data query results in seconds, accelerating the
    iterative nature of data science discoveries by powering dashboards, reporting
    and ad-hoc analysis.

- en: Presto was designed and built from scratch to be a fast SQL query engine. It
    follows the classic MPP SQL engine design in which query processing is parallelized
    over a cluster of machines. As a result, highly concurrent queries execute at
    interactive speeds. However, there is one notable departure from the textbook
    recipe for a parallel DBMS -- the separation of compute and storage. The architecture
    of Presto fully abstracts the data sources it can connect to. The Connector API
    allows building plugins for file systems and object stores, NoSQL stores, relational
    database systems as well as custom services. As long as data scientists can map
    their data into relational concepts such as tables, columns, and rows, it is possible
    to create a Presto connector.

- en: In fact, Presto is available with a large number of existing connectors including
    HDFS, S3, Cassandra, Accumulo, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and other data stores.
    What’s more, inside a single installation of Presto users can register multiple
    catalogs and run queries that access data from multiple connectors at once. Additionally,
    whereas many data science projects and production applications require performing
    ETL, with Presto you can simply query data where it lives.

- en: For example, imagine correlating customer data from RDBMS with recent events
    in Kafka and going back to Hadoop or S3 to see how they relate to past trends.
    This is indeed “SQL-on-Anything.”

- en: Unlike the plethora of SQL-on-Hadoop engines, Hadoop is not required by Presto
    for Big Data queries and analytics. It can be deployed virtually anywhere, whether
    on a public cloud, a set of virtual machines or a dedicated cluster on premises.
    If Hadoop is in the mix, data scientists can rest assured. Presto simply connects
    to a Hive Metastore allowing users to share the same data with Hive, Spark, and
    other Hadoop ecosystem tools.An additional benefit of not being dependent on Hadoop
    is a vendor-neutral approach, and native support for common file formats including
    Avro, ORC, Parquet, RCFile, Text, etc.

    and user adoption at [enterprises of all shapes and sizes](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/wiki/Presto-Users),
    from fast-growing Internet companies to the Fortune 500\. Beside Facebook, early
    adopters include Airbnb, Dropbox, Groupon, and Netflix, among others. The acceleration
    of the Presto roadmap and successful proof-of-concepts has also led to production
    deployments at Bloomberg, Comcast, FINRA, LinkedIn, and Lyft, as well as Slack,
    Twitter, Uber and Yahoo! Japan.

    featured talks from several leading Presto adopters [discussing their deployments](https://www.starburstdata.com/technical-blog/2018/3/12/starburst-strata)
    and showcasing interactive speeds, [excellent query concurrency](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ca/public/schedule/detail/63786)
    and exceptional scalability.

- en: Beyond fast ANSI SQL and access to a variety of data sources, what else does
    Presto offer to data scientists? Consider ease of use, simple deployment and access
    via [Superset](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/), [Redash](https://redash.io/),[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
    and numerous JDBC- and ODBC-enabled analyst tools. Presto also integrates well
    with the data science ecosystem given its bindings for popular programming languages
    including C, Go, Java, Python, R and Ruby on Rails.

- en: Moreover, Presto features a large number of [built-in analytical functions](https://docs.starburstdata.com/latest/functions.html)
    including lambda expressions and functions, window functions, regular expressions,
    and even geospatial functions -- heavily leveraged [publicly by Uber](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/query-the-planet-geospatial-big-data-analytics-at-uber).
    In addition to standard SQL data types, data scientists are also able to work
    with complex types such as maps, arrays, structs and JSON.

- en: If this has piqued your interest, I encourage you to download the free, open
    source Presto and share your story. For many data scientists, this can quickly
    become a game changer for fast queries of Big Data and interactive analytics.
