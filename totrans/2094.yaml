    pieces, but chances are you'll miss something crucial. This is similar to how
    traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) function, they're brilliant but sometimes
    lack specific, up-to-date information.

- en: The [Naive RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997) paradigm represents the earliest
    methodology, which gained prominence shortly after ChatGPT became widely adopted.
    This approach follows a traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval,
    and generation, often referred to as a "Retrieve-Read" framework.

- en: Implementing Agentic RAG using LangChain takes this a step further. Unlike the
    naive RAG approach, Agentic RAG introduces the concept of an 'agent' that can
    actively interact with the retrieval system to improve the quality of the generated
    output.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Agentic RAG (Agent-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an innovative approach
    to answering questions across multiple documents. Unlike traditional methods that
    rely solely on large language models, Agentic RAG utilizes intelligent agents
    that can plan, reason, and learn over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These agents are responsible for comparing documents, summarizing specific documents,
    and evaluating summaries. This provides a more flexible and dynamic framework
    for question answering, as the agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks.

- en: 'Using an agent-based implementation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    offers several benefits which include task specialization, parallel processing,
    scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance. This is explained in detail below:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Task specialization**: Agent-based RAG allows for task specialization among
    different agents. Each agent can focus on a specific aspect of the task, such
    as document retrieval, summarization, or question answering. This specialization
    enhances efficiency and accuracy by ensuring that each agent is well-suited to
    its designated role.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Parallel processing**: Agents in an agent-based RAG system can work in parallel,
    processing different aspects of the task simultaneously. This parallel processing
    capability leads to faster response times and improved overall performance, especially
    when dealing with large datasets or complex tasks.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Scalability**: The architectures of Agent-based RAG are inherently scalable.
    New agents can be added to the system as needed, allowing it to handle increasing
    workloads or accommodate additional functionalities without significant changes
    to the overall architecture. This scalability ensures that the system can grow
    and adapt to changing requirements over time.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Flexibility**: These systems offer flexibility in task allocation and resource
    management. Agents can be dynamically assigned to tasks based on workload, priority,
    or specific requirements, allowing for efficient resource utilization and adaptability
    to varying workloads or user demands.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fault tolerance**: Agent-based RAG architectures are inherently fault-tolerant.
    If one agent fails or becomes unavailable, other agents can continue to perform
    their tasks independently, reducing the risk of system downtime or data loss.
    This fault tolerance improves the reliability and robustness of the system, ensuring
    uninterrupted service even in the face of failures or disruptions.'
