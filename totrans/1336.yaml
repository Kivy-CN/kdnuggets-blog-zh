    I have been programming for the past 8 years, but only recently have developed
    a keen interest in Data Science. I want to share my experience to encourage you
    to take the plunge too!

- en: I started out dipping my toe in the ocean of this vast topic with a couple of
    the Kaggle mini-courses. I didn’t need to learn how to write in Python, but I
    needed to equip myself with the tools to do the programming that I wanted. First
    up was [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) —
    it seemed like a good place to start. As part of this course you contribute to
    an in course competition, but even after completing it, I didn’t feel prepared
    to do a public competition. Cue [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning),
    where I learned to use a new model and how to think deeper about a data problem.

    a go at doing something with a dataset because I wanted to see my progress and
    evaluate my success, but I also didn’t want to feel bad about not being able to
    achieve anything. Having guidance on what to aim for felt like a nice security
    blanket too.

    I wanted something a bit different, but using the skills that I had learned, which
    mainly centred around numerical data to predict an outcome. The [Titanic: Machine
    Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) looked like a good one,
    it was labelled “Getting Started”. I don’t win anything from doing well at it,
    which might be a turn off. But, you have to evaluate: why are you doing the competition?
    At this point in my Data Science journey, I was looking to improve my knowledge
    and apply what I had learned.'

    I made achieved a 0.0000 mark i.e. it predicted nothing correctly. My first reactions
    were demoralised and upset. I really thought that I was going to be able to achieve
    something. It turns out, my output was in float type and not integer. One small
    change and suddenly I have an approximately 70% success rate.'

    at the other notebooks that had been shared, I wanted to make an attempt on my
    own first. I still think this was a good approach, but looking at them after I
    had submitted a couple of solutions myself allowed me to learn about what I don’t
    already know including approaches to the data and new algorithms. I even shared [my
    notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutiturner/titanic-randomforestregressor) publicly
    in case it is of use for anyone else or I receive feedback/tips on it to improve.'

    stuck in, that I looked at the data given, made some quick observations and jumped
    into writing the code. Having looked at other solutions/tutorial notebooks, I’ve
    come to understand more of what to look for in the data and different ways to
    solve issues (and why!) The things I found weren’t too different to what I had
    done, but they were more in depth solutions; the next steps on from what I had
    done.'

    place to start with that. I have by no means perfected my solution for the Titanic
    competition, but I have learned a lot from the experience.

- en: I’d like to attempt another competition on Kaggle, but at a more measured pace.
    I’ll sit down with pen and paper first to decide how each column of data is relevant
    and the ways I can deal with the gaps in the data effectively and efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would like to expand my knowledge too, not only going into more depth with
    the approaches to numerical data and predictions, but also into text analysis
    and image recognition. This will open so many more doors for me, both in terms
    of exploring new things and being able to attempt more competitions.

    into it and want more practice, I’d really recommend giving the Kaggle competitions
    a go.
