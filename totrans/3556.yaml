    recent successes, such as 97.5% accuracy on face recognition, nearly perfect German
    traffic sign recognition, or even [Dogs vs Cats image recognition](/2014/02/deep-learning-wins-dogs-vs-cats-competition.html)
    with 98.9% accuracy. Many winning entries in recent Kaggle Data Science competitions
    have used Deep Learning.

- en: The term "deep learning" refers to the method of training multi-layered neural
    networks, and became popular after [papers](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527#.U4NC_ygvCls)
    by Geoffrey Hinton and his co-workers which showed a fast way to train such networks.

    for deep learning, called [![Filters learned by ConvNet](../Images/59c33c368a67a25d88956ce7a3c1e37a.png)ConvNet](https://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/),
    which was successfully used in late 80-s and early 90-s for automatic reading
    of amounts on bank checks.

    a leading Machine Learning and Deep Learning expert (and co-founder of Coursera)
    to head their new AI Lab in Silicon Valley, setting up an AI & Deep Learning race
    with Google (which hired Geoff Hinton) and Facebook (which hired Yann LeCun to
    head Facebook AI Lab).
