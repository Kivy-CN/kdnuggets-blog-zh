    a mandate to build a data-first innovation team. You hire a group of data scientists,
    and everyone is excited and start coming to you for some of that digital magic
    to Googlify their business. Your data scientists don’t have any infrastructure

    workflow. This inefficiency is amplified in a corporate environment where data
    scientists need to coordinate every move with IT, continuous deployment is a mess
    (if not impossible), reusability is low, and the pain snowballs as different corners
    of the company start to “Googlify their business”.

    inconsistent API interface design, inconsistent auth and logging, and draining

    steps, expose models through a consistent API and auth, and reduce the operational
    burden on devops.

    increase as the space matures and model zoos grow. Despite it’s popularity, TensorFlow
    has not always been backward-compatible, Caffe can require special compilation
    flags, and cuDNN is literally another layer of complexity to manage over your
    GPU clusters. Fully containerizing and productionizing heterogenous models (in
    terms of code, node weights, framework, and underlying drivers) and running them
    over GPU architecture is a strong differentiator to a platform if not a mandatory
    requirement.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Versioning is the ability to list the lineage of a model over time and access
    each version independently. When models are versioned, data scientists can measure
    model drift over time. A single-version architecture exposes a single REST API
    endpoint for that model (the current *stable* version) and only the author is
    able to “switch” between models from their control panel. A multi-version architecture
    exposes a REST API endpoint for the *stable*version in addition to each previous
    version, making them all simultaneously available, which eliminates backward compatibility
    challenges and enables backend engineers to implement partial rollouts or real-time
    A/B testing.

    your model on a larger machine. Horizontal scaling is deploying your model on
    multiple machines. Serverless scaling, as implemented by [Algorithmia Enterprise](http://algorithmia.com/enterprise),
    is horizontal scaling on-demand by encapsulating your model in a dedicated container,
    deploying that container just-in-time across your compute cluster, and destroying
    it right after execution to release resources. Serverless computing brings scaling

    hardware resources. Single tenant platforms will run all production models within
    the same resources (machine instance, virtual memory, etc). Multi-tenant platforms
    deploy models as virtually siloed systems (via the use of containers or VMs per
    model) and might provide additional security measures such as firewall rules and
    audit trails.

    backend engineer is concurrently running production data on the same model from
    HDFS. A fixed data-source platform will require the author of the model to have
    implemented two data connectors: HDFS, S3\. A interchangeable data-source platform
    will require the author to implement a universal data connector, which serves
    as an adopter for multiple data sources, and a way to future-proof models to be
    compatible with whatever data source will come next. In Algorithmia Enterprise
    this is called the [Data API](http://docs.algorithmia.com/#data-api-specification).'
