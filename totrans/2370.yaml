- en: machine learning is a field of learning patterns through data without any need
    for explicitly programming or hand-written rules. It’s a subfield of artificial
    intelligence (AI) and computer science.

- en: Before machine learning became mainstream, programmers wrote rules derived from
    a function of their domain knowledge, observation of some hand-picked instances,
    and the business requirement to perform a particular task. But this legacy way
    of delivering business results suffered some evident constraints.

    can cover. This concept is very well explained by one of the most highly cited
    papers in the world of psychology titled [“The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
    Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)'

    proliferation of technology in our day-to-day lives. The varying data patterns
    fed to static pre-written rules are of little help to the business in taking meaningful
    actions. That is where the pattern mining ability of machine learning algorithms
    is put to the best use.

    rules that if the transaction amount is above $10K, transaction location is X,
    and it is made from a particular type, i.e., wire transfer, then it is flagged
    as a potentially fraudulent transaction.

- en: This could work like a charm for some time until the bad actors find an intelligent
    way to commit fraud. The conventional hard-coded rules are no more effective in
    detecting fraud. As their way of operation evolves, our fraud detection system
    needs to become too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Further, all the software development processes are highly collaborative?—?what
    if the developer who wrote the initial rules is no longer associated with the
    fraud detection project? And the new developer tasked with upgrading the logic
    has no understanding of the previous system and is skeptical about whether the
    recent changes will have backward compatibility. To summarize, updating a rule-based
    system is not only a cumbersome process but unscalable too.

    are well-defined and well-aligned with the business objective, it continues to
    learn from the new training data and evolves into a sophisticated machine learning
    system.

    implementing them to find the suitable model by hit and trial. But time is of

    tries to capture the real-world phenomenon by boxing it under some assumptions.
    These assumptions help simplify the modeling environment and focus only on relevant
    details. Hence, a model that is a good fit for one problem might not work well
    for another.
