    we have come across another worthy entrant in the series, and wanted to share
    it in time for the holiday learning season (which is most definitely a thing).

    Methods](https://acems.org.au/data-science-machine-learning-book-available-download)**,
    by D.P. Kroese, Z.I. Botev, T. Taimre & R. Vaisman. The book was published last
    year, and aside from being freely-available as a PDF can also be purchased in
    print form (and Kindle).'

- en: 'Data Science and Machine Learning: Mathematical and Statistical Methods is
    a practically-oriented text, with a focus on doing data science and implementing
    machine learning models using Python. It does a good job of explaining relevant
    theory and introducing the necessary math as needed, which results in very nice
    pacing for a practical book.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of this book is to provide an accessible, yet comprehensive textbook
    intended for students interested in gaining a better understanding of the mathematics
    and statistics that underpin the rich variety of ideas and machine learning algorithms
    in data science.

    strength as teaching the practical and reinforcing it with the necessary theory
    and underlying math, the argument can clearly be made that it focuses on the theory
    and underlying math and reinforces this with practical implementation.'

- en: Lots of relevant topics are covered here, and in logical succession. I particularly
    like the transition from Monte Carlo methods to unsupervised learning, and how
    that happens prior to the introduction of supervised concepts. Classification,
    though likely more useful in the long run (at least seemingly so at present) seemed
    far less impactful than did clustering when I first encountered machine learning,
    and so in my view its introduction prior may prove equally captivating for other
    new learners.

    that''s not its goal. By working through Data Science and Machine Learning: Mathematical
    and Statistical Methods you will get a solid foundation in the basics of the field,
    upon which more cutting edge methods and algorithms can be added.'

    learning the subject matter was [Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools
    and Techniques](https://www.elsevier.com/books/data-mining-practical-machine-learning-tools-and-techniques/witten/978-0-12-374856-0),
    also known as the Weka book. I really liked as a newcomer how it mixed practical
    and theoretical, introducing and explaining the math as needed in order to learn
    the practical implementation being presented at the time. I find that this book
    is reminiscent of that format, with the advantage of using Python instead of the
    Weka toolkit which, at least today, is a much more relevant implementation pathway.'

    learning, and looking to do so in the presentation format described.
