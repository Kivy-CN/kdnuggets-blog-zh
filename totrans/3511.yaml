- en: Google Prediction API lets developers tap into Google’s machine learning algorithms
    to crunch data and give possible results to make applications smarter. Google
    Prediction API is a cloud-based machine learning and pattern matching tool for
    the upsell of opportunity analysis, customer sentiment analysis, churn analysis,
    spam detection, document classification, purchase prediction, recommendations,
    intelligent routing and more.

- en: Google Prediction API uses classifiers for programming the API service to make
    predictions, thus it is enough if the users have some basic programming background
    without the working knowledge of AI. It reads data from BigQuery and Google Cloud
    Storage.

- en: Ford uses Google’s Prediction API in its research laboratories to increase the
    efficiency of driving. It tracks the driver to create a list of places and the
    routes that the driver visits on daily basis. This helps Ford detect intelligently
    that if a person is driving a car on particular time during the weekday then probably
    it will be a trip to the office. Ford uses Google Prediction API to predict the
    driver’s behaviour on the sensor data captured from their cars.

- en: Amazon Machine Learning API simplifies the process of making predictions that
    require lots of expertise around model building, data cleansing and statistical
    analysis.Amazon Machine Learning model deals with only prediction problems and
    functions by streaming the data past the model and adapting it slowly, depending
    on the prediction error.Amazon Machine Learning API also provides visualizations
    based on the prediction performance of the learned model so that the user can
    gain better insights.

- en: BigML is user-friendly and developer-friendly Machine learning API that mainly
    concentrates on decision trees. The motive of BigML is to make predictive analytics
    easy, understandable and beautiful to the users. It focuses on understanding the
    business processes and end-user analyst making reports. BigML API provides 3 important
    modes – Command Line Interface, Web Interface and a RESTful API. The web interface
    of BigML is pretty cool with features like one-click and gallery.

- en: BigML helps create a descriptive model to understand the relationships between
    the various attributes in the complex data and the predicted attributes so that
    business analysts can play with the what-if scenarios.

- en: BigML is useful if the analyst wants to create a predictive model based on past
    examples. Analysts can build the predictive model using BigML to make prediction
    in batch which can be downloaded as a CSV file for analysis.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BigML also finds great applications when periodic predictions are to be made.
    The model can be maintained on the BigML platform and then can be used remotely
    as and when required using the BigMLer command line interface.

    Machine Learning API- whoever learns fastest is the one who wins. Machine learning
    algorithms may not be perfect. This should not be a concern as the ultimate decision
    still rests with the humans. However, these machine learning algorithms cut down
    the vast number of choicesto something that human beings can manage. In future,
    machine learning will lead to novel innovations that will intensify human capabilities,
    assist people in making good choices and help navigate through the world in powerful
    ways.
