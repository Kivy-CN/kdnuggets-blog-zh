- en: Like many of you, I tend to write a lot of Python scripts which are meant to
    perform similar tasks, or at least follow a similar pattern of functionality.
    In an effort to not repeat myself (or, approached from a different angle, to always
    repeat myself in exactly the same way), I like to setup boilerplate or template
    code for these kinds of scripts in an effort to keep my programming life as lazy
    as possible.

- en: I recently wrote about [Managing Your Reusable Python Code as a Data Scientist](/2021/06/managing-reusable-python-code-data-scientist.html),
    and in that same vein I have put together a generic Python data processing script
    template I start off most projects with these days. It has changed and been tweaked
    over time, but this current version is the go-to for most, non-specialized (i.e.
    not machine learning) scripts that I start out writing.

    library modules; the next few lines import third party libraries, in the order
    'import', 'import ... as ...', and 'from ... import ...'; a custom module named
    const is imported, which I include in my projects as a separate Python file holding
    immutable project-specific variable assignments (constants); finally, any of my
    own custom Python modules are imported, in this case a 'dates' modules from my
    own preprocessing library.

    the argparse default messaging. The second function would obviously be repurposed
    for something specific, if needed.

    Here is the code for setting up BeautifulSoup, removing some HTML tags, using
    some variables stored in the const module for simple string replacements, as well
    as some use of regular expressions. These are all example stand-in excerpts to
    be changed without having to consult documentation.
