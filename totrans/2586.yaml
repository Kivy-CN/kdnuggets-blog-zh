    seen how competitive they can be. Each one can draw thousands or even tens of
    thousands of competitors, including academic and corporate teams.

    top 5 competitor on the Zindi platform–to painstakingly go through the winning
    solution for every competition that took place in 2020 and figure out what made
    them win. What frameworks did they use? How much experience did they have? What
    type of modelling did they use? Did they use deep learning? How big was their
    team? In this article, I’ll highlight some of the findings that might help you
    increase your chances of winning a competition.

- en: The first, and probably the most important thing to decide, is which competition
    to enter in the first place! Clearly, you’ll have a better chance of winning if
    you focus your efforts on one great entry for one competition at a time, rather
    than having mediocre entries for several competitions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing that likely increases your chances of winning is to have less competition.
    It’s clear from our data that the number of teams entering varies a lot across
    different competitions and platforms! HackerEarth, DrivenData, Unearthed, Kaggle,
    and CodaLab competitions have more than a thousand competitors on average.

- en: On the other end of the spectrum, we have one-off competitions like [Waymo’s
    Open Dataset Challenges](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/) or [IARAI’s Traffic4Cast
    Challenge](https://www.iarai.ac.at/traffic4cast/), which had only a few dozen
    competitors. While these can be more domain-specific and don’t have the convenience
    of Kaggle Kernels and Notebooks, if you have relevant expertise in that area,
    it probably makes sense to go for one of these competitions instead. On that note,
    this year, Waymo is once again running its [Open Dataset Challenges](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/)
    of four competitions with a $22k prize pool each! For other independent competitions,
    check [MLContests.com](http://mlcontests.com). If you see any that aren’t listed
    there, you can [submit a pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/mlcontests/mlcontests.github.io)
    to share it with the ML Contests community.

    Google’s [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and Facebook’s [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).'

- en: Probably due to its relative maturity and increased ease of deployment, TensorFlow
    has generally been the more popular framework in ‘production’ industry environments,
    as measured by job postings or GitHub stars.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In research, on the other hand, PyTorch has gone very quickly from irrelevance
    to the clear preference for most researchers. Its pythonic approach, relatively
    stable API, and ease of customisation have propelled it to being used in around
    80% of academic deep learning papers (only counting those where either TensorFlow
    or PyTorch are mentioned).

    have more experience or because you’re new to a particular area. Maybe you’re
    competent with Pandas and statistics but new to deep learning. Or maybe you’re
    a domain expert and understand ML concepts but aren’t much of a programmer.

- en: Well, you’re in luck! The first bit of good news is that, in our data set, over
    80% of winners had never won a competition before. So while there are certainly
    some breakthrough repeat winners, in general, they don’t dominate competitions,
    and newcomers as a group have a much better chance of winning.

- en: Taking deep learning as an example, around 15% of deep learning solutions used
    very high-level APIs such as Keras for TensorFlow, or fast.ai for PyTorch. As
    long as you’re comfortable with general machine learning and careful not to overfit,
    it turns out that these APIs can be enough to win. You don’t necessarily need
    to write your own models and training loops from scratch, and using the higher-level
    APIs can allow you to focus your efforts on gaining an edge elsewhere.

    Let’s consider the [Gawler Challenge](https://unearthed.solutions/u/competitions/exploresa)
    for predicting areas with mineral deposits in South Australia, with a $250k prize
    pool. We contacted the winning team to find out how they managed to bag the $100k
    top prize. It turns out that they are expert geologists who mainly relied on their
    knowledge in the field to get their edge. They combined geomechanical modelling
    with random forests. The interesting part is that they used [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/),
    a GUI tool for the random forests implementation. This allowed them to focus on
    the area where they could excel, and it clearly paid off.
