- en: From small to large businesses, just about every company is fighting for a chance
    to get their audience's attention. Regular marketing campaigns performed 20 years
    ago just don't cut it anymore. To get ahead of the curve and beat out your competitors,
    you often have to market directly to the source, especially if you cater to the
    millennial generation.

    To market directly to your potential buyer, you need to know what they're interested
    in, what they need, where they are and where they're most likely to respond to
    your advertisements.

- en: While data can't get overly detailed about an individual, it's really good about
    getting to know a group. Finding out how your target audience acts doesn't have
    to be difficult if you can utilize data effectively. One way to do so is through
    data mapping.

- en: Data mapping is a way to [organize various bits of data](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-data-mapping)
    into a manageable and easy-to-understand system. This system matches data fields
    with target fields while in storage.
  prefs: []

- en: Simply put, not all data goes by the same organizational standards. They may
    refer to a phone number in as many different ways as you can think of. Data mapping
    recognizes phone numbers for what they are and puts them all in the same field
    rather than having them drift around by other names.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this technique, we're able to take the organized data and put a bigger
    picture together. You can find out where most of your target audience lives, learn
    what sorts of things they have in common and even figure out a few controversies
    that you shouldn't touch on.

    called [unification and data cleaning](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-data-cleaning-and-unification-b3213bbd18e).
    These processes are often powered by machine learning, which is not to be confused
    with artificial intelligence.
  prefs: []

- en: Machine learning uses patterns and inference to offer predictions rather than
    perform a single task, which is more of a subset of AI technology than anything.
    In the earlier example, machine learning is used to recognize a phone number and
    assign it to its proper category for organizational purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning goes a step beyond just recognizing phone numbers though. The
    technology can recognize errors like missing values or typos and group information
    from the same source together.
  prefs: []

- en: That's what data cleaning and unification really means — to clean up all of
    the data without any human input and present the information in its most perfect
    and precise form. This process saves time and is also more effective in regard
    to how correct the information will be.
  prefs: []

- en: The data can then be displayed in almost any way a person or company needs to
    see it. For instance, geospatial data is one route machine learning can automatically
    take and create without input. Geospatial data is basically [translating data
    into a map](https://www.mapbusinessonline.com/Whitepaper.aspx/How-Businesses-Use-Geo-Spatial-Data)
    and plotting out physical locations and routes that your target audience takes
    every day. This technique can provide a unique aid to your next advertising campaign.

- en: Machine learning allows data mapping to be more precise. Without that technology,
    data mapping would be either very rudimentary or have to be done completely manually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assuming we go the rudimentary route, a simple spreadsheet would be able to
    take information and plug into its best guess of a proper category. Typos wouldn't
    be fixed, missing values would remain missing and some information would just
    be scattered in random places.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Trying to complete data mapping manually would be worse. For one, a person would
    never be able to keep up with the flow of information, not to mention the backlog
    of information already hiding and in need of sorting in the Internet of Things.
    Assuming someone could keep up with the flow, there would still be errors as the
    sheer amount of data would lead to the human being unable to notice connections
    like a machine could.

    the best possible place and time to reach customers will allow you to target your
    audience more efficiently.

    outlets use data mapping to save money and appear more loyal to their customer
    base.

    for your customers' attention. The competition is dense these days, so getting
    ahead of the curve and staying ahead is an art everyone is trying to perfect.
    Data mapping can help you get there as early as possible.
