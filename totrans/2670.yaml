    and non-profit organizations. There are a wide variety of ways people are applying
    machine learning for social good.

    learning to identify children at risk for maltreatment. In the U.S., between 1,500
    and 3,000 infants and children die due to abuse and neglect each year. Children
    aged 0-3 years are at the greatest risk. Those most vulnerable are commonly not
    visible to the professionals. Models improve early detection and intervention,
    and this organization conducts strategic planning to optimize the spatial allocation
    of prevention resources.'

    flag unwanted outcomes -- such as defaults, cancelations, and fraud -- and respond
    accordingly to intervene, the same concept applies to altruistically intervene
    when bad things may happen to individuals. It''s another way models serve to basically
    triage limited resources. A company only has so many resources to retain at-risk
    customers, just as child welfare organizations have limited resources to protect
    at-risk children. Prioritizing and targeting resources increases the power of
    a fixed amount of resources. It’s the same business value proposition, now applied
    for social good.'

    incidents. This serves as an early warning system to proactively flag, as an improvement
    over the more common reactive steps taken after a positive test for poisoning.
    The risk scores serve to target homes for inspection and children for testing
    and could help people determine safer homes to move to.

    prevalent -- after all, most any non-profit or charitable organization fundraises.
    And universities commonly target their fundraising as well.

    that "order fulfillment" isn't actually necessary -- you don't need to fulfill
    any purchase. But in both cases, you calculate the net returns in the same way,
    based on the cost of the campaign and the income it generates.

- en: Predictively targeting beneficiaries is a growing practice. In this case, the
    model targets whom to give money to, rather than whom to ask for money from! For
    example, some charitable organizations determine which development project to
    greenlight by predicting project success. This way, the organization executes
    its mission more effectively.

    target its outreach to the most responsive and eligible applicants. In another
    case, I conducted a five-day training program for the Inter-American Development
    Bank -- the largest source of development financing for Latin America and the
    Caribbean -- as they investigated modeling project outcome success.

    for traditional bank loans -- develop their own specialized risk models in order
    to accommodate debtors often flagged as too-high-risk by traditional financial
    institutions. By decreasing the financial risk of their loans to the unbanked
    or impoverished, organizations like Mimoni and Kiva are able to fulfill their
    mission.

    applies machine learning, I strongly encourage you to get involved with these
    kinds of social good applications. Ethical examinations of machine learning often
    ask whether certain applications do more harm than good -- but if you’re applying
    it specifically for social good, the answer is clear, and the community will wholeheartedly
    embrace you.
