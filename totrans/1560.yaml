    good project which required him to hire 2 Data Scientist. He had put a job posting
    on LinkedIn and to his surprise he received close to 200 resumes. When I met him
    in person he remarked, “*if only there was a way to select the best resumes out
    of this lot in a faster manner than manually going through all resume one by one*”.

    past 2 years. I decided to take a shot at my friend’s problem. I told my friend
    perhaps we can solve this problem or at least bring down the time of manual scanning
    through some NLP techniques.

    whether a person has expertise in Machine learning or Data engineering because
    we are not keeping a count of the phrases while reading. The code on the other
    hand just hunts for the keywords ,keeps a tab on the occurrence and the categorizes
    them.

    screening of candidates. It is hence advisable to tailor make your resume for
    the particular job requirement with the required keywords.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A typical Data Scientist has two options either position himself/herself as
    a generalist or come across as an expert in one area say ‘NLP’. Based on the job
    requirement, a Data Scientist can run this code against his/her resume and get
    to know which keywords are appearing more and whether he/she looks like a ‘Generalist’
    or ‘Expert’. Based on the output you can further tweak your resume to position
    yourself accordingly.
