    chain pipeline to satisfy customers by providing value. This can be achieved through
    data science by making data-driven judgments and decisions. According to this
    [post](https://supplychaindigital.com/supply-chain-2/supply-chain-inefficiencies-costing-uk-businesses-more-pound15bn),
    employees spend over 100 million hours per year on phone calls and emails to move
    data back and forth between their trade partners, costing nearly $2B to UK companies.
    This vast amount of wasted hours can be reduced by automating communication using
    technology. Here are some of the data science technologies needed to build a comprehensive
    and smooth supply chain pipeline.

    unstructured, or semi-structured, which is either machine or human-generated.
    But where does this data come from? It could be sensor data generated from weather
    stations, ships, and containers.

    process, store and analyze the data. For example, Amazon Simple Storage Service
    (Amazon S3) can store data that is scalable, secured, and efficient. After that,
    you can plug these data sources into other services such as Amazon QuickSight
    to create interactive Business Intelligence dashboards. There are other cloud
    providers and services which offer similar products. Companies can choose a service
    provider depending on the existing technology, which will help them with easier
    integrations.

    which can be translated into actions. By using machine learning and artificial
    intelligence, you can increase customer satisfaction by showing relevant products.
    On the other hand, you can use prediction algorithms to forecast customer demands.
    Also, the forecast data can help automate warehouse operations to increase the
    inventory turnover rate.

    visibility](https://www.logmore.com/post/supply-chain-visibility) by providing
    more control over their operations. Real-time decisions can be made when you tag
    items using IoT sensors. For example, a business can track and monitor ships and
    re-route them based on traffic to make a reliable and faster transit, which will
    help reduce shipping delays. Moreover, companies can avoid losing money by monitoring
    temperature data from refrigerated shipping containers in the case of technical
    malfunction.

    such as Customer relationship management (CRM). The benefits of cloud computing
    are endless. They can scale up depending on the traffic. Also, based on the Service
    Level Agreements (SLAs), the applications will have guaranteed uptime (high availability).
    Cloud platforms such as AWS makes their services reliable, secure, and cost-effective.

    that provides state-of-the-art features to build an enterprise-level application.
    Features like reusable components, virtual DOM, JSX makes React a great JavaScript
    library. React’s lazy feature can be used to load components dynamically to increase
    the app's performance. Serving a React is cheap since it is served from a CDN.
    Moreover, there are thousands of NPM modules available that can be used to build
    applications faster. It offers out-of-the-box libraries such as [compromise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compromise).
    It can be used to perform natural language processing. Also, a business can create
    cross-platform mobile applications using React native.

    can build micro front-ends with module federation instead of a monolithic application.
    It will provide complete freedom to design and build independently without breaking
    the whole application. For example, N number micro front-ends can serve services
    like tracking, analytics, authentication, reports, etc.

    to optimize and strengthen the pipeline that pretty much every human being relies
    on. These six technologies, once novel, are now a critical part of supply chain
    pipelines. Supply chain managers should look into these data science technologies
    and start integrating them sooner than later. It will help businesses to make
    an efficient and cost-effective supply chain pipeline and increase customer satisfaction.
