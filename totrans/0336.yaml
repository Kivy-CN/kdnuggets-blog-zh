- en: As a seasoned ML developer who has hired many junior engineers across different
    projects, I have come to realize that there are certain skills essential for a
    junior developer to be considered for a job in the field. These skills vary depending
    on the project and the company, but there are some fundamental skills that are
    universally required.

    have in order to be successful in their job search. By the end of this article,
    you will have a better understanding of what skills are necessary for junior ML
    developers to land their first job.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Junior developers looking to land their first job often come from other fields,
    having completed some ML courses. They have learned basic ML but do NOT have a
    deep background in engineering, computer science, or mathematics. While a math
    degree is not required to become a programmer, in ML, it is highly recommended.
    Machine learning and data science are fields that require experimentation and
    fine-tuning of the existing algorithms or even creating your own ones. And without
    some knowledge of math, it is hard to do.

- en: College students with a good degree are at an advantage here. However, while
    they might have a deeper technical knowledge than an average junior without a
    specialized education, they often lack the necessary practical skills and experience
    that are vital for a job. College education is wired to give the students fundamental
    knowledge, often paying little attention to marketable skills.

- en: Most applicants for junior ML engineer positions don’t have any problems with
    SQL, vector embeddings, and some basic time series analysis algorithms. I also
    used basic Python libraries such as Scikit-learn and applied basic problem-solving
    and algorithms (clustering, regression, random forests). But it’s not enough.

- en: As you now understand, most educational programs are unable to give hands-on
    experience and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. If you are determined
    to build a career in the field of ML, there are things you will need to learn
    on your own to make yourself more marketable. Because if you aren’t willing to
    learn, and I say that with care, don’t bother ? the days when anybody could land
    a career in IT are gone. Today it’s a pretty competitive market.

- en: One of the key skills that popular courses may not provide a deep enough understanding
    of is random forests, which includes pruning, how to select the number of trees/features
    etc. While courses may cover the basics of how random forests work and how to
    implement them, they may not delve into important details. Or even talk about
    some more advanced ensembling methods. These details are crucial for building
    effective models and optimizing performance.

- en: Another skill that is often overlooked is web scraping. Collecting data from
    the web is a common task in many ML projects, but it requires knowledge of tools
    and techniques for scraping data from websites. Popular courses may touch on this
    topic briefly, but they may not provide enough hands-on experience to truly master
    this skill.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to technical skills, junior ML developers also need to know how
    to present their solutions effectively. This includes creating user-friendly interfaces
    and deploying models to production environments. For example, Flask in conjunction
    with NGrok gives you a powerful tool for creating web interfaces for ML models,
    but many courses do not cover these at all.
  prefs: []

- en: Another important skill that is often overlooked is Docker. Docker is a containerization
    tool that allows developers to easily package and deploy applications. Understanding
    how to use Docker can be valuable for deploying ML models to production environments
    and scaling applications.

- en: Virtual environments are another important tool for managing dependencies and
    isolating projects. While many courses may cover virtual environments briefly,
    they may not provide enough hands-on experience for junior developers to truly
    understand their importance.

    development, including ML projects. However, many junior developers may only have
    a surface-level understanding of GitHub and may not know how to use it effectively
    for managing ML projects.

    keep track of model performance and experiment results. These systems can be valuable
    for optimizing models and improving performance, but they may not be covered in
    depth in many courses.

    competition and become valuable assets to any ML team.

    objects in images. There is no need to use the most sophisticated models, just
    use some models that can show your skills with basics of deep learning like U-net
    or YOLO. The project can include uploading an image to a website using ngrok or
    a similar tool, and then returning the image with objects detected and highlighted
    in squares.
