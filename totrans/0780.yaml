    two variables in the dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the `df_employees` dataframe, let's create a scatter plot to visualize the
    relationship between the age of the employee and the salary. This will help us
    understand if there is any correlation between the ages of the employees and their
    salaries.

    variable which is usually time or a similar scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When creating the `df_employees` dataframe, we had defined a linear relationship
    between the number of years an employee has worked with the company and their
    salary. So letâ€™s look at the line plot showing how the average salaries vary with
    the number of years.

    the number of years an employee has worked at the company, we see that the line
    plot reflects that.

    and for identifying outliers.

    departmentsâ€”giving a high-level comparison of salary distribution within the organization.

    over different age groups. To map the employees into bins based on age group,
    we use `pd.cut()`.
