    line tools which can be useful for data science tasks. The list does not include
    any general file management commands (`pwd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, ...) or remote
    session management tools (`rsh`, `ssh`, ...), but is instead made up of utilities
    which would be useful from a data science perspective, generally those related
    to varying degrees of data inspection and processing. They are all included within
    a typical Unix-like operating system as well.
