    it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and resources
    available. You may find yourself making the same mistakes that countless others
    have made before you. But why waste time and energy repeating those errors when
    you can learn from their experiences?

- en: As someone who has spoken with experienced practitioners in the field, I've
    always been curious to learn about their AI journey. I quickly discovered that
    many of them encountered similar challenges and pitfalls early on. That's why
    I'm writing this article—to share the 5 most common mistakes that novices in AI
    often make, so you can avoid them.

- en: As an AI beginner, it's easy to get excited about flashy algorithms and powerful
    frameworks. However, just like a tree needs strong roots to grow, your understanding
    of AI needs a solid foundation. Ignoring the math behind these building blocks
    can hold you back. Frameworks are there to help the computer perform calculations,
    but it's important to learn the underlying concepts instead of just relying on
    black-box libraries and frameworks. Many beginners start with tools like scikit-learn,
    and while they may get results, they often struggle to analyze performance or
    explain their findings. This usually happens because they skip the theory. To
    become a successful AI developer, it's essential to learn these core concepts.

    a simple, one-size-fits-all answer. It's a mix of several factors. However, for
    the purpose of this discussion on fundamentals, it's important to emphasize the
    significance of problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms. Most ML companies
    will assess these skills during the recruitment process, and mastering them will
    make you a stronger candidate.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You might have seen profiles on LinkedIn claiming expertise in AI, ML, DL,
    CV, NLP, and more. It''s like a long list of skills that can make your head spin.
    Maybe it''s because of social media or the trend of being a "Full Stack Developer"
    that people compare AI to. But let''s be real here, living in a fantasy world
    won''t help. AI is a very vast field. It''s unrealistic to know everything, and
    trying to do so can lead to frustration and burnout. Think of it this way: it''s
    like trying to eat an entire pizza in one bite – not exactly practical, is it?
    Instead, focus on becoming really good at one specific area. By narrowing your
    focus and dedicating your time to mastering one part of AI, you''ll be able to
    make a meaningful impact and stand out in the competitive AI world. So, let''s
    avoid spreading ourselves too thin, and let''s concentrate on becoming experts
    in one thing at a time.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think the biggest mistake beginners often make is getting overwhelmed by the
    countless online tutorials, courses, books, and articles available when learning
    AI. Learning and engaging in these courses is not a negative thing. However, my
    concern is that they may not find the right balance between theory and practice.
    Spending too much time on tutorials without actually applying what they've learned
    can lead to a frustrating situation known as "tutorial hell." To avoid this, it's
    important to put your knowledge to the test by working on real-world projects,
    trying out different datasets, and continuously working to improve your results.
    Additionally, you'll notice that some concepts taught in courses may not always
    work best for specific datasets or problems. For instance, I recently watched
    a session on [Aligning LLMs with Direct Preference Optimization by DeepLearning.ai](https://www.youtube.com/live/QXVCqtAZAn4?si=o1i3MistxdjLOI4Y),
    where research scientist [ED Beeching](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-beeching-3553b468/)
    from Huggingface mentioned that although the original Direct Preference Optimization
    paper used RMSProp as an optimizer, they found Adam to be more effective in their
    experiments. You can only learn these things by getting hands-on experience and
    diving into practical work.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When beginners want to showcase their AI skills, they often feel tempted to
    create numerous projects to demonstrate their expertise. However, it's crucial
    to prioritize quality over quantity. I've observed that people working in big
    tech companies often have 2-3 strong projects on their resumes, instead of 6-10
    small or mediocre ones that many others include. This approach is not only beneficial
    for job prospects but also for learning. You can get a better understanding of
    the subject matter. Instead of following YouTube tutorials or building a bunch
    of average projects, consider investing a month or so of your time and energy
    into projects that will have long-term value. This approach will steepen your
    learning curve and truly highlight your understanding. It can also make your resume
    stand out from everyone else. Even after securing a job, you won't struggle much
    when transitioning to the actual work.

- en: I understand that different people have different work preferences. Some may
    prefer working alone, while others seek support. For beginners in machine learning,
    it can be overwhelming, and working in isolation may hinder your growth. I highly
    recommend engaging with AI communities on platforms like Reddit, Discord, Slack,
    LinkedIn, and Facebook. If you're not comfortable with communities, consider finding
    an AI mentor for guidance and support. Discuss your projects with them, seek their
    advice, and learn about better approaches. This not only makes the learning process
    enjoyable but also saves time. Although I don't encourage you to immediately post
    questions or reach out to your mentor as soon as you encounter a problem, you
    should always try to solve it yourself first. But after a certain point, it's
    okay to seek help. This approach saves you from burnout, enhances your learning,
    and in the end, you'll feel good about yourself for trying and gaining knowledge
    about what didn't work.
