- en: '**Output**: The algorithm returns the final K clusters, where each data point
    belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The K-means algorithm seeks to minimize the within-cluster sum of squared distances,
    also known as the inertia or the total intra-cluster variance. It assumes that
    the clusters are spherical and have equal variance. However, the algorithm may
    converge to suboptimal solutions depending on the initialization of centroids.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To enhance the performance of K-means, various techniques can be applied, such
    as using multiple initializations, performing smarter centroid initialization
    methods (e.g., K-means++), or using the Elbow method to determine the optimal
    value of K.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's important to note that K-means is sensitive to the initial choice of centroids
    and may struggle with datasets containing non-linear or irregularly shaped clusters.
    In such cases, alterntive clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture
    Models (GMM) may be more suitable.
