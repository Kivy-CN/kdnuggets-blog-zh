- en: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in generative
    AI, have captured the public's imagination and demonstrated the potential of these
    technologies to drive a new era of economic and social opportunities. One such
    breakthrough is [Meta's Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), the next generation
    of their open-source large language model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meta's Llama 2 is trained on a mix of publicly available data, and designed
    to drive applications such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and other modern chatbots.
    Trained on a mix of publicly available data, Meta claims that Llama 2’s performance
    is improved significantly over previous Llama models. The model is available for
    fine-tuning on AWS, Azure, and Hugging Face’s AI model hosting platform in pretrained
    form, making it more accessible and easier to run. You can also [download the
    model here](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/).

    been fine-tuned for two-way conversations. Both versions come further subdivided
    into models of varying sophistication: 7 billion parameter, 13 billion parameter,
    and 70 billion parameter models. The models were trained on two trillion tokens,
    which is 40% morethen the first Llama model, including over 1 million human annotations.'

- en: Llama 2 has a context length of 4096, and employs reinforcement learning from
    human feedback specifically for safety and helpfulness in the case of Llama-Chat-2's
    training. Llama 2 outperforms other LLMs, including like Falcon and MPT, in the
    areas of reasoning, coding, proficiency, and knowledge tests, according to Meta.

    by making AI models available openly, they can benefit everyone. This development
    permits both the business and research worlds to access tools that would become
    prohibitive to build and scale themselves, which opens up myriad opportunities
    for research, experimentation and development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meta also emphasizes safety and transparency. Llama 2 has been "red-teamed,"
    and thus has been tested for safety by generating adversarial prompts for the
    purposes of fine-tuning the model, both internally and externally. Meta discloses
    how the models are evaluated and tweaked, promoting transparency in the development
    process.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Llama 2 does its best to continue Meta's perspective in the field of generative
    AI. Its improved performance, open-source nature, and commitment to safety and
    transparency make Llama 2 a promising model for a wide range of applications.
    As more developers and researchers gain access, we can expect to see a surge in
    innovative AI-powered solutions.

- en: As we move forward, it will remain crucial to continue addressing the challenges
    and biases inherent in AI models. However, Meta's commitment to safety and transparency
    sets a positive precedent for the industry. With the release of Llama 2, we now
    have another tool available in our generative AI arsenal, and one that makes open
    access an ongoing commitment.
