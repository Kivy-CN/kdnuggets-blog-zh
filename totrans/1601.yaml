    scientists. I looked at general data science skills and at specific languages
    and tools separately. I searched job listings on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [SimplyHired](https://www.simplyhired.com/), [Monster](https://www.monster.com/),
    and [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs) on October 10, 2018\. Here’s a chart showing
    how many data scientist jobs each website listed.

    for *“data scientist” “TensorFlow”* which is only going to be found with data
    scientist positions, but if your keywords are “*data scientist” “react.js”* it
    returns far too many listings for companies with non-data scientist job listings.
