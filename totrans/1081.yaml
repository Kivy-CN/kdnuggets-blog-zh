    able to provide us with solutions to our real-life problems. However, when it
    comes to Data Science, the theory that is being put into practice is not always
    the same as reality.

- en: As a Data Scientist, it is very normal to receive large amounts of data that
    have issues with it and require heavy data cleaning, model design, and model execution.
    The problems are purely due to the complexity and scope of the data that is being
    used to answer a question. Problems in the data can be the number of features,
    the errors, the characteristics, and more.

    correctly and efficiently.

    for them.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main component for a Data Scientist is Data; it’s part of their title. Without
    data, the movement of Data Science is limited, which would be a problem for a
    world that’s heavily dependent on data now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there is not enough data, it becomes a problem as it is an important element
    for training algorithms. If the data is limited, it can lead to inaccurate and
    inefficient outputs, costing the company a lot of time and resources. However,
    there are solutions to generating more data to train your model.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are aware of the values you are looking for, there is a possibility of
    randomly generating those values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A way to do this is by pseudo-random, which is generated with a pseudo-random
    number generator (PRNG). This is  an algorithm which generates seemingly random
    but still reproducible data. Reproducibility is the ability to obtain consistent
    results using the same data and code as the original study.

    which you can then imitate or replicate values based on the data distribution.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Augmentation is a strategy used to significantly increase the diversity
    of data available for training models, without having to collect new data. For
    example; techniques such as cropping, padding, and horizontal flipping are used
    heavily to train large neural networks.
  prefs: []

    be solved, to make sure you are generating valid inputs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When working with smaller datasets, the likelihood of overfitting increases
    automatically. To remind you: Overfitting is a modeling error that occurs when
    a function is too closely aligned to a limited set of data points.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    regularisation, or cross-validation.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a problem with not having enough data, but there is also a problem
    with having too much data. Having more data does not guarantee that your model
    will produce accurate outputs.
  prefs: []

- en: Factors such as computational power, time taken and the overall output. You
    may realise that using less data allows your model to perform more efficiently
    and faster. There are things you can take into consideration when working with
    a lot of data.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In Layman’s terms, p-value is the probability that the results from your sample
    data occurred by chance, therefore a low p-value is good. Anything < 0.5% is statistically
    significant allowing us to reject the null hypothesis. The p-value depends on
    the size of the data being tested: the larger the sample size, the smaller the
    p-value. If the sample size is large, there is a higher chance of finding a significant
    relationship, if one exists. As the sample size increases the impact of random
    error is reduced.'

    samples from the data to train your model and generate better p-values.

    with speed and accuracy. When training a model with a large dataset, it can become
    very difficult as you will need a lot of computational power and memory to be
    able to process the data. It requires too much time and the process would not
    be efficient as a whole. A solution is:'

    sub-groups known as strata. In stratified random sampling, or stratification,
    the strata are formed based on unique attributes or characteristics such as income
    or age group in census data.

    only worth 1 year is not going to be efficient enough. You will need a minimum
    of 5 years and you need to ensure that there is not a lot of missing data, to

    in days, weeks or months? A year's worth of data could be 365 points of data (days),
    52 points of data (weeks), or 12 points of data (months). All are equally valid,
    however it is about your problem at hand and what you require.
