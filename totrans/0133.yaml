    with the rapid adoption of these tools – along with alarming articles suggesting

    suggesting that AI could cause 300 million jobs to be degraded or lost in American
    and European markets. Cue the panicked headlines.

    is really saying, what kind of job losses we can expect, in what fields, and what
    those most at risk can do to offset the dangers.

    They flag legal and administrative industries with the greatest potential to have
    parts of their job replaced by AI, while manufacturing and construction are least
    at risk.

    by AI. Roughly 63% will be complemented. Around 30% will be unaffected.

    an eventual increase of the annual global GDP by 7%

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and higher productivity
    for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a productivity boom that raises
    economic growth substantially.”

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’d recommend you read the report more than relying on headlines. The Goldman
    Sachs report is much more cautious. The whole report is called “The Potentially
    Large Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Growth,” and there’s a good
    deal of nuance in there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, while Forbes author Jack Kelly [says](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/?sh=4a2cef20782b)
    that the report suggests AI will “diminish” roles, the authors of the original
    report make it clear they expect AI to complement those jobs, not diminish them.
    The authors also make it clear that they expect few employees to be entirely replaced
    by AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine an employee in the admin industry, which the report suggests is one
    of the professions most exposed to AI, with 46% of tasks replaceable by AI. Even
    if you could replace 90% of what one employee does, it’s extremely unlike that
    you can get an AI to do *everything* that employee does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Administrative workers don’t just do basic tasks; they also communicate with
    employees, collaborate to set up meetings, and deal with unexpected issues – things
    only a human can do. If automation could replace administrative assistants, Calendly
    would have done so already.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s basically what the report is saying. Jobs could be at risk, but most
    (93%) won’t be. Most are only exposed, meaning that some of those day-to-day tasks
    might be replaced by AI, but then this will increase productivity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also worth realizing that AI will create new jobs, as the authors of the
    report underlined. “[W]orker displacement from automation has historically been
    offset by creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following
    technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment
    growth,” they write.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many write-ups also claim that AI is already replacing many professions which
    I know for a fact isn’t possible. For example, Kelly goes on to write, “Instead
    of a live person addressing a problem, you can engage with an online chatbot.
    AI can help diagnose cancer and health issues.” Many medical professionals have
    gone on the record to demonstrate that what they do is not replaceable by AI.

    and the patient had a classic presentation,” he writes, detailing how ChatGPT
    misdiagnosed some patients while failing to ask obvious questions that a human
    doctor would know to ask. “The vast majority of any medical encounter is figuring
    out the correct patient narrative.” And that’s not replaceable.

    unscrupulous CEOs who want to cut costs and use mediocre content generation rather
    than pay a wage. Right now at least, generative AI is not capable of doing everything
    a programmer does like debugging, peer review, and thoughtful problem-solving.

    instance, one of my peers recently told me she lost her job as editor-in-chief
    – not because her boss outsourced the job to AI, but because the entire website
    had lost 90% of their profits due to being outcompeted by AI-generated content
    on those keywords.
  prefs: []

    risk. For example, the Goldman Sachs study says that the admin, law, and information
    processing industries are most at risk. Another study [says](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf)
    that writing and programming are on the chopping block; science and critical thinking
    are not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do think it’s worth highlighting that sometimes those are not mutually exclusive.
    Which programmer has never used critical thinking? That’s what makes me believe
    it’s not AI per se that’s causing job loss; it’s people in charge trying to save
    a buck. And I believe they’ll regret it in the long term.

    anytime soon, but I have learned to use AI to draft emails, capture transcriptions
    of important calls, summarize long articles to save time, get technical help with
