    medieval times, a Unicorn was a rare and mythical creature with great powers.
    In today’s world, a similar mythical creature is a Data Science Unicorn, who knows
    equally well the technology, data science, and business. Such professional is
    a most valuable resource of any data science team. Many data professionals are
    experts in the first two areas – technology and data science, but lack business/domain
    skills.'

    about understanding business and its strategic problems, asking the right questions,
    and using technology along with data science to solve those problems. Failure
    in clearly understanding the business and its problems can doom data science/analytics
    projects and ultimately whole business strategy. Typical analytics teams consist
    of business/data analysts (who know business, define business problems, and interpret
    the data science results from business point of view), data scientists (who are
    data science experts) and data engineers (who are technology experts, developers,
    testers and administrators).

    correctly understanding the problem or interpreting the results after integrating
    their expertise. So, a champion is the one who knows all 3 areas and helps the
    team to better understand business and its problems, to find innovative solutions
    and interpret results in correct way to add value to the business. This  blog
    gives an overview of the business side of data science, especially for technology
    and data science professionals who want to advance their analytics career and
    become a “Unicorn”.![Data Driven Business](../Images/63e5d1d5a8f76ddda31677b87692e7c4.png)
