    science. The hard part is choosing the right format for it. Do you go for a data
    science bootcamp? Do you aim to get a degree? Do you try an online course instead?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The answer boils down to: it depends. It depends on how much time and money
    you have, whether you love being a self-taught learner or not, and if you have
    any pre-existing knowledge about data science. Do you want to be a freelancer?
    Is data science just a hobby? Do you want to dive into a data science job?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data science bootcamp typically runs for 3-6 months. It’s an intensive deep
    dive into data science. Some bootcamps only cover one language, others run through
    all the basics. Although there are part-time options, you should expect to spend
    around 40 hours per week as a minimum doing this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data science degree is a more holistic, slower, and expensive option. You
    can go for the two- or four-year option from an accredited university, although
    these days, most folks go for an option like EdX or Coursera to do a course from
    a university that way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    covering beginner to advanced, Ruby to Python to Perl, video, cohort-based, free
    to thousands of dollars, and every other flavor of learning you can imagine.

    of the data science, bootcamp is the sheer intensity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Want to be fully immersed in a learning environment until you can eat, sleep,
    and breathe code? A bootcamp is the right choice for you. It’s a *lot* of work,
    but it’s rewarding. These boot camps will be as time-intensive as a full-time
    job, plus homework. It’s a great way to learn quickly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Boot Camps are a systemized learning experience. It’s like doing college on
    steroids. You have lectures, office hours, homework, and even career guidance
    sessions. They’re the full package. Many even offer job guarantees at the end,
    because they’re that confident in their ability to teach you employable skills.
  prefs: []

    pivot slowly to incorporate new languages and techniques, boot camps will teach
    cutting-edge technology, which helps you compete for jobs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The downsides of a data science bootcamp are, like I mentioned above, similar
    to the pros. It's intense. You will spend a lot of money. The [average cost of
    a data science bootcamp](https://blog.boot.dev/education/cost-of-coding-bootcamp/)
    in 2020 was about $13,500.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In addition to money, you’ll also spend a lot of another precious resource:
    time. Many boot camps require 40-hour weeks, not including the time that it takes
    you to complete assignments and do your homework. It''s not the kind of thing
    you can do if you have a job unless you have a very understanding boss.'

    much you can do about it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    rather than teaching you data science, many boot camps skip the foundations of
    data science. Most boot camps are not going to teach you a lot of the basic math
    and statistics that go into data science.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sure, you'll be able to code like a wizard, but you will lack crucial knowledge
    that may become relevant. Also, if you lack the foundations, it’s harder to build
    out your knowledge later on. YOu may be able to memorize Python syntax, but if
    you don’t understand what a two-tailed T-test is, you might struggle. There's
    always a chance that you'll be questioned on that kind of thing at an interview
    – employers don’t want you to just spit code out, they want to know you understand
    it too. If you can't prove that, you might find yourself without a job.

    data science. For this article, I’m not going to include the Coursera or EdX options
    because those go in under data science online courses. I'm talking about picking
    a major, living in dorms, and sitting in lecture halls for your data science degree.

    It's almost the complete opposite. The very best part of the data science degree
    is that you get a full, comprehensive understanding of data science. And it's
    not just going to be data science – you'll get cryptography. You'll understand
    the math behind algorithms. You'll know how to run statistical analyses. And,
    bonus, although most employers don't need a data science degree, it doesn't hurt!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll get exposure to many more topics because a degree isn’t narrow in scope
    like a bootcamp is. And you’ll get more soft skills, too. Bootcamps are trying
    to shovel in as much employable info as fast as possible. A data science degree
    is teaching you to learn, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, you’ll be rigorously tested. A degree requires you to pass - that’s
    what’s so valuable about the diploma because it proves you learned the material
    well enough to score points on a test. This test will show you exactly where your
    strong and weak points are, which can help you shore up your knowledge even further.

    Beyond the cost of education, you’ll also be paying for room and board for two
    or four years. A public university degree – the cheapest option – will set you
    back around $14.9k per year if you’re off campus, living at home. The most expensive
    option, being on-campus at a private nonprofit university, costs $54.4k per year.'

    aspects. The goal is to teach you, not employ you. While this means you get a

    not get the same advantages in terms of employability.
