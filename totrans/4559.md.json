["```py. From a file, inside R or R Studio, you can create and render useful reports in output formats like HTML, pdf, or word. However, the primary benefit is that source code, outputs, and comments are contained in one file, facilitating easy collaboration among your team.\n\nEven R lovers may not know that Rmd files can contain Python chunks. More conveniently, objects are shared between the environments, allowing programmers to call objects in Python and R in the opposing language.\n\n### **R Markdown with Python**\n\nLet’s examine how to use Python in Rmd. First, ensure Python is installed on your computer and all Python libraries or modules you’re planning to use in Rmd are installed (pip works and [virtual environments](https://www.lukaskawerau.com/rmarkdown-with-python-and-virtual-envs/) can be utilized, if preferable).\n\nIn Rmd files, Python code chunks are similar to R chunks: Python code is placed inside marks: ```", "```py.\n\nHere’s a simple R markdown with embedded Python code:\n\n![](../Images/c3be788ab84d38fdb1fd17dbd3ef6028.png)\n\nIn the example above the csv is loaded with the help of the pandas library, a column is renamed, and the first rows are printed. In the file heading, the report is defined with ### and a single author comment is printed. Here’s the result when we run the Rmd:\n\n![](../Images/5d86bbd6c4c669b245ea6a44398a5591.png)\n\nBeside the code and output, the heading and author comment prints. Now that the data has been loaded using Python, it can be used inside R:\n\nThe R code starts with ```"]
