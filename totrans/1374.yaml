- en: Data, Data Everywhere, not a drop to act! Every organization is collecting data
    today, but very few know what to do with it. Part of the challenge is, organizations
    don’t know what to ask of data. Where to begin? They have made multi-million $
    investments in instrumentation and collecting BIG data through [Hadoop-cluster](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/Hadoop-cluster),
    spitting out billions of rows and thousands of columns, but now what? Where to
    go next?

    answer.” But soon they realized, data doesn’t speak, it only responds.

    smarter decisions) to ask the “right” questions. But what questions to ask?

    web servers at a health industry giant like Kaiser Permanente or a marketing manager
    at a large bank like Wells Fargo, the key questions remain the same. They are:'

- en: For the CEO of the apparel business, it means how is the apparel business doing,
    and for the marketing manager, it means how is his/her department doing? There
    are many ways to answer this question, including laying out a financial measurement
    framework, a balanced scorecard, or something in between. But the most important
    part is to understand and agree company-wide on the KPI or set of KPIs (Key Performance
    Indicator) for your business. Is it revenue that you are optimizing or margins?
    Is it penetration or NPS (Net Promoter Score) or some integrated index?

- en: Once you have a KPI identified, you need to understand what drives that KPI.
    Some of this can be derived mathematically, and some could be a mere hypothesis
    that needs to be validated. For example, the number of visitors and conversion
    are important drivers of revenue for the apparel business. On the other hand,
    for a gaming company, with a freemium model and less than 1% paying customers,
    the total number of players is not a driver of revenue, but the number of players
    on a certain game might be. What’s important here to understand the dynamics of
    your specific business through portfolio analysis.

- en: Customer is central to all of our businesses. And we know all our customers
    are not alike. Some are more sophisticated, a heavy user of our product; others
    have used our product only once. For the apparel business, there might be two
    macro customer segments, those who would buy product wholesale to retail in their
    boutiques and those who are buying for personal use. Their needs from the eCommerce
    site and the company would be different. Companies who understand their customers
    and customize their offering, messaging, marketing channel accordingly, delight
    their customers, securing their future revenue (or KPI). And that is, ultimately,
    what we all want to do, to drive our KPI in the right direction.

- en: Granted, most of the high-level executives in an organization do keep an eye
    on the KPIs and can quickly sum up the company financials, but do they know what
    drives those KPIs? Additionally, do the folks further down in the organization
    know what they are working towards and why? Can they make a good decision of which
    project to prioritize over others, i.e., what will drive their KPI the most? KPIs
    are the results we want, but unless we can identify the right levers to pull to
    move those KPI, we are flying blind. It is the answer to these three questions
    that can help identify the critical business levers to manage the business.

    is an iterative one. The process begins by asking these 3 questions at the highest
    level and then iteratively asking hundreds of cascading questions to get deeper
    breakthrough insights needed to maximize the ROI. And to truly incorporate this
    data-driven process of running the business, all individuals in the organization;
    be it the marketing professional, product manager, sales professional, financial
    analyst or business analyst, need to know how to start asking the right questions
    of the data, to optimize their own KPI’s.

    (to capture more data), or fund another marketing campaign or product enhancement,
    answer these three questions to the extent possible with current data set and
    identify what other data and insights you need to understand the levers you can
    pull to make a difference.
