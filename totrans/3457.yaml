- en: Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist for Baidu Research in Silicon Valley, Stanford University
    associate professor, chairman and co-founder of Coursera, and machine learning
    heavyweight, is authoring a new book on machine learning, titled **[Machine Learning
    Yearning](http://www.mlyearning.org/)**.

- en: This isn't your typical machine learning book, however; it focuses on the skills
    and strategies needed to implement machine learning systems, as opposed to acting
    as an overview of various classification algorithms or the current state of the
    ~~art~~ science.

    1-2 page chapters."

    that, if you sign up to the email list by Friday, June 24th, you will gain free

- en: The book itself looks like it may fill a noticeable void in current such offerings,
    when complete. Given that the offer to freely preview chapters as they are written
    seems to be limited by time, I would move quickly to [visit the book's site](http://www.mlyearning.org/)
    and join the list.
