- en: Amazon's Machine Learning University is making its online courses, previously
    only available to Amazon employees, [freely-available to the public](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/machine-learning-course-free-online-from-amazon-machine-learning-university).

    Natural Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8P_Z6C4GcuWfAq8Pt6PBYlck4OprHXsw)**,
    a practice-oriented offering described thusly:'

- en: This content is based on the Machine Learning University (MLU) Accelerated Natural
    Language Processing class. Our mission is to make Machine Learning accessible
    to everyone. We believe Machine Learning will be a tool for success for many people
    in their careers. We teach Machine Learning courses on different topics. This
    class is designed to help you get started with Natural Language Processing, learn
    widely used techniques and apply them on real-world problems.

- en: The concise course, as mentioned above, focuses on widely used techniques that
    can be used for real-world problems. Taught by [Cem Sazara](https://github.com/cemsaz),
    an applied scientist at Amazon, the course is made up of a playlist of video lectures,
    along with a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-nlp)
    of course notebooks, slides, and data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can expect a playlist of mostly bite-size videos varying between 1 and approximately
    30 minutes, though the majority clock in at under or around 5 minutes, with some
    lengthier outliers as warranted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the course and its video lectures are geared towards individuals looking
    for an accelerated path to natural language processing specifically, introductory
    machine learning topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning, imbalanced
    classes, missing values, and model evaluation are first covered prior to graduating
    to NLP techniques.

    into 3 major lectures, while the corresponding notebooks cover practical implementations
    of a mix of general machine learning algorithms useful in NLP applications, NLP
    specific techniques themselves, and the use of Amazon platforms to accomplish
    your implementation goals:'

- en: Overall, this looks to be a great introductory course for beginners to natural
    language processing. Amazon has done the community a service by opening their
    Machine Learning University courses to the public, and between the initial Accelerated
    NLP offering and its kin, it appears that those wishing to learn machine learning
    from a world class machine learning organization now have another option.
