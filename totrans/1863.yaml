    about the nature of their field. What exactly IS Data Science - a question that
    seems to lurk just below the surface...

- en: Data Science is the applied aspect of many theories. My orientation is Bayesian;
    so I have Probability theory at the top. Many other sciences also play a part
    – Physics & Statistical Mechanics for one play a significant role. We have been
    comfortable with L2 optimization (Euclidian distance metric) for a long time but
    there is a ground-swell of activity in L1 optimization (taxi-cab distance metric).
    L1 optimization pushes us out of our comfort zone of mean-squared error optimality
    and associated 2nd-order thinking!

    the topic is “hard-core”! ML is fundamentally concerned with finding the all-important
    “mapping” between input and output vector spaces (for a complete development of
    this topic, see “[SYSTEMS Analytics: Adaptive Machine Learning workbook](http://www.jininnovation.com/NEW-Book.html)”).
    These are so many tools and tricks that developing a comprehensive understanding
    of ML can be frustrating; so I have put together an ontology below that organizes
    all we know about ML. The highlight is the collection of the vast material under
    3 topics: Bayes Theorem, Cover Theorem and Neuroscience & ad hoc methods. In ML
    practice, these ML methods are “wrapped” around by “bootstrap” and “consensus”
    methods.'

    between inputs and outputs and then moving this into “production” under the implicit
    assumption that the relationship will remain unchanged! I challenge this assumption

    ([Box, et al.](https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Experimenters-Design-Innovation-Discovery/dp/0471718130),

    ML maps with strong statistical experimentation discipline, we get robust, repeatable

    Math skills, (2) a coder with database and cloud OS skills and (3) a business
    major with a quantitative leaning. I am yet to meet a single individual who embodies
    all three skills to the depth required! Equally important, the personal temperaments
    for each are starkly different. So, **a real or virtual three-person team is needed
    for rapid Data Science solution development**. Data Science solution deployment
    and operation can often be accomplished by a qualified STEM graduate who has an
    applied statistician’s mind (who appreciates the statistical experimental aspect
    of day-to-day business applications).
