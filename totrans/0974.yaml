    companies don't know how much potential value they are sitting on. In this case,
    we aren't talking about natural resources, we're talking about data. Data mining
    has been touted as the new oil rush for some 15 years now, but the methods of
    refining the crude, raw data are still being discovered, as are the mechanisms
    we can fuel with it.

    their incoming traffic to functions like customer segmentation and targeted marketing.
    Of course, these are ideas that are at the top of the profit yield checklist,
    but part of generating an impressive profit is also mitigating losses to fraud
    – an [increasing concern year on year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1273177/ecommerce-payment-fraud-losses-globally/).
    Data science fuels that bus as well.

    the fraud software now has a user profile that is much easier, and much more conclusive,
    to evaluate. While scrutinizing the profile, a [fraud score](https://seon.io/resources/fraud-scores-how-to-calculate-them/)
    is assigned to each user based on its findings. Potential indicators of fraud,
    like connecting via a VPN, increase the score. After a predefined threshold is
    met, most solutions offer the ability to either stop the user’s progress automatically,
    or else elevate the case to a human counterpart.

    anti-fraud initiative – the most effective kind. Just as with the fraudsters under
    your floorboards, the more data you have about your own company, the tighter the
    security can become. Having well-defined goals – stopping ATO attacks, for example
    – at the outset is paramount, as is [cleaning your data](/2022/01/getting-started-cleaning-data.html)

    algorithms, regardless of what model they rely on, [need to be trained](/2021/04/cogitotech-6-mistakes-avoid-training-machine-learning.html)
    to produce accurate results for an individual company.   Training teaches the
    software the subtle differences between fraudsters and good customers in your
    system, identifying with increasing accuracy what is passable and what is a suspicious
    outlier. Without training, trusting machine-learning algorithms to run autonomously
    is a risky decision, but a well-trained algorithm might need very minimal human
    oversight, freeing up resources.

    begins their shopping journey. Their user data appears legitimate, insofar as
    they have filled out each section of the registration form with a valid entry

    OSINT data associated with the provided credentials, the program notes that this
    user’s email address appears to be new, and their phone number is not associated
    with a single social network – *very* unusual in 2022\. While this user may simply
    be social media agnostic, most fraud stacks can be customized to flag such an
    anomalous user as potentially suspicious, and their journey can be put on pause
    while it is escalated to manual review.

    the website in the last 72 hours. Furthermore, **IP analysis** of all those accounts
    shows locations that are very disparate from the addresses they claimed upon registration,
    and many of those IPs originate from datacenter proxies that have previously been
    flagged as suspicious.

- en: First and foremost, the biggest takeaway for any ecommerce business should be
    that a fraud prevention solution leveraged against incoming traffic is *crucial*
    to curbing fraud inside the system. Fraud techniques are becoming more sophisticated
    all the time, and according to UK Finance, [the UK alone lost **£**2.4 billion
    pounds to fraud](https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/2021-fraud-report) just
    last year.

- en: The second key point is to be aware that any fraud solution will be most effective
    when it is fed the best data available to your model. While providing a low-friction,
    low-churn shopping journey is important for every ecommerce sector, that experience
    has to be measured against your company’s appetite for fraud losses. Adding a
    moment of friction to the customer journey by requesting additional identifying
    information shouldn’t result in a huge ROI dropoff. As well, it may return a much
    more insightful view of your customer base, which, as discussed, is the fuel that
    will drive both your fraud mitigation and, hopefully, your profits.
