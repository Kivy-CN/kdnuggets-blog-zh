    future response based on past observations with known response values. The major
    problem afflicting PA models in this era of big data is the dimensionality issue
    which renders the model building process very tedious and time consuming.

    most influential predictors “explaining” response. There are two conflicting concerns
    here: prediction accuracy, determined by the variance of the prediction error,
    and prediction bias when applying the model results on new observations. As more
    predictors are introduced to a model, model accuracy usually improves, but the
    bias may get worse. Hence a trade-off analysis between accuracy and bias is often
    required to find the “best” set of predictors for a model. Further complications
    are introduced because of such factors as noisy data, redundant predictors, multi-collinearity,
    missing values, outliers and others.'

    methods. In this study we conducted a research to find the best performing model
    involving “representative” models from each class of models – StepWise Regression
    (SWR) for statistical methods, Simulated Annealing (SA) for stochastic methods
    and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) for dimensionality
    reduction methods. SWR was calibrated using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) algorithm;
    SA uses a random, yet systematic, search method increasing its likelihood to converge
    to a global optimum; and, finally, the dimensionality reduction methods collapse
    multiple attributes into a smaller set of “mega” predictors of response.

    it is one of the most common models in Machine Learning (ML) but because it constitutes
    the foundation for many other ML methods.

    model class and then compared the best performing models to one another. At this
    point we ignored transformations of the original variables, which may give advantage
    for some model types over the others, and conducted the comparative analysis using
    the original variables only. All methods were applied on three realistic marketing
    datasets provided by DMEF (The Direct Marketing Educational Foundation), referred
    to as non-profit, specialty and gift, each containing around 100,000 observations
    and scores of potential predictors.

    the model that maximizes R2 for the validation dataset, subject to the condition
    that the ratio between the R2 for the validation dataset and the training dataset
    is more-or-less equal to 1.0\. Maximizing R2 ensure high model accuracy. The constraint
    that the R2 ratio is close to 1 implies no over-fitting. The methods were evaluated
    based on several performance metrics common in data mining, including gains charts,
    maximum lift (M-L) and Gini coefficients.

    SA, PCA and RBF) one on top of the other, for each of the data files mentioned
    above (Figures 1-3). Each gains chart corresponds to the optimal parameter configuration
    for the respective model within the model class. Table 1 presents the corresponding
    summary statistics. All gains charts, as well as the related Gini and M-L measures,
    are presented for the validation datasets.

- en: Surprisingly, the famous SWR model yields similar results to the supposedly
    more powerful SA model. We attribute these results to the fact that people behave
    rationally in the marketplace which, when reflected in the database, yields “well
    behaved” datasets with no complex relationships between the data elements. As
    a result, even the myopic SWR model can identify the most influential set of predictors.
    As to the dimensionality reduction methods, both performed much poorer than SWR
    for all data files. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that in reducing
    the dimensions no regards is given to the response variable thus yielding “weaker”
    predictors of response.

    for marketing applications one may just as well use the conventional SWR algorithm
    to build large scale LR models. Not only SWR is well-known with wide software
    availability, but further studies with this algorithm suggest that SWR has enough
    of a leeway to allow one to use any reasonable range of p-values to remove/introduce
    variables to the model and still get a valid model. While further research is
    required to generalize the results of this study to other domains, for marketing
    applications, in all likelihood, the winner is... stepwise regression!
