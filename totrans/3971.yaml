    Python code by coding examples for each. Let’s get started.

- en: 1\. Use List Comprehensions Instead of Loops
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use list comprehensions to create lists from existing lists and other
    iterables like strings and tuples. They are generally more concise and faster
    than regular loops for list operations.

    names of users who have a score greater than 85.

    You can try out other examples and [profile your code](https://www.kdnuggets.com/profiling-python-code-using-timeit-and-cprofile)
    with timeit to compare the execution times of loops vs. list comprehensions.

- en: List comprehensions, therefore, let you write more readable and efficient Python
    code, especially in transforming lists and filtering operations. But be careful
    not to overuse them. Read [Why You Should Not Overuse List Comprehensions in Python](https://www.kdnuggets.com/why-you-should-not-overuse-list-comprehensions-in-python)
    to learn why overusing them may become too much of a good thing.

- en: 2\. Use Generators for Efficient Data Processing
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use generators in Python to iterate over large datasets and sequences
    without storing them all in memory up front. This is particularly useful in applications
    where memory efficiency is important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike regular Python functions that use the `return` keyword to return the
    entire sequence, generator functions yield a generator object. Which you can then
    loop over to get the individual items—on demand and one at a time.
  prefs: []

    row—one at a time—without loading the entire file into memory at once.

    with streaming data or when the dataset size exceeds available memory.

    function calls and reusing them when the function is called with the same inputs
    again.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NumPy allows you to perform element-wise operations on arrays—as operations
    on vectors—without the need for explicit loops. This is often significantly faster
    than loops because NumPy uses C under the hood.
