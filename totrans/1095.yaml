    hearing a lot about data science but never understood the full meaning so one
    day my friend sent me an article about [**GPT3**](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/)
    and that was it. I was determined to learn this magical world of data science,
    so I decided to take the [Data Scientist with Python Track — DataCamp Learn](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5).
    The learning path taught me about Python programming and statistical thinking.

    and participate in a [DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/46/box-plots-for-education-reboot/).
    This was my first experience of building a classification model, and it completely
    changed my mindset. I was working day and night to climb up the [leaderboard](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/46/box-plots-for-education-reboot/leaderboard/)

    and finally I found [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Kaggle organizes the most
    exciting and challenging machine learning competitions. I was particularly looking
    for beginner-level completions and found [WiDS Datathon 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021/overview).
    This competition has a strict requirement of at least 50% women participants on
    a team and that’s how I found [**Penguin**](https://www.kaggle.com/qypeng12).

    with the necessary tools to start a career in data science. In a typical Kaggle
    competition, female participation is limited due to lack of encouragement and
    support, whereas in WiDS it is the complete opposite, and the competition is dominated
    by female participants. The Datathon also provided a learning experience for beginners
    to work on real-life projects. Learn more at [Results and Impact](https://www.widsconference.org/blog_archive/wids-datathon-2021-results-and-impact).
