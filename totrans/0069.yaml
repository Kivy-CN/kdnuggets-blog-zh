    where the Kaggle community can participate in building a report that will summarize
    the rapid advancements in AI from the past two years. The Kaggle community is
    a diverse group that has a variety of experiences within the depths of AI.

- en: Generative AI has been a popular topic of conversation recently. This starting
    section dives into the rapid progress and applications of Generative AI in the
    past 2 years. We have seen advancements such as text generation, image creation
    and music development using tools and techniques such as GANs and LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This has only been possible with the use of larger datasets and improved hardware
    for enhancing algorithms during their training phase. Although Generative AI is
    still in its early stage, it has shown in the past year alone how it is revolutionizing
    different industries. There are still ethical concerns to take into consideration
    such as privacy concerns, misinformation, and use of these AI systems.

- en: With the hype around Generative AI, there has been a major rise of interest
    in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to the rise of large language models
    (LLMs). Naturally, the next section of the Kaggle AI report focuses on NLP techniques
    and their use in various tasks such as summarisation and translation.

- en: If we take it back, early approaches to text-based tasks included term-frequency-based
    feature engineering in conjunction with non-neural network-based machine learning
    methods. Now we are catering to larger datasets which undergo learning word representation
    for model interpretation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The use of the internet data as a training corpus has allowed these models to
    learn better, and produce better performance in areas such as transfer learning.
    Within Kaggle competitions, there has been a trend in fine-tuning publicly available
    models which have shown to surpass human-level performance.

    video generation has been very popular too. Computer vision has been around for
    a long time, but in recent years it has skyrocketed. We can now handle tasks such
    as object detection and more.
  prefs: []

    in computer vision such as augmentation. Used in a variety of different industries
    such as healthcare for medical imaging, computer vision still has its challenges
    within areas such as deep fakes, ethical and philosophical considerations, limitations
    of multi-modal models and more.

    by looking into its developments and the community's observations of it in the
    past 2 years. Kaggle competitions have been widely popular over the years as the
    community has used the platform to test their skills, build a portfolio and prepare

    labeling, seed averaging, and hill climbing which were once upon a time considered
    "tricks," but have now become common practices. Kaggle competitions over the past
    2 years have become more competitive and competitions such as RSNA, Learning Agency
    and more are very popular.

    society having mixed emotions about the use and implementation of AI systems.
    Organizations are looking into the ethical principles of AI and creating new strategies
    to ensure that they can not only understand the AI systems but also be able to
    monitor and mitigate risks.
