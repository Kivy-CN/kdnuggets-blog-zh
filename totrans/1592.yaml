- en: Data science has become an integral part of many modern projects and businesses,
    with an increasing number of decisions now based on data analysis. The data science
    industry is experiencing an acute [shortage of talents](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/07/13/bridging-the-data-scientist-talent-gap-starts-with-defining-the-current-role/),
    not only of data scientists but also of managers, having some understanding of
    analytics and data science. As a manager, you can ultimately become the company's
    expert in data usage, creating opportunities for the evolution of your organization.
    Whether you are working with a team of data scientists, as a part of a data-driven
    business, or you are interested in implementing data science solutions — you shall
    have some data knowledge and understand its organizational capabilities.

    computer science, math and statistics, and a domain of knowledge requiring the

    concepts and techniques that have revolutionized the business landscape and became
    essential for making beneficial data-driven decisions. We are confident that it
    will be useful and informative for both the data science managers and for those
    facing this rapidly developing field as a client or user.

    way. In the middle, there are two sections of asic knowledge on which any data
    science projects are built, namely **mathematics and statistics** and **programming
    languages**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we are talking about the science that is based on the data, it's evident
    that one of the fundamental knowledges here is **math**. Each algorithm in machine
    learning is based on mathematical grounds, and it is necessary to understand the
    basics of linear algebra, probability theory, and classical statistics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moving forward, all those huge calculations and implementation of different
    algorithms and solutions of data science tasks are realized exactly using various **programming
    languages**. As a manager, you do not need to know how to craft an algorithm or
    understand all the peculiarities of each language, but you must comprehend, which
    languages can implement specific tasks, how well they fit, and their pros and
    cons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The entire right-hand side of the mindmap is directly related to the data science
    sphere. It is a broad concept, which combines three very large areas: **robotics**, **machine
    learning**, and **reinforcement learning** with a further branching of these areas.
    The main task of the manager at this point is to know what are the general algorithms
    of machine learning, in which industries they can be applied, and which use cases
    can they solve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The left-hand side of the mindmap covers the supporting areas of data science: **data
    storages**, **data engineering**, **big data**, **data analysis**, **visualization**,
    and **BI (Business Intelligence)**. They help to clean, process, transform and
    represent data and analyze it from different aspects, in such a way complementing
    different machine learning tasks.
  prefs: []

- en: Data science relies on creating and consuming data, which must be available
    when and where it is needed. This is the exact purpose of **data storages**. Data
    storage is a technology of archiving data in a convenient form. You should be
    aware of the fundamental difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, why you need
    the cloud services, what services provide a more convenient and understandable
    interface, what exactly do you need for particular tasks and other details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main purpose of **data engineering** is to transform data into an easy and
    useful format for analysis. Any data manipulation requires some pre-processing
    of data, and often the qualitative transformation and processing of data play
    a key role in the success of a project. Roughly, the main operations that compose
    data engineering are data scraping, data ingestion, and data cleaning.
  prefs: []

- en: Moreover, working on a data science task, you often have to deal with large
    and voluminous datasets that traditional data-processing tools and instruments
    cannot handle. This is where **big data** solutions come in. In addition to processing
    large volumes of data, big data has some other specific characteristics. Namely,
    it’s the ability to work with data that quickly arrives in constantly increasing
    volumes and abilities to work with structured and unstructured data in various
    aspects in parallel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Data analytics** is a process of obtaining information about the datasets
    and finding the particular insights. It is aimed at searching various dependencies
    between input parameters. Data analytics is an integral part of your company’s
    marketing, finance, business administration, etc.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the data requires understanding, interpreting, and explaining. Everyone
    who works with data acknowledges the importance of the **BI** and **visualization** tools
    for showing what is hidden in the code and making it visible. Every person perceives
    visual information much better and faster, that’s why it is an integral part of
    every analysis as well as data science project. With benefits for both clients
    and developers, it should definitely be in the arsenal of a data manager.

    an ultimate truth, but rather our attempt to show our vision which reflects the
    current state of data science development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no way to highlight the single most important branch for the manager
    as data science is a complex and vast field. But now you will hopefully have a
    general understanding of the main components of modern data science field and
    how they are interrelated, and this could be a good start to expand your knowledge
    in this area.
