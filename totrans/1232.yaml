    out there, and it’s not always obvious what tools you should be focusing on or
    what you should learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The short answer is that you should learn what you enjoy because data science
    offers a wide range of skills and tools. That being said, I wanted to share with
    you what I believe are the top 10 [Python libraries](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/11/top-python-libraries-data-science-data-visualization-machine-learning.html)
    that are most commonly used in data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Pandas
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ve heard the saying. 70 to 80% of a data scientist’s job is understanding
    and cleaning the data, aka data exploration and data munging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pandas is primarily used for data analysis, and it is one of the most commonly
    used Python libraries. It provides you with some of the most useful set of tools
    to explore, clean, and analyze your data. With Pandas, you can load, prepare,
    manipulate, and analyze all kinds of structured data. Machine learning libraries
    also revolve around Pandas DataFrames as an input.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NumPy is mainly used for its support for N-dimensional arrays. These multi-dimensional
    arrays are 50 times more robust compared to Python lists, making NumPy a favorite
    for data scientists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NumPy is also used by other libraries such as TensorFlow for their internal
    computation on tensors. NumPy also provides fast precompiled functions for numerical
    routines, which can be hard to manually solve. To achieve better efficiency, NumPy
    uses array-oriented computations, so working with multiple classes becomes easy.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scikit-learn is arguably the most important library in Python for machine learning.
    After cleaning and manipulating your data with Pandas or NumPy, scikit-learn is
    used to build machine learning models as it has tons of tools used for predictive
    modelling and analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many reasons to use scikit-learn. To name a few, you can use scikit-learn
    to build several types of machine learning models, supervised and unsupervised,
    cross-validate the accuracy of models, and conduct feature importance.

    networks. It uses multi-dimensional arrays, also known as tensors, which allows
    it to perform several operations on a particular input.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and GPUs for highly efficient and scalable models. This feature of TensorFlow
    is also called pipelining.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keras is mainly used for creating deep learning models, specifically neural
    networks. It’s built on top of TensorFlow and Theano and allows you to build neural
    networks very simply. Since Keras generates a computational graph using back-end
    infrastructure, it is relatively slow compared to other libraries.

    library is a blend of different Python libraries, taking its graphical features
    and functions from Matplotlib, for data handling, it uses Pandas, for handling
    R-like formulas, it uses Pasty, and is built on NumPy and SciPy.

    dashboards using Plotly visualizations. Dash is a web-based python interface that
    removes the need for JavaScript in these types of analytical web applications
    and allows you to run these plots online and offline.
