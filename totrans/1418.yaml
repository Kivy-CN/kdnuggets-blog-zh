    not enough to land you a job in this industry. You might have cultivated the skills

    LinkedIn profile or a GitHub account that was last updated months ago, there’s
    no point. If there are significant achievements on GitHub, Kaggle or any other
    public platform, feel free to mention the same in a separate section in your resume.

    content around data science. If your work-ex itself is a testament to your skills,
    you don’t need to put additional focus on these achievements to validate the same.

    your professional identity. The recruiters shouldn’t have to scan your work-ex
