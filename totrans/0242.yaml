- en: The world of data integration is one that's been changing for years. Particularly
    in light of a greater number of employees worldwide working remotely, businesses
    now more than ever need real-time access to their data. With artificial intelligence
    (AI), organizations can more efficiently analyze large sets of information and
    share their analyses across their business.

    create platforms for data integration that cut down on the time it takes to make
    data-driven organizational decisions. With these platforms, businesses can also
    do a better job of securing sensitive user data from breaches perpetrated by bad
    actors. AI and ML also make it easier for companies to be more compliant with
    important data privacy and usage regulations [like the GDPR](/2017/07/gdpr-affects-data-science.html)
    and HIPAA.

- en: In order to maximize AI and ML's potential to analyze lots of data at once,
    businesses must leverage their data intelligence capabilities to create and expand
    their platforms for data integration. Let's take a look at what goes into creating
    a foundation for enterprise-wide data intelligence and how AI and ML can permanently
    transform data integration.

    business performs a use case's sequence of specific actions to generate value
    for business actors. This [automation of processes](https://hbr.org/2018/01/artificial-intelligence-for-the-real-world#:~:text=Broadly%20speaking%2C%20AI%20can%20support,engaging%20with%20customers%20and%20employees.),
    though, is only one of many benefits AI offers when it comes to using data intelligence
    to deliver consistent, reliable results; AI can be used to greatly improve data
    quality and resolve problems predicated on the quality of data, too.
  prefs: []

- en: Artificial intelligence lets organizations make their consistency of data more
    reliable for the sake of ultimately enhancing their enterprise-wide data management
    capabilities. With AI as well as ML, organizations can proactively respond to
    issues related to their data quality rather than reacting in an ad-hoc, unstructured
    manner. An organization could, for instance, continuously write large amounts
    of data to user devices and use AI to better anticipate when users would turn
    their devices offline and make themselves vulnerable to bad actors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Only that, but AI lets businesses also monitor user devices - even those that
    go offline - to signal to them when to stop sending data to those devices. The
    more devices that a business's AI system can monitor, the better it can predict
    user patterns in terms of device usage to anticipate when users will go offline,
    know when to cease the transmission of data, and thus reduce overall repair costs.
    This monitoring strategy also provides businesses with the protections they [need
    to detect anomalies](/2019/10/anomaly-detection-explained.html) in device usage,
    considering data privacy regulations prevent them from controlling how users interact
    with their devices.

    With AI, businesses can now map that data faster than ever before. Faster customer
    data mapping expedites the rate at which organizations can transform their data
    and make the corresponding data-driven decisions.

    customer data [that rely on ML algorithms](/2019/09/data-mapping-using-machine-learning.html).
    These AI-enabled tools let business leaders direct more accurate processes with
    which they can map out customer data -- even non-technical users can use these
    innovative tools to map customer data while their information technology colleagues
    can pursue other, more technical tasks.

    ML algorithms make the analysis of data faster, even when that analysis accounts
    for big data on an enterprise-wide scale. This improved processing of big data
    is most commonly applied to legacy solutions, but it can also be used to parse
    through more modern business solutions like [business texting](https://www.getweave.com/business-texting/);
    improved, AI-enabled big data processing can even be used to create data models
    with the help of ML algorithms when applied to an organization's internal structures
    of big data.

- en: It wasn't all that long ago that most businesses handled their sets of big data
    manually. Modern sources of large sets of data typically come from the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and streaming -- large volumes of data from sources like these,
    simply put, cannot be handled with conventional data integration processes. Thankfully,
    AI that relies on ML techniques can improve the flow of data integration when
    applied to sources like IoT and streaming.

- en: There are several other benefits that AI and ML offer that address common problems
    with business data integration. For one, AI and ML make for a reduced level of
    usage complexity while making it easier for non-technical professionals to handle
    data integration tasks without needing to call on the help of others. This scenario
    results in lower costs of ownership that data integration can impose on users
    who are given data integration responsibilities.

- en: Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques grant
    access to relatively easy-to-use DI templates that process configurable data.
    With the help of AI, these data integration templates become suited to provide
    an intuitive, step-by-step process that non-technical professionals can follow
    to carry out data integration responsibilities.

    techniques [will inevitably increase](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/security-technology/ai-and-the-future-of-work-in-the-united-states.cfm)
    the already high demand that exists for data engineering professionals. Businesses
    should prepare for their future data engineering roles to require professionals
    who understand how to train machine learning models in order to identify data
    quality-related anomalies in customer devices and data usage.

    of machine supervisor -- data engineers will be responsible for training machines
    and ensuring that they accurately associate and classify assets that belong to
    big structures of data. Thankfully, AI is able to reduce time spent on manual
    data integration tasks so that data engineers can become better able to oversee
    their data classification tasks in the context of training machines.
