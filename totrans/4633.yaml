    different outlier detection methods available in the package. I will be using
    information from the PyOD documentation so as to not to cause confusion from overlapping
    techniques.

- en: PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition
    of the data to project it to a lower dimensional space. In this procedure, covariance
    matrix of the data can be decomposed to orthogonal vectors, called eigenvectors,
    associated with eigenvalues. The eigenvectors with high eigenvalues capture most
    of the variance in the data.

- en: Therefore, a low dimensional hyperplane constructed by k eigenvectors can capture
    most of the variance in the data. However, outliers are different from normal
    data points, which is more obvious on the hyperplane constructed by the eigenvectors
    with small eigenvalues. Therefore, outlier scores can be obtained as the sum of
    the projected distance of a sample on all eigenvectors.

- en: The Minimum Covariance Determinant covariance estimator is to be applied on
    Gaussian-distributed data, but could still be relevant on data drawn from a unimodal,
    symmetric distribution. It is not meant to be used with multi-modal data (the
    algorithm used to fit a MinCovDet object is likely to fail in such a case). One
    should consider projection pursuit methods to deal with multi-modal datasets.

- en: This is a type of unsupervised learning outlier detection method. The OCSVM
    algorithm maps input data into a high dimensional feature space (via a kernel)
    and iteratively finds the maximal margin hyperplane which best separates the training
    data from the origin.

- en: The anomaly score of each sample is called Local Outlier Factor. It measures
    the local deviation of density of a given sample with respect to its neighbors.
    It is local in that the anomaly score depends on how isolated the object is with
    respect to the surrounding neighborhood. More precisely, locality is given by
    k-nearest neighbors, whose distance is used to estimate the local density. By
    comparing the local density of a sample to the local densities of its neighbors,
    one can identify samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors.
    These are considered outliers.
