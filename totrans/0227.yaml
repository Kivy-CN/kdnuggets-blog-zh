- en: In AI, machine learning, deep learning, and machine vision, the algorithm is
    the most important subset. With the help of these algorithms, (*What Are Artificial
    Intelligence Algorithms and How Do They Work*, n.d.) the computer, system, or
    the model becomes able to understand what kind of information the user wants to
    process and what kind of results the user wants after understanding some work
    from the surrounding as well. These algorithms are very important in AI as on
    the basis of these algorithms the computer or model will be trained accordingly
    and will be able to train the data that has been provided to it. The most common
    example of these algorithms can be found in Alexa, Siri, or Google Home. The more
    a person or a user interacts with them, their search can become better as they
    can perceive the output from the environment, and mood of the user by observing
    their song collection, interests, likes, and dislikes as well. With the help of
    these factors, the observation of these agents becomes so much strong as they
    interact with the user more frequently. So, it becomes obvious that they have
    very strong algorithms installed which help them to train on their own. There
    are certain algorithms that are very important and are frequently used; random
    forest, logic regression, Naïve Bayes, and Artificial Neural Networks. (*Top 6
    AI Algorithms In Healthcare*, n.d.)

    to solve mathematical problems is the hill-climbing algorithm (*Understanding
    Hill Climbing Algorithm in Artificial Intelligence | Engineering Education (EngEd)
    Program | Section*, n.d.). This problem can be used in job scheduling, marketing,
    ad development, and predictive maintenance as well. It is a heuristic technique,
    or in simpler words hill climbing is basically a search technique or informed
    search technique having different weights based on real numbers assigned to different
    nodes, branches, and goals in a path. Now on the basis of these numbers and the
    heuristic defined in the AI model the search can become better. The main feature
    associated with the hill-climbing algorithm is its large input efficiency and
    better heuristic assignment.

- en: From figure 1 it becomes obvious that the hill-climbing algorithm depends on
    the two components one is the objective function, and the other is state space.
    The current state is the state of the search in which the agent presently stands.
    A local maximum is another goal-oriented solution, but it is not the optimized
    search result. To achieve a better result the model must have achieved a global
    maximum point for better accuracy and precision. (*Introduction to Hill Climbing
    | Artificial Intelligence - GeeksforGeeks*, n.d.). A brief introduction of each
    of the points shown in the above graph is as follows.

    the current state but there is a better state available as compared to the local
    maximum in the system.

- en: The working of this kind of hill climbing is kind of very simple. It collects
    the data from the neighbors of the current node and examines each node. With the
    help of this simple exercise, the current cost of the next upcoming cost can be
    optimized, and hence minimal time has been consumed.

- en: It is a type of hill-climbing algorithm, but it is better than the simplest
    one. It also examines all the neighboring nodes like in the previous techniques,
    but it gives weights or heuristics to the neighboring nodes and based on the technique
    of the least-cost solution finds the shortest path for the goal and achieves the
    goal by that technique. They examine those nodes which are close to the solution.

- en: It is completely opposite to the techniques which are discussed earlier. In
    this technique, the agent doesn’t find the values of the neighboring nodes. It
    selects the neighboring nodes completely randomly and goes on that node and on
    the basis of the heuristic of that specific node the agent then examines whether
    to continue this path or not. (Russell & Norvig, 2003)
