    about an interview. They will look for your LinkedIn profile, GitHub, and Kaggle
    to figure out what value you will bring to their company. The hiring manager will
    also look for the latest blogs or projects you have worked on in the past to prepare
    interview questions so that they can test your intelligence ([catherinescareercorner](https://catherinescareercorner.com/2021/09/22/explore-6-sure-ways-to-ace-your-data-science-interview/)).
    Other than that, working on real-world projects will give you the required experience
    for the job, and with a few projects in your portfolio, you will make a good impression
    on the recruiter ([data-flair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-portfolio/)).

    and told me how he was impressed by my recent competition performance. He asked
    me that he would love to talk more on a call. To be honest, I was surprised by
    how a financial organization this big contacted me through Kaggle and how contributing
    to competition landed me an interview with a principal data scientist.

    focused more on my GitHub profile rather than my resume. After this interview,
    I realized how much recruiters are interested in a portfolio rather than a LinkedIn
    profile or resume.

    in my country. My first interview was taken by three experts in their field. They
    asked me about my past work and my goals. After the initial introduction, we dove
    into detailed discussions about my projects and Deepnote profile. The expert data
    scientist asked me key questions about NLP and how I was using them in my projects.
    They went through top projects and asked me about how I solved certain problems.
