- en: Pause for a moment to realize the number of machine learning models trained
    on crowdsourced data from social media and the web, and realize how easy it is
    to poison training data. In fact, this [Microsoft paper from last year](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05646.pdf)
    identifies it as a top concern (p.2). Driven by foundational models, large-scale
    models, and autonomous systems, ML safety is quickly becoming a broad topic encompassing
    many areas of AI and ML. Adversarial attacks, backdoor model vulnerabilities,
    real-world deployment tail risks, risk monitoring, and boosting defense are a
    few of the topics to fall under the ML safety umbrella. Expect to hear a lot more
    on this fast-trending topic.

    have been all the rage over the last few years, deserving acclaim for their breakthrough
    accomplishments. Termed foundational models by the Stanford HAI center, these
    models have come under new scrutiny. A single model can be employed across many
    applications, amplifying the challenges and risks of machine learning system design.
    Understanding the power, opportunity, and risk associated with these models will
    be fundamental to building responsible AI. ODSC West will feature many of these
    models, dissecting their capabilities and vulnerabilities.

    heavy industry investment and a wall of VC funding. Dig a little deeper and you’ll
    notice a lot of unsolved problems in what, acronyms aside, is the ML systems engineering
    space. Once deployed to production, ML engineers need to monitor for model drift,
    data drift, data degradation, model improvement, and of course error detection.
    Observability is not just for real-time systems or even production environments.
    Applying the discipline of ML observability can identify problems early and display
    the belief that some ML lifecycles are static. ODSC West will have one of its
    strongest lineups of data engineering and MLOps sessions to date.

    a lot of attention for generating deep fakes, but they have also been successfully
    used in hidden Markov models, GANs, bayesian networks, autoregressive models,
    and more. DGMs are neural nets with many hidden layers trained to high-dimensional
    probability distributions using a large number of samples. Despite these early
    successes, the broader use of DGMs is still in the early stages. It’s one of the
    hottest research topics in many of the top universities as researchers seek better
    ways to design and train these models. With this continued focus from some of
    the industry’s top minds, we can look forward to more breakthroughs and wider
    adoption for practical applications.

    machine learning models without jeopardizing data privacy continues to gain importance.
    Responsible AI is a broad term employed by industry while practitioners prefer
    to focus on the many challenging issues of ensuring true end-to-end, privacy-preserving
    machine learning models. The focus is now on all states of the machine learning
    life cycle, including understanding privacy as it relates to training data, model
    inputs, model weights, model outputs, and model monitoring. Additionally, the
    field is evolving beyond basic **differential** **privacy** techniques, such as
    purposely introducing statistical or other types of noise to model inputs and
    outputs. Machine learning practitioners will find the latest on this topic at
    ODSC West.

    Recursive Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks’ (RNNs) specialty for
    processing sequential information, such as text, make them especially useful for
    NLP models. Deep Generative Models (DGMs), as previously mentioned, have led to
    massive breakthroughs in NLP. ODSC West will have [**many exciting sessions on

    that engineers and experts in AI broaden their knowledge of cybersecurity. In
    addition, cybersecurity is a field that is rapidly growing thanks to the deployment
    of machine learning tools and methods. Experts are employing machine learning
    to help predict and craft better threat incident response, monitor and counter
    evolving threats, and vastly speed up digital forensics techniques. Add to this
    the increased risk of adversarial attacks on machine learning, deep learning,
    and autonomous systems, and you have a field that’s poised to grow massively over
    the next decade. This is a [**new focus area for ODSC**](https://odsc.com/california/ai-for-cybersecurity/?__hstc=39712252.8eec8d7f5738faf6416f0c6bad9fe9a5.1634042255273.1635870813851.1635885555078.68&__hssc=39712252.3.1635885555078&__hsfp=2238041096).
