    share a common data representation and API design for harmony and fluency in the
    data science workflow, designed for better consistency, and easy to install. It
    can be considered as **the data science and data management toolbox in R **as
    it was built for guiding its users through workflows that improve reproducibility
    and communication.

    data science tasks like importing, plotting, wrangling and modeling data as well
    as functional programming for new developments. The bone marrow of this super
    package is comprised of a robust array of R packages as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr,
    readr, purr, and tibble among others. We will go into the details of each of these
    packages further along as we will show some basic examples to get you started
    with this amazing toolbox. This package is intended to be a harmonious and compatible
    set of tools and commands that bring to life the by-the-book definition of an
    effective data science workflow.

    behind it. This ‘package of packages’ was developed by Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist
    at RStudio and co-author of the amazing O’Reilly series book “R for Data Science”;
    he is also in charge of maintaining it to its best. You may already be familiar
    with Hadley as he developed previous R packages like reshape, reshape2, and plyr;
    which in turn, were building blocks of tidyverse as a product of several experiments
    and versions. It was created for statisticians and data scientists with the sole
    purpose of boosting their productivity and as an attempt to reproduce and abstract
    the Canonical Data Science Workflow (figure) into an actual product. This is an
    extremely versatile and consistent package as its powerful features range from
    productivity and workflow enhancement to new data science software development
    and data science education.

    so we can see it in action later in our practical example. Its consistency is
    deeply rooted in the fact that variables, functions, and operators follow regular
    patterns and syntax. For example, the first argument of every function will be
    a tidy data frame (one row per observation, one column per variable, one entry
    by cell). To perform operations, one can intuitively connect a sequence of commands,
    base functions, and operators to create a tidy pipeline. The way in which the
    core packages are organized, the coding style and testing procedures comprise
    a second, lower-level degree of consistency, so when we say the word “consistent”,
    it should not be taken lightly. Finally, because there is a one-to-one relationship
    between the analysis workflow processes and the different tidyverse sub-packages,
    it is extremely easy to establish effective end-to-end workflows that respond
    to specific analytic purposes and utilize several types of data.

    both experienced and beginners. In fact, those looking to learn R in Data Science
    should definitely start with tidyverse as it has a friendly, low-steep learning
    curve that allows an early-career professional to clean and tackle nontrivial
    datasets in short time.

    of the fluency and consistency we mentioned. You may look at the documentation
    linked below for further information on the additional packages that are loaded
    when using tidyverse.

    way of reading rectangular data and its flexibility allows parsing different data
    types. Additional to readr, secondary packages will be loaded as well, such as
    readxl and haven among others. You may find more information [here](https://readr.Tidyverse.org).'

    version of an R data frame, although quite stubborn and sluggish. However, this
    is not a limitation but a good thing as it requires that you tackle issues early
    in the pipeline, which will lead to a more elegant code. For more information
    visit [this link](https://tibble.Tidyverse.org).

- en: tidyr allows you to create tidy data, i.e., one column for each variable; one
    row for each observation and one value per cell. With its new functions gather()
    and spread() you can perform the classic “cast” and “melt” from previous R packages
    so you can go from wide to long and vice versa easily and effectively. More information
    on tidyr [here](https://tidyr.Tidyverse.org/).

    the R language. It is a set of grammatically consistent verbs for data manipulation
    and it is incredibly intuitive and powerful. Its primary functions are mutate(),
    filter(), select(), summarise(), and arrange(). These can be used to perform operations
    by group by using the command group_by(). More information on tidyr [here](https://dplyr.Tidyverse.org/).'

    to create data visualizations based on the Grammar of Graphics. You simply input

    ggplot2 will take handle the rest. More information on tidyr [here](https://ggplot2.Tidyverse.org).'

    from the Kaggle competition, which you may easily download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
    The purpose of our example is to run you through some common operations you can
    perform in tidyverse and show a bit more the syntax and the power of the consistency
    of this super R package. I hope you enjoy reproducing this code yourself. I encourage
    you to go through the documentation so you can come up with your own tidyverse
    recipes for data analysis.

    example. This is called the pipe operator and it is very useful when scripting
    as it allows you to keep track of the logic of your analysis. Think of it in the
    following way: The function f(x) is now expressed as x %>% f.'
