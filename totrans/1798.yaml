- en: This is the final of three articles. The first outlined [Four Problems in Using
    CRISP-DM And How To Fix Them](/2017/01/four-problems-crisp-dm-fix.html), while
    the second discussed [Bringing Business Clarity To CRISP-DM.](/2017/01/business-clarity-crisp-dm.html)
    This article discusses the two related problems of how analytics are deployed
    and managed once the analytic work is complete. A focus on the business decision-making
    involved helps address both problems. In CRISP-DM this involves changes to the
    Deployment phase and the iteration loop as shown in Figure 1.

- en: A depressingly large number of analytic models that would help the business
    never actually do so. Many analytic models get developed but are not deployed
    and used in a reasonable time-frame (or indeed at all). As the survey results
    on a recent International Institute for Analytics webinar showed, 60% of projects
    failed to act on their analytics in “months”. Results from other surveys and research
    suggest that for many of these analytics, months turn into years and that many
    analytics are never deployed at all. Teams that want to develop analytics that
    make a difference need to include deploying their analytic into production, and
    integrating it with their business environment, as a critical step in the project.
    This is what the Deployment phase of CRISP-DM is for.Several elements go into
    successful deployment.

    (is it visual or numeric, fixed or interactive for instance) must match the style
    of decision making intended. An automated decision, embedded in a website, requires
    a different approach to a manual decision being made by a call center rep. An
    analytic that must be used to make a decision by a mobile worker is different
    from one that supports a desktop worker and so on. A decision model reveals the
    organizational impact and shows whose behavior will have to change as well as
    the systems or processes will have to be re-coded around the analytical decision.
  prefs: []

- en: Analytic teams must also remember that decision-making requires an analytic
    model to be wrapped with decision-making logic to make it actionable.  A decision
    model shows how to do this, modeling the non-analytic elements of the decision-making
    as well as showing how the analytic is used by the decision. For instance, a decision
    model for claims processing might include a fraud prediction as well as audit,
    regulatory and policy-based exclusions.

    the way people make decisions, or changing the degree to which their systems make
    decisions for them, is almost always complex. A decision model provides a framework
    for understanding who is making which decision where and when. It also ties this
    decision-making to new and existing business metrics. This provides a clear picture
    of the organizational change that will be necessary.

    good decision today might not make a good decision tomorrow. Analytics also age
    as data changes and must be monitored and kept up to date. An analytic model that
    is deployed and left unmonitored and unchanged risks becoming less effective and
    potentially even harmful.

- en: Analytic teams need to identify the business and environmental factors that
    might cause an analytic model to become less effective. They must define the data
    that needs to be captured to show that the analytic works and to identify when
    it starts to work less well for any of these reasons.They should consider if the
    machine learning and adaptive analytic techniques are appropriate to continually
    refine the model and what boundary or alert conditions the business might require
    for such models. If manual updates are going to be required, then the schedule
    or triggers for these updates need to be defined. A clear plan should be developed
    for evolving each analytic deployed.

- en: A decision model shows the structure of a decision. This structure can be used
    to determine what interim results and business outcomes should be tracked. Combined
    with data about the model and its behavior, this allows ongoing monitoring and
    improvement of both the analytic model and the business decision it influences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The decision model also shows clearly which external business influences matter
    to the decision-making so that these can be watched for change.For instance, new
    or changed regulations may influence how the constraints on a decision and so
    undermine the effectiveness of an analytic unless changes are made.
