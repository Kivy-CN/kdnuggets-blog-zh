    their current salary. However cliche, it is still important to remember these
    two things when asking for a higher salary: it does not hurt to ask, and sometimes,
    you will not get what you do not ask for. **Please keep in mind that these are
    more general statistics**, as you could be specific as you want to be to see what

    one another, however, there are some key differences, and those can lead to different
    salaries. With that being said, let’s jump right into some salary examples for
    both of these roles below from real data.

- en: The average city salaries themselves seem more aligned with reality, whereas
    the specific skills associated with cities seem too low. I believe the reason
    that is, is because when you filter by specific skill, you are stripping away
    all the other skills. So, a workaround might be to find the average salary of
    the city and then compare the difference between the above skills to get a more
    realistic salary estimate.
  prefs: []

- en: I do think it is interesting that the NLP skill is less lucrative than Tableau,
    however, I think NLP is perhaps too specific and maybe less misunderstood, whereas
    Tableau is widely understood, and most data scientists do not think to add that
    to their resume since it is more data analyst oriented— this note might be something
    to keep in mind as you realize your salary or edit your resume — the long story
    short, do not make assumptions, and look to be unique with your skillset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do not know many data scientists who use Java, but I did think it was interesting
    that the data included in these reports had that skill as an option, so maybe
    there is a market out there for Java for a reason I am not sure of (perhaps, it
    is software engineers transitioning to data scientists).

    when adding a skill — this statement reiterates that you might want to add all

    York saw the biggest jump with Scala, which personally, I agree with, as it is
    a great skill and quite difficult to master.

    or why not? What other factors do you think are important to point out in regards

    and are reported by PayScale, and other actual data scientists, data engineers,
    data analysts, and machine learning engineers. So, these articles are in turn
    discussions around real data and are intended for you to better gain an understanding
