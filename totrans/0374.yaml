- en: If you are from a non-computer sciences background, you know the amount of work
    it is, to crack a job in the world of Data Science. The opportunities of Data
    Science call for a lot of people but with Data Science being so new to the world
    (not more than a decade has passed!), there are very few people who are organically
    qualified to be data scientists as per the norms of the corporate world.
