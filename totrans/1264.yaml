- en: Graphs do more than just provide an elegant theoretical framework, however.
    They offer a mathematical foundation that we can build upon to analyze, understand,
    and learn from real-world complex systems. In the last twenty-five years, there
    has been a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of graph structured data
    that is available to researchers. With the advent of large-scale social networking
    platforms, massive scientific initiatives to model the interactome, food webs,
    databases of molecule graph structures, and billions of interconnected web-enabled
    devices, there is no shortage of meaningful graph data for researchers to analyze.
    The challenge is unlocking the potential of this data.

- en: This book is about how we can use machine learning to tackle this challenge.
    Of course, machine learning is not the only possible way to analyze graph data.
    However, given the ever-increasing scale and complexity of the graph datasets
    that we seek to analyze, it is clear that machine learning will play an important
    role in advancing our ability to model, analyze, and understand graph data.
