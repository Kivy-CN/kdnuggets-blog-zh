    are a 4 person collective, the members of which gained superpowers when exposed
    to cosmic rays while on a space flight. Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic can stretch,
    reshape, and contort his body in inhuman ways, and is the group leader. Susan
    Storm aka Invisible Woman is Reed Richards' wife who possesses the ability to
    become invisible. Johnny Storm aka Human Torch is Sue Storm's brother who has
    the mastery of fire, which allows him to engulf his body in flame, and also has
    the power of flight for some reason. Ben Grimm aka The Thing is Reed Richards'
    best friend who has been transformed by the cosmic rays into a rock-like monster
    with superhuman strengh.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the problem domain. Having sufficient domain knowledge is crucial to success.

- en: What **exactly** constitutes sufficient domain knowledge? It's relative. Are
    you doing a shallow descriptive analysis of some run-of-the-mill dating app? Or
    are you undertaking some in-depth predictive analytics project in finance for
    an organization which specializes in some obscure securities investment strategy?
    The required knowledge of the "dating" domain to perform the first feat is likely
    negligible, but any useful insights into the second will certainly demand a solid
    financial understanding.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Context-dependent minimal levels of expertise aside, you also need to understand
    the questions being asked. This is separate from understanding the domain. You
    may be a *bona fide* financial system whiz, but if you don't have a handle on
    what questions are being posed in a project — which are a direct catalyst to how
    you undertake the project in its entirety — the results will be lackluster at
    best, and completely useless at worst.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Investigating the data basically boils down to gaining a familiarity with the
    data of a given project. [Exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis),
    or EDA, is a particular approach to this gaining of familiarity, generally focusing
    on summarizing a dataset statistically and visually.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a high level, EDA is the practice of using visual and quantitative methods
    to understand and summarize a dataset without making any assumptions about its
    contents. It is a crucial step to take before diving into machine learning or
    statistical modeling because it provides the context needed to develop an appropriate
    model for the problem at hand and to correctly interpret its results.

    algorithms, it can become tempting to skip EDA. While it’s understandable why
    people take advantage of these algorithms, it’s not always a good idea to simply
    feed data into a black box—we have observed over and over again the critical value
    EDA provides to all types of data science problems.

    parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse
    data" in the context of "mapping data from one 'raw' form into another..." all
    the way up to "training a statistical model" which I like to think of data preparation

    you have some reasonable procedural approach in mind which is standardized, reliable,
    and measurable. Well known examples of such formal frameworks include Knowledge
    Discovery in Databases (KDD) Process, the cross-industry standard process for
    data mining (CRISP-DM), and Joe Blitzstein and Hanspeter Pfister's Data Science
    Process. You can read more about these approaches [here](/2016/03/data-science-process-rediscovered.html).
