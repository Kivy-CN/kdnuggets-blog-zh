    the data they generate daily from the users. With the help of a machine or deep
    learning algorithms, they can analyze the data. Afterwards, they can make the
    prediction of testing data in the production environment. But suppose we start
    following the mentioned process. In that case, we may face problems such as building
    and training machine learning models since this is time-consuming and requires
    expertise in domains like programming, statistics, data science, etc.

    the picture, which emerged as one of the most popular solutions that can automate
    many aspects of the machine learning pipeline. So, in this article, we will discuss
    AutoML with Python through a real-life case study on the Prediction of heart disease.

    of death worldwide. The only way to reduce such types of impact is to detect the
    disease early with some of the automated methods so that less time will be consumed
    there and, after that, take some prevention measures to reduce its effect. So,
    by keeping this problem in mind, we will explore one of the datasets related to
    medical patient records to build a machine-learning model from which we can predict
    the likelihood or probability of a patient with heart disease. This type of solution
    can easily be applied in hospitals to check so doctors can provide some treatments
    as soon as possible.
