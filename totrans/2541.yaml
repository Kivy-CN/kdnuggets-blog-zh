    and help shed light on the latest trends in the adoption of machine learning (ML)
    in the industry.

- en: Attend any tech conference or read any tech publication, and you are likely
    to see compelling and inspiring applications of ML and AI in every field — from
    manufacturing to entertainment. Do those stories and data points reflect the general
    state of machine learning adoption in the industry?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our goal with this survey is to understand aggregate trends about the production
    use of machine learning. What is the level of adoption of ML in the industry,
    how do those trends vary by verticals, what are the primary motivators, what are
    the main detractors that slow adoption, which libraries and frameworks dominate
    the conversation, etc.
  prefs: []

- en: The survey is completely anonymous and only takes 3-4 minutes to complete. Aggregate
    survey results will be published on www.anyscale.com in September 2021.
