    my take on this.

- en: In an article I wrote some time back, I strongly disagreed with the notion that
    automated AI software could [ever replace data scientists](/2022/01/data-science-dying-career.html).
    My argument was that these tools would improve organizational efficiency to some
    extent, but lacked customizability and required human involvement at every stage.

    language model, was released.

    of understanding natural language and code.

    also need to use SQL for data extraction, work with software like Tableau and
    PowerBI for visualization, and effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.

    science or analytics will reduce tremendously. Candidates no longer need to possess
    expertise in various software, and can instead harness the power of LLMs to accomplish
    in minutes what would typically take hours.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, in a company I once worked with, I was asked to complete a timed
    Excel assessment since a majority of the organization’s database resided in spreadsheets.
    They wanted to hire someone who was able to quickly extract and analyze this data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    however, will disappear as LLM adoption increases.

    you want to analyze, and ask LLMs questions such as “What is the trend of these
    sales numbers over the last quarter,” or “Can you perform regression analysis?”

    experts are still required to oversee the process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    statistical models. Companies still need to hire employees who are good at statistics
    and programming to oversee the data science process, to ensure that the model
    is prompted correctly.
