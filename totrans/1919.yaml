    of computer graphics. We''ll discuss, in further depth than part 1, sports ranking
    and ways to rate teams from thousands of games. We''ll apply the methods to March
    Madness. We''ll also learn methods behind web search, utilized by such companies
    as Google. We''ll also learn to cluster data to find similar groups and also how
    to compress images to lower the amount of storage used to store them.'

    explaining the real world. Calculus plays a starring role in the biological, physical,
    and social sciences. By focusing outside of the classroom, we will see examples
    of calculus appearing in daily life.'

    The goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize and present numerical information
    in a manner that is illuminating and useful. The course will cover graphical as
    well as numerical summaries of data, starting with a single variable and progressing
    to the relation between two variables. Methods will be illustrated with data from
    a variety of areas in the sciences and humanities.'

    law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small
