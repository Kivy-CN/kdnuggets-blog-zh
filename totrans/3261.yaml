- en: Robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data platforms go
    hand-in-hand. Especially in modern society, it’s extremely common to find these
    technologies working together. Each has also improved and revolutionized the world
    in myriad ways.

- en: Robotics, for example, altered productivity completely — especially in the manufacturing
    and assembly market. Machine learning and AI are contributing to automation systems,
    which can replace human workers entirely. When used in combination with big data
    and machine learning, both AI and robotics can actively improve over time as they
    collect more information.

    the world, and continue to do so. In fact, we’re going to take a look at a few
    industries that are currently being transformed by these technologies — in particular,
    machine learning, AI and robotics.

- en: The health care industry is being transformed almost entirely by these technologies,
    with the widespread use of each becoming more prevalent. Doctors are using robotics
    [to conduct invasive surgeries](http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/robotic-surgery/basics/definition/prc-20013988http:/www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/robotic-surgery/basics/definition/prc-20013988)
    under much safer and more efficient conditions.

    technologies, but it’s still becoming more viable. This includes scanning hardware
    and systems to find ailments or unhealthy body zones, and robotics used to conduct
    surgeries. Some of the tools are designed to perform precise operations without
    the need for a human behind the controls because they are more accurate.

    the new technology powering automation and robotics, but the market is growing.
    The FDA granted approval to a few new systems over the past couple of years, which
    indicates an emergence of new technologies.

- en: Modern and industrial manufacturing was one of the first industries to make
    use of robots and automation systems, [starting as far back as the 1960s](https://www.robotics.org/joseph-engelberger/unimate.cfm).
    It stands to reason that the technology has grown considerably since then.

- en: When they first appeared, robots were used to automate simple, tedious tasks
    humans would find boring or even dangerous. Many systems worked alongside humans
    and still required constant supervision to ensure they were operating effectively.
    Today, however, the robotics and automatic systems used in manufacturing are often
    [more efficient than new or unskilled labor](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/09/industrial-robots-will-replace-manufacturing-jobs-and-thats-a-good-thing/).

- en: When used in combination with AI and machine learning platforms, the robotics
    can become much more advanced, and even intelligent. They also reduce costs significantly.
    For every 1,000 workers, [a single robot](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-statistics-reveal-the-scale-of-robots-replacing-human-workers)
    can replace wages between a quarter and one-half percent.

- en: It may be strange to imagine modern technologies taking hold in the finance
    market, especially when it comes to financial services and customer service. That
    said, in the near future, AI and machine learning will begin to take [a significant
    root in the industry](https://www.techemergence.com/machine-learning-in-finance-applications/),
    all but replacing human advisors.

    financial recommendations. It can analyze social media posts, emails, messages
    and purchase history to offer personalized sentiment analysis on how to handle
    finances.

- en: Over time, AI can also monitor your habits and finances and help with much more
    accurate decisions. More importantly, it can help many financial professionals
    build a strong portfolio. Other areas of interest include fraud detection and
    security, algorithmic trading, loan and insurance underwriting and more.

- en: AI and machine learning are more to blame for advancements in the retail and
    consumer sectors. In marketing, especially, they can help analyze and predict
    customer behaviors to pinpoint viable promotions, advertisements and even product
    channels.

- en: 'Of course, AI and machine learning are behind one of the biggest advancements
    in the industry, one which happens to be seeing immense growth right now: chatbots.
    Chatbots are a modern form of communication that offer 24/7 support to customers.
    They can reach out via one-to-one messaging platforms, and the bots can answer
    queries, handle personal account details, make recommendations and even chat like
    a real human being.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some great examples of chatbots or AI platforms include Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s
    Alexa, but both of those platforms are designed specifically for use in a consumer’s
    home. You’ll encounter customer-service chatbots on a retail site with a chat
    service available.

    seemingly every industry in the near future — from retail and customer service
    to public transportation. The future is certainly bright.
