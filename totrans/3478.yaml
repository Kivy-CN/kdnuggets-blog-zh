- en: 'Most ML teachers like to explain how different learning algorithms work and
    spend tons of time on that. For a beginner who wants to start using ML, being
    able to choose an algorithm and set parameters looks like the #1 barrier to entry,
    and knowing how the different techniques work seems to be a key requirement to
    remove that barrier. Many practitioners argue however that you only need one technique
    to get started: random forests. Other techniques may sometimes outperform them,
    but in general, random forests are the most likely to perform best on a variety
    of problems (see Do we Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification
    Problems?), which makes them more than enough for a developer just getting started
    with ML.'

- en: I would further argue that you don’t need to know all the inner workings of
    (random forest) learning algorithms (and the simpler decision tree learning algorithms
    that they use). A high-level understanding of the algorithms, the intuitions behind
    them, their main parameters, their possibilities and limitations is enough. You’ll
    know enough to start practicing and experimenting with ML, as there are great
    open source ML libraries (such as scikit-learn in Python) and cloud platforms
    that make it super easy to create predictive models from data.

- en: It turns out that, when using ML in real-world applications, most of the work
    takes place before and after the learning. ML instructors rarely provide an end-to-end
    view of what it takes to use ML in a predictive application that’s deployed in
    production. They just explain one part of the problem, then they assume you’ll
    figure out the rest and you’ll connect the dots on your own. Like for instance,
    connecting the dots between the ML libraries you were taught to use in Python,
    R, or Matlab, and your application in production which is developed in Ruby, Swift,
    C++, etc.

    finished his and who was explaining to me how Software Engineers would re-write
    the ML researchers’ code into the language used in production. As Dataiku’s [Florian
    Douetteau](https://medium.com/u/790b578dde3a) [showed](http://fr.slideshare.net/Dataiku/dataiku-productive-application-to-production-pap-is-may-2015-48747796/12)
    at PAPIs Connect last year, the cost of deploying Proofs of Concept into production
    could kill ML projects altogether. Deployment is such an important problem that
    he estimates top companies like Spotify and Facebook each invested more than $5M
    in their ML production platforms (counting 10–20 people dedicated to that, resources,
    infrastructure…).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, today there are new and accessible solutions to this “last-mile
    problem”. They revolve around the use of REST (http) APIs. Models need to be exposed
    as APIs, and if scaling the number of predictions performed by a given model can
    be an issue, these APIs would be served on multiple endpoints with load balancers
    in front. Platforms-as-a service can help for that—here is some info about [Microsoft
    Azure ML’s scaling capabilities](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-faq/#scalability),
    [Amazon ML’s](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/faqs/#generating-predictions),
    and [Yhat’s Analytics Load Balancer](https://github.com/yhat/yhat-wiki/wiki/Analytics-Load-Balancer)
    (which you can also run on your own private infrastructure/cloud). Some of these
    platforms allow you to use whatever ML library you want, others restrict you to
    their own proprietary ones. In my upcoming [workshop](http://www.papis.io/workshops/operational-machine-learning),
    I’ve chosen to use Azure to deploy models created with scikit-learn into APIs,
    and also to demonstrate how Amazon and BigML provide an even higher level of abstraction
    (while still providing accurate models) that can make them easier to work with
    in many cases.

    You should also find appropriate ways to evaluate and monitor your models’ performance/impact,

    value from data with Machine Learning. We’re starting a new series of **2-day
    hands-on workshops in classroom settings and online**. The 1st type of workshop
    we’ve planned is an agnostic introduction to [operational ML with open source
    and cloud platforms](http://www.papis.io/workshops/operational-machine-learning).
    Day 1 covers an intro to ML, the creation, operationalization, and evaluation
    of predictive models. Day 2 features model selection, ensembles, data preparation,
    a practical overview of advanced topics such as unsupervised learning and deep
    learning, and methodology for developing your own ML use case.

    platforms such as Microsoft Azure ML, Amazon ML, BigML and Indico. I think these
    platforms are great for many organizations and real-world use cases, but even
    if for some reason you’d realize they may not be the perfect fit for you, I’d
    still recommend using them for learning and practicing ML. ML-as-a-Service makes
    it much quicker to setup work environments (e.g. Azure ML has most popular libraries
    preinstalled and can run interactive Jupyter notebooks, which you can access from
    your browser) but also to experiment with ML with the higher levels of abstraction
    they provide (e.g. combining one-click clustering, anomaly detection, and classification
    models with BigML, or quickly featurizing text and images with Indico’s Deep Learning
    API).
