    scientists, it is still humble SQL that forms the bedrock of a data scientist’s
    stack. While SQL is usually seen as a baseline skill, it is, in fact, much more
    than that. Despite being almost 50 years old, SQL is becoming *more,*not less
    relevant.

    in the words of Benjamn Rogojan (aka Seattle Data Guy). This is down to the fact
    that the majority of databases are built on one or other of the SQL-based technologies.
    All but two of the [top  ten most popular databases](https://www.statista.com/statistics/809750/worldwide-popularity-ranking-database-management-systems/#:~:text=Although%20the%20database%20management%20industry%20contains%20some%20of,as%20PostgreSQL%20and%20Apache%20Cassandra%20remain%20highly%20competitive.)
    today are based on SQL, the exceptions (MongoDB and Redis) are ranked fifth and
    sixth respectively and even they can be used with SQL. It’s easy to see why anyone
    who needs to query, update, change or in anyway engage with data in relational
    databases is going to be well-served with a solid working knowledge of SQL no
    matter what specialism they end up pursuing.

    into the cloud, so SQL has followed, and, according to [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/why-sql-is-the-most-important-language-to-learn/),
    SQL was the most in-demand skill among all jobs in data in 2021, especially at
    the more junior end of the spectrum. However, even more experienced data scientist
    job postings still list SQL in almost 60 percent of vacancies. What’s more, doubtless
    due to surging demand for data-related expertise, demand for SQL skills appears
    to be [growing, despite a brief dip in 2020](https://www.economicmodeling.com/2021/06/25/skill-spotlight-sql/).
    Pandemic aside, the [SQL server transformation market](https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/564354581/sql-server-transformation-market-is-expected-to-rise-to-us-30-4-bn-by-the-end-of-2029)
    – that helps business address the need for data transformation - is predicted
    to grow steadily at more than 10 percent CAGR until the end of the decade.

    of what was expected of it, let alone recommending it to the wider team only to
    find that it underwhelms. So, when data scientists look at the services and techniques
    out there that will help them query their data more effectively,
  prefs: []

- en: they are probably going to look at the best BI tools and ML extensions that
    will enable them prep the data, create the model and then train it. But all these
    different stages take time and demand high levels of expertise. We’ve been conditioned
    into accepting that ML modelling requires the data to be extracted from the database,
    usually using a BI tool, transformed and loaded into the BI system, before being
    exported (again) to the ML tool, where the magic happens, and transporting it
    back to the BI tool for visualization.

    events…and it uses standard SQL commands. In-database ML is a bit like giving
    your database a brain. It means data scientists – and data engineers, and indeed
    anyone with SQL skills – can work within the database, running ML models to answer
    almost any business question. Predicting customer churn, credit scoring, customer
    lifecycle optimization, fraud detection, inventory management, price modelling,
    and predicting patient health outcomes are just a few of the many use cases in-database
    modelling has enabled. With this approach, all the ML models can be created, queried
    and maintained as if they were database tables, using the SQL language and bringing
    powerful predictive capabilities to a much wider range of data pros.

    movement to simplify and democratize data engineering and data science, breaking
    down the technical barriers that currently exist for those working with data.
    Take, for example [dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com/), a company that’s taken
    the data world by storm, having recently secured [$222 million of funding and
    been valued at $4.2 billion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dbt-labs-raises-222m-in-series-d-funding-at-4-2b-valuation-led-by-altimeter-with-participation-from-databricks-and-snowflake-301489733.html).
    Its data transformation product enables data engineers to build production-grade
    data pipelines from within the data warehouse using SQL commands, radically simplifying,
    speeding up scaling the process of prepping data.

    against a business backdrop that prizes the insights data can offer, data scientists
    are under pressure like never before to produce miracles out of data. A dizzying
    range of tools and services has grown out of the need to speed up and scale the
    data analytics. These tools often demand an investment in time and skill development
    to fully realize their benefits. However, one skill that has often been overlooked
    is humble SQL, the data scientist’s best friend. SQL is not only not going anywhere,
    as the growing movement to innovate closer to the data shows, SQL is becoming
    the data scientist’s strategic secret weapon.
