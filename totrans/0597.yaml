    usually a Kaggle competition where you have a nice large curated dataset that
    comes pre-labeled. Sometimes you have to collect, organize, and clean your own
    data. This process of collecting and labeling data in the real world can be time-consuming,
    cumbersome, expensive, inaccurate, and sometimes dangerous. Furthermore, at the
    end of this process, you can end up with the data that you encountered in the
    real world not necessarily being the data you would like in terms of quality,
    diversity (e.g., class imbalance), and quantity. Below are common problems you
    can encounter when working with real data:'

    be wondering, [what is synthetic data](https://paralleldomain.com/accelerate-your-ai-progress-with-synthetic-data)?
    Synthetic data can be defined as artificially generated data which is typically
    created using algorithms that simulate real-world processes, from the behavior
    of other road users all the way down to the behavior of light as it interacts
    with surfaces. This post goes over the limitations of real-world data, and how
    synthetic data can help overcome these problems and improve model performance.

- en: For small datasets, it is usually possible to collect and manually label data;
    however, many complex machine learning tasks require massive datasets for training.
    For example, models trained for autonomous vehicle applications need large amounts
    of data collected from sensors attached to cars or drones. This data collection
    process is slow and can take months or even years. Once the raw data is collected,
    it must then be manually annotated by human beings, which is also expensive and
    time-consuming. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the labeled data that
    comes back will be beneficial as training data, since it may not contain examples
    that inform the model’s current gaps in knowledge.
  prefs: []

- en: Labeling this data often involves humans hand-drawing labels on top of sensor
    data. This is very costly as high paid ML teams often spend a huge portion of
    their time making sure labels are correct and sending mistakes back to the labelers.
    A major strength of synthetic data is that you can generate as much perfectly
    labeled data as you like. All you need is a way to generate quality synthetic
    data.

    easily get real data. This includes some types of car accident data and most types
    of health data that have privacy restrictions (e.g., [electronic health records](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/ehr-safe-generating-high-fidelity-and.html)).
    In recent years, healthcare researchers have been interested in predicting atrial
    fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm) using ECG and PPG signals. Developing an
    arrhythmia detector is not only challenging since annotation of these signals
    is tedious and costly, but also because of privacy restrictions. This is one reason
    why there is [research in simulating these signals](https://physionet.org/content/ecg-ppg-simulator-arrhythmia/1.3.1/).

    and energy, but can actually be dangerous. One of the core problems with robotic
    applications like self-driving cars is that they are physical applications of
    machine learning. You can’t deploy an unsafe model in the real world and have
    a crash due to a lack of relevant data. Augmenting a dataset with synthetic data
    can help models avoid these problems.

    to normal driving conditions) events like pedestrians at night or bicyclists riding
    in the middle of the road. Models often need hundreds of thousands or even millions
    of examples to learn a scenario. One major problem is that the real-world data
    collected might not be what you are looking for in terms of quality, diversity
    (e.g., class imbalance, weather conditions, location), and quantity. Another problem
    is that for self-driving cars and robots, you don’t always know what data you
    need unlike traditional machine learning tasks with fixed datasets and fixed benchmarks.
    [While some data augmentation techniques that systematically or randomly alter
    images are helpful](https://towardsdatascience.com/augmenting-images-for-deep-learning-3f1ea92a891c),
    these techniques can [introduce their own problems](https://natecibik.medium.com/synthetic-data-and-autonomous-vehicles-408748e5bbb0).

    you to engineer datasets. These APIs can save you a lot of money as it is very
    expensive to build robots and collect data in the real world. It is much better
    and faster to try to generate data and figure out the engineering principles using
    synthetic dataset generation.

    took part in an interview study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09125) that had the
    goal of understanding common MLOps practices and challenges across organizations
    and applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles, computer hardware, retail, ads, recommender
    systems, etc.). One of the conclusions of the study was the importance of development
    velocity which can be roughly defined as the ability to rapidly prototype and
    iterate on ideas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One factor affecting development velocity is the need to have data to do the
    initial model training and evaluation **as well as frequent model retraining**
    due to model performance decaying over time due to data drift, concept drift,
    or even train training-serving skew.
