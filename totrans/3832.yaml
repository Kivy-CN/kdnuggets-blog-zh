    courses called CS50 and gives you the basics of Computer Science. The courses
    are done through the e-learning platform [edX](https://www.edx.org/search?q=cs50&tab=course),
    which is co-founded by Harvard. These courses are free to enroll, however, there
    is a chance to pay a fee to receive a certificate, which you can add to your resume
    or LinkedIn.
