    wrote the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most data science MOOC are introductory-level courses. These courses are good
    for individuals that already have a solid background in a complementary discipline
    (physics, computer science, mathematics, engineering, accounting) are trying to
    get into the field of data science.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And he's right. There are a lot of introductory level MOOCs out there, competing
    with one another for introductory level learners. Which is all well and good,
    if that's what you are looking for. But what if you are a more advanced learner?
    What are your options then? Are there even valid advanced level MOOC offerings?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As Tayo points out, there are lots of alternatives to MOOCs for learning data
    science. There is certainly no reason to treat MOOCs as the go-to option for any
    reason. However, beyond the relative predominance of introductory level offerings,
    there also seems to be a movement dismissing the validity of MOOCs for more advanced
    purposes outright, and there are 2 main reasons for this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, there is a prevailing assumption that everyone taking a data science
    course is someone with absolutely no prior related experience or education, and
    a related assumption that everyone believes that they can become a data scientist
    after a single 4 week course.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, there seems to be a belief that an inordinate number of people are taking
    MOOCs solely for collecting the related credentials, and the related assumption
    that everyone believes that this credential collecting will inevitably lead to
    a successful data science career.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you disregard these assumptions, you can simply see MOOCs as a potential
    learning and skill acquisition tool for students of varying degrees of pre-existing
    skill. Given that many MOOCs are put together by world class instructors and educational
    institutions, there seems to be a good chance that one can learn something of
    value from these courses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With that in mind, this article will look at a few advanced data science courses
    for those who already have a solid understanding of some data science foundational
    skills. What is *advanced*? Well, it's admittedly subjective, but I do my best
    to curate relevant courses of an advanced self-classification. What are *data
    science foundational skills*? Also subjective, and in this case they will vary,
    depending on the particular advanced course being considered.

    2 omits a platform like Udemy, which is open to anyone for course hosting. Point

    related learning concepts over time.

    — leaves us with Coursera and edx. Note that we could have extended this definition
    much further beyond this criteria, or considered MOOC platforms, but this compiled
    list is intended to give some ideas about advanced courses as opposed to being
    an exhaustive curation.
