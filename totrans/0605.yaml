- en: The race to Industry 4.0 and accelerated adoption of digital automation are
    pressure testing organizations across industries. It is becoming increasingly
    matter-of-fact that an enterprise’s ability to leverage data is a key source of
    competitive advantage—this principle especially holds true when it comes to building
    and maintaining computer vision applications. Visual automation models are powered
    by images and videos that capture a digital representation of our physical world.
    In most enterprises, media is captured across multiple sensor edge devices and
    lives in siloed source systems, making the integration of media across environments
    a core challenge that needs to be solved when building a computer vision system
    that seeks to automate visual inspection.

- en: Media becomes even more important in a world where model architectures (the
    code that builds up the neural networks on which an AI model is trained) are increasingly
    commoditized and stable. This means that there are a lot more industry-trusted
    model types and now there is less of a focus on tweaking the code of these models
    to optimize performance and, instead, more of an emphasis on training an industry-standard
    model with the requisite data to best serve your application. In a data-centric
    approach to computer vision model development, organizations must continually
    train models on new ground truth data to protect against [domain and data drift](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-concept-drift-machine-learning/).
    Thus, both large and small computer vision vendors must ensure that organizations
    can continuously bring together media at scale in a programmatic way. Below, we’ll
    explore a few areas that we feel are essential when assessing data management
    solutions for computer vision.

    today probably lives in a variety of commercial cloud environments, on-premises
    systems, and edge devices. What you need is a a way that simplifies connecting
    all your hardware and software. Pre-built connections makes these process seamless
    in just a few clicks instead of a few lines of code. It doesn’t hurt to also have
    a code editor (Python SDK) that lets you build custom connections when needed.
    In short, you don’t want to have to go knocking on your IT department’s door every
    time you need to integrate a new media source. That would be a pain for everyone!

    the data you need quickly, organizational structures like folders, buckets, or
    datasets will help you sort your media. You might want to organize data based
    on the date captured, or maybe you want to keep all the data captured by a single
    production line in the same folder. The choice is yours, just make sure to stay
    consistent.

    this data to find media of interest? This is where a visualization tool that makes
    browsing your large-scale media simple. This might be something you take for granted,
    but seeing thumbnails that quickly refresh on a page and dynamically appear as
    you scroll, or the ability to quickly run through a carousel of images that does
    not take forever to load are problems that organizations face today when trying
    to use commercial consumer applications like to Google Cloud Platform to store
    large scale-media. In short, you need to adopt a solution that has a flexible
    and scalable backend that is built for big data and lets you quickly browse your
    media with minimum load times. Remember, having all this data in one place will
    be essential to the success of your computer vision model.

    this question when dealing with millions of media files. An easy Google-like search
    bar will help you quickly search by name and find your media of interest. Some
    computer vision platforms also let you use a powerful tool called “[visual search](https://www.clarifai.com/use-cases/visual-search),”
    which will automatically detect the content of images and let you search for that,
    making media even more discoverable. Remember that maintaining quick search performance
    for large-scale media is a unique problem and requires a system built to scale
    with increasing dataset size.

- en: Speaking of the discoverability of media in large datasets, let’s talk about
    the blessing that is metadata. Metadata allows you to save “data about your data,”
    things like *this image was captured on October 4th by the Linespex camera in
    a factory in Antigua* exposes so much more information about media than just the
    file name of an image. What’s more is that some data management platforms let
    you create filters based on your metadata that will let you more granularly find
    your media of interest.

    answer this question by letting you understand where your media is coming from
    without having to guess or trace down source systems. Data provenance means that
    you will know what media is coming from what system and how often that system
    is sending new media to the platform. Most organizations will use this information
    to then select new training data based on operational needs. For example, if the
    performance of a model detecting defects on production line 7 is down, let’s first
    try to get a hold of some fresh media from the camera monitoring that line.

    better management of your enterprise media. This is critical for companies to
    have the ability to leverage data to have a competitive advantage. Setting yourself
    up for success means you’ll take data management seriously when selecting your
    computer vision partners.
