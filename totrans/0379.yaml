    market data and generate signals for automated trading systems. It can be a technical
    indicator, a fundamental indicator, or a combination of both. Technical indicators
    use mathematical calculations based on market data such as price and volume to
    generate trading signals. Fundamental indicators, on the other hand, analyze macroeconomic
    and company-specific data to generate signals.
