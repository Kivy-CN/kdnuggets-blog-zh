    do their job properly. However, individual contributors can only recover with
    direction during working hours. That’s why it’s up to the leader to manage and
    organize the team to perform their jobs successfully.

    on my experience and others. So, let’s get into it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In any working team in the business, the members would consist of individuals
    from diverse backgrounds. There are not only cultural differences but also skill
    differences, so it’s important to create an environment that accepts any kind
    of culture while still pushing for members to work together in collaborative ways.

    review process, or having cross-functional projects with several members with
    different skill sets and experience. What is important is eliminating any divisiveness
    and discrimination within the team.

    team members would have difficulty knowing what to do and when to deliver their
    work, leading to disastrous results.

    with the business goals could help the members focus and understand to work better.
    Try to create goals and expectations that are measurable and achievable with a
    proper timeline so we can understand the team's performance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As individuals, we know that we always want to grow. This has also proven true
    for our team members, who want to upskill themselves. This is especially true
    in the data science field, where the field evolves so fast, and people need to
    catch up to them so they can continuously bring value to the company.

- en: By allowing member members to improve, we can keep our team’s skills up-to-date
    and maintain a competitive edge over the competitors. Try to allocate time for
    the team to learn new skills and tools while encouraging them to join workshops
    or seminars. You can also invest in a team to take certification or have a mentoring
    program from the senior to the junior.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have seen that many junior data scientists cannot deliver their top potential
    because they are too afraid of failure or not meeting business expectations. While
    data scientists are hired to solve business problems, there are many times that
    it takes many iterations before we achieve this success. So, it’s much more intuitive
    for the team if we allow them to experiment in their work and could learn from
    the failure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists work through experimentation, and we learn from all the failures
    that happen. By fostering an environment that allows members to try new approaches,
    we encourage them to become more creative and responsible with their work. Celebrate
    any kind of growth, as it would ultimately benefit the company.

    However, it’s important to have a healthy working arrangement suitable with the
    team members to maintain productivity while not burnout any of the team members.
  prefs: []

    It is important for them to enjoy life. Try to lead by example as well in maintaining
    a work-life balance.

    balance.
