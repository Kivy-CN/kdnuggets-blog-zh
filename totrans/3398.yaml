    network called a differentiable neural computer, and show that it can learn to
    use its memory to answer questions about complex, structured data, including artificially
    generated stories, family trees, and even a map of the London Underground. We
    also show that it can solve a block puzzle game using reinforcement learning.

    on the subreddit centers on forming a study group to implement the coursework

    channel that members are using, with instructions to join. Active collaborative
    communities implementing neural network models for educational purposes. Sounds
