    something about it. There are more than 264 million individuals worldwide who
    are suffering from depression. **Depression** is the main cause of disability **worldwide** and
    is a significant supporter of the overall global burden of disease, and nearly
    800,000 individuals consistently bite the dust because of suicide every year.
    Suicide is the second driving reason for death in 15–29-year-olds. Treatment for
    depression is often delayed, imprecise, or missed entirely.

    sports match videos. There are sports websites that tell about highlights of the
    match. Various models have been proposed for the task of extractive text summarization,
    but neural networks do the best job. As a rule, summarization alludes to introducing
    information in a brief structure, concentrating on parts that convey facts and
    information, while safeguarding the importance.
