- en: Google's new experimental product, NotebookLM, is based on the latest advancements
    in large language models. It is similar to other Large Language Model (LLMs) powered
    applications such as ChatPDF, ChatGPT, and Poe, which allow users to upload data
    files and prompt questions. These applications offer the same features and capabilities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google's NotebookLM is a significant breakthrough in how data scientists and
    professionals decipher complex information. Since most of our information is in
    PDFs and stored on computers, NotebookLM allows you to understand your legal contract
    by simply adding all the files and asking essential questions. Although NotebookLM
    lacks some features and accuracy compared to ChatGPT, it has great potential to
    become an essential tool in your workspace as it continues to evolve.
