    of Bard](https://twitter.com/Google/status/1622710355775393793), the tech giant’s
    attempt to dislodge the immensely popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT. And while this
    event was likely designed to generate buzz around Google’s foray into AI chat,
    it quickly became a public demonstration of what can go wrong with these mysterious
    AI-based chat services.

    leading to a drop in  Alphabet’s (GOOGL) stock price by as much as 9% on the day
    of the demonstration. For many in the data community, this did not come as a surprise;
    here’s why.

    solar system.”. This response was quickly identified as incorrect, as the first
    pictures of a planet outside Earth’s solar system were taken in 2004 by the European
    Southern Observatory''s Very Large Telescope (VLT).'

- en: Google CEO Sundar Pichai calls [Bard](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/)
    a “conversational AI service.” If that sounds familiar, you’ve likely encountered
    one of the many online influencers talking about ChatGPT in the past few months.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Opinions vary widely about this AI breakthrough. Those in favor discuss revolutionary
    plans or share excitement to leverage the chatbot to grow a business quickly.
    One of the most popular use cases for ChatGPT is the chance to automate repetitive
    tasks. On the other hand, critics have expressed flawed views about its abilities
    — thinking the chatbot’s functionality replaces human research and critical thinking.
    Google Bard will spark similar conversations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google’s Bard is based on [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/),
    a language model the company rolled out in 2021, which itself is built on the
    company’s popular open-source neural network architecture, [Transformer](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformer-neural-network-step-by-step-breakdown-of-the-beast-b3e096dc857f).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interestingly, LaMDA was trained using dialogue, allowing it to learn how to
    respond to human conversations more naturally than previous language models. (If
    the name LaMDA sounds familiar, maybe you recall when a Google engineer believed
    [LaMDA had become sentient](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-engineer-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient-why-that-matters/).)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Announced in May of 2021, Google’s LaMDA debut was a chance to discuss the benefits
    of their model, with the announcement specifically focused on the factuality of
    its responses. Two years later, during the Bard announcement, reporters quickly
    discovered a factual error. What will this mean for Google’s implementation? We
    will have to wait and see.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given how similar the two sound, some have asked, what makes this new product
    different? Google modestly claims its new service adds the “breadth of the world’s
    knowledge” to LaMDA’s already-impressive conversational skills. It also promises
    to advance the model’s capabilities to offer more guidance and research than an
    ordinary chatbot. In short, Bard relies on LaMDA. LaMDA doesn’t rely on Bard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also note that Google plans to open the service up to developers via the Bard
    API link, making it more exciting than a regular chatbot. And while users can
    already drive free-flowing conversations with LaMDA, Google Bard promises to elevate
    the conversation by including the same information the company provides with its
    omnipresent Google Search service.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Counterintuitively, Bard’s factual misstep shouldn’t undercut the promised value
    of this new service. Google’s search results never promised absolute accuracy.
    Searchers should always consider their sources. That fact remains, even with the
    release of an impressive chatbot.

    the use of penalties for any party that breaks a promise. It’s encouraging to
    see teams focused on building AI strategies that promote trustworthy communication,
    but consider what that means for unwary data scientists.

    Like their human counterparts, conversational chatbots regularly show confirmation

    issues, but we should anticipate flaws from the newest third-party applications

    no data set ever represents the full truth. Deep learning may help provide more

    no chatbot is God.

    . . there is no need to ask the question ‘Is the model true?’. If ‘truth’ is to
    be the ‘whole truth’, the answer must be ‘No’. The only question of interest is
    ‘Is the model illuminating and useful?’”.
