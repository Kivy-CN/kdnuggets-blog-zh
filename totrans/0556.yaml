- en: Being a senior data scientists is treated as a holy grail, though many do not
    know what it really means to hold a senior position. The most common impression
    is that being a senior data scientist means that you know everything there is
    to know about data science and you are truly an expert in it. Which is true, but
    only to a certain extent because learning in data science never ends. Moreover,
    there is so much more to being a senior data scientist than just technical knowledge.

    important to know the standard path data scientists follow so that you can make
    smarter decisions about which side of this path you want to be. Simply, the more
    informed you are, the easier it will be to choose your side when deciding between
    two companies, two positions or two projects.

    science knowledge. Your capability should be enough to conduct your tasks alone
    or with help from your more senior colleagues. At this point in time, you will
    not have much professional hands-on experience.

    More senior colleagues will be happy to help you along with your learning. It
    would not be surprising if you learned something new every day as a junior data
    scientist.

    get assistance from more senior data scientists when you encounter problems. Apart
    from your technical capabilities, you will be expected to have a good understanding
    of the parts of the domain that is related to your specific tasks.

    must be solid. Though it doesn’t mean that you already know everything. Rather,
    it means that you know many things and you also know what you don’t know. You
    probably have already gained some good practical experience at this level.

    ask a lot of questions but you also get asked questions from others. Junior colleagues
    come to you with their questions. You still learn new things, maybe not every
    day but every other month. You try to go deeper in our understanding of certain
    techniques and tools.

    process but you lead it. The success of the project is your responsibility, as
    well as, in many cases, the happiness of your team members. While leading the
    project you also need to communicate with the outside world. It is your responsibility
    to report to the business side. You need to keep non-technical constraints in
    mind while working on the project and make sure to nudge the technical team in
    the right direction. You have to have an overall and complete understanding of
    the context and the domain. It is your responsibility to stay on target and deliver.

    company in the world. Also, you might be a freelance data scientist or you might
    start your company and become a CTO, then your path would look very different.
    But in general, from what I’ve learned talking to people in the data science community,
    this is a good representation of a general data scientist career path.

- en: The reason we looked into this today is that every company has its own structure,
    own rules and own pathways and you want to know which one to choose when you get
    the option. Some will tend towards more technical work as you get more senior
    and some towards more managerial and administrative work. You can use the explanation
    in this article as a baseline to figure out where you want to be at the senior
    part of your journey and calibrate your job search accordingly. Of course, plans
    and preferences change in time. But having an idea of where you want to end up
    is better than going into it blindly.

    build a project in your hands you can be proud of.
