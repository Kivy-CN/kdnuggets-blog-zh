- en: While the "Trail Blazers" (Google, Amazon, Facebook, ...) and "Early Assimilators"
    companies were reaping substantial benefits through wide spread institutionalization,
    there were this large pool of organisations ("Masses") who were at the fringes
    watching closely. The big trend I see emerging for 2017 and forward, is the increasing
    adoption of data science as a practice among the "Masses". Adoption of data science
    domain within these companies are relatively at a smaller scale, as Proof of Concept
    projects , to figure out what Data Science can do for them. Lot of these organisations
    are seeing early successes with their small projects and are at the cusp of institutionalizing
    their early gains. From the conversations we have had with many customers, come
    2017 we might witness the explosion of data science as a domain within the Masses.

- en: The large blow-up in data science (in failing to predict 2016 US presidential
    election) has come from the use of social media information to provide accurate
    facts from all of the information they share. From a company level (e.g., Facebook
    video metrics or their censoring tools in China) to the individuals having noisy
    data consumed (e.g., Reddit comments edited, or fake twitter news), it is clear
    that post-election there is far more scrutiny on how information can be judged
    to be valuable and reliable. And whether the large technology companies can be
    independently trusted to set differentiated rules evenly for everyone.

    at stake some companies have decided to take a more analytical and even predictive
    approach but unfortunately not enough. Using workforce metrics to solve business
    problems will make a stand in 2017\. Those who jump on board will see almost immediate
    results but those that continue to follow the old HR methods, turnover will continue
    to plague!

- en: Businesses have relied on Industrial and Organizational (Ind/Org) Psychologists
    to apply science to workplace issues. Much of this work involves creating tests,
    surveys, training courses, selection procedures and the like. Until recently,
    Ind/Org Psychology has shown a deductive, purely statistical mindset - more chi-square,
    less AUC. This rigor is good, and sometimes Data Science could use more of it.

    machine learning](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/present-future-talent-analytics-seen-from-lec2016-levi-nieminen)
    and inductive methods of modern Data Science. This will be a fascinating fusion
    of mindsets, and we expect to see it begin to blossom in 2017.

    in 2016 US election (as well as a similar failure to predict Brexit) was a reminder
    to the limits of Data Science and predictions when dealing with small data, human
    behavior, and implicit biases. I expect more Deep Learning successes in data-rich
    domains in 2017, and hope that Data Scientists have learned the lessons from failure
    to predict Trump.

    and organizations who are new to the idea of predictive analytics may be more
    suspicious of our industry than they have previously. The magnitude, extent, and
    publicity around the missed election predictions may require us to work harder
    to prove our value to those outside the community.

    victory over Clinton. Nate Silver's success in predicting Obama's presidential
    election (including every state) over the 2008 and 2012 elections set us up for
    a big fall. Nate missed the election (giving Clinton a 70% chance of winning the
    morning of the election) and missed on 9 states. Stunning. There is tons to learn
    that we can apply to all industries and organizations (e.g., Analytics Half-life
    syndrome, Importance of constantly looking for customer and market sentiment proxies,
    harnessing analytic modeling paranoia).

- en: The consequence of this focus on analytic technology is that a key trend for
    2017 is going to be fixing the analytic value chain - moving the focus away from
    how "good a model can we build" to "how can we improve the business with analytics".
    This means investing in developing business understanding, using decision modeling
    for instance, and in deployment of analytic models into production systems (with
    all the associated organizational change).
