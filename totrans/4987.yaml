    concepts. In this overview, we provide the definitions and intuition behind several
    types of correlation and illustrate how to calculate correlation using the Python
    `pandas` library.

- en: The term "correlation" refers to a mutual relationship or association between
    quantities. In almost any business, it is useful to express one quantity in terms
    of its relationship with others. For example, sales might increase when the [marketing
    department spends](https://www.datascience.com/blog/data-science-and-predictive-modeling-for-marketers)
    more on TV advertisements, or a [customer's average purchase amount](https://www.datascience.com/blog/capturing-better-customers-with-lifetime-value-modeling)
    on an e-commerce website might depend on a number of factors related to that customer.
    Often, correlation is the first step to understanding these relationships and
    subsequently building better business and statistical models.

    between random variables. There are several methods for calculating the correlation
    coefficient, each measuring different types of strength of association. Below
    we summarize three of the most widely used methods.

    to introduce the concept of *covariance*. Covariance is a statistical measure
    of association between two variables *X* and *Y*. First, each variable is centered
    by subtracting its mean. These centered scores are multiplied together to measure
    whether the increase in one variable associates with the increase in another.
    Finally, expected value (*E*) of the product of these centered scores is calculated
    as a summary of association. Intuitively, the product of centered scores can be
    thought of as the area of a rectangle with each point''s distance from the mean
    describing a side of the rectangle:'

    rectangle connecting each point (X_i, Y_i) to the means (X_bar, Y_bar) to have
    a large and positive diagonal vector, corresponding to a larger positive product
    in the equation above. If both variables tend to move in opposite directions,
    we expect the average rectangle to have a diagonal vector that is large and negative,
    corresponding to a larger negative product in the equation above. If the variables
    are unrelated, then the vectors should, on average, cancel out — and the total
    diagonal vector should have a magnitude near 0, corresponding to a product near
    0 in the equation above.

    the average, or mean *μ,* of a random variable. It is also referred to as "expectation."
    In other words, we can write the following equation to express the same quantity
    in a different way:'

- en: The problem with covariance is that it keeps the scale of the variables *X* and *Y,* and
    therefore can take on any value. This makes interpretation difficult and comparing
    covariances to each other impossible. For example, *Cov*(*X*, *Y*)  = 5.2 and *Cov*(*Z*,
    *Q*) = 3.1 tell us that these pairs are positively associated, but it is difficult
    to tell whether the relationship between *X* and *Y* is stronger than *Z* and
    *Q* without looking at the means and distributions of these variables. This is
    where correlation becomes useful — by standardizing covariance by some measure
    of variability in the data, it produces a quantity that has intuitive interpretations
    and consistent scale.

- en: Pearson is the most widely used correlation coefficient. Pearson correlation
    measures the linear association between continuous variables. In other words,
    this coefficient quantifies the degree to which a relationship between two variables
    can be described by a line. Remarkably, while correlation can have many interpretations,
    the same formula developed by Karl Pearson over 120 years ago is still the most
    widely used today.

    of covariance, since mean and expectation can be used interchangeably. Dividing
    the covariance between two variables by the product of standard deviations ensures
    that correlation will always fall between -1 and 1\. This makes interpreting the
    correlation coefficient much easier.

- en: The figure below shows three examples of Pearson correlation. The closer *ρ* is
    to 1, the more an increase in one variable associates with an increase in the
    other. On the other hand, the closer *ρ* is to -1, the increase in one variable
    would result in decrease in the other. Note that if *X* and *Y* are independent,
    then *ρ* is close to 0, but not vice versa! In other words, Pearson correlation
    can be small even if there is a strong relationship between two variables. We
    will see shortly how this can be the case.
