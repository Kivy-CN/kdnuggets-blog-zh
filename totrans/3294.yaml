    TensorFlow, and clusters of powerful GPU’s are combining to produce powerful systems
    that can do things like [beat the world’s best Go player.](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/googles-alphago-continues-dominance-second-win-china/)

    the unintended consequences of well-meaning machine learning research.

    for the past seven years. You know, the recommender systems that sell you stuff
    you never knew existed based on your past interests and purchases, and generate
    a sizable percentage of Amazon’s revenue.

    He warned us that too much personalization could leave people in a bubble that
    just keeps reinforcing the same interests and beliefs. This talk proved prophetic;
    today there’s much debate about the role filter bubbles in social media played
    in polarizing our modern society, and the role it’s played in politics.

    intended to help you discover new books and music could have that sort of an impact
    on society, I thought. But I was wrong. I still manage to sleep at night because
    Eli’s concern was personalization at Facebook and Google, not at Amazon – but
    I still feel a little bit complicit, as Amazon was a pioneer in this field.

    intelligence that we once had over personalization. There’s a lot of excitement
    as we build self-driving cars that actually work, or outsmart humans at games
    they said machines could never master. But these technologies also have unintended
    consequences. Set aside the speculation about the “singularity” – today, what
    would happen if a cyber-terrorist got his hands on the system you’re building?
    Could your neural network be trained to, say, break into weapons control systems
    or power grids? Just as I never foresaw algorithms built to find new science-fiction
    books for me influencing world politics, you might not foresee the technology
    you’re creating playing a role in a civilization-threatening attack.

    good? Well, no. It would also be wrong to stop the advancement of technology.
    But there are decisions we can make to try and keep the technology we develop
    in the right hands. Even though my business today is [inexpensive online training
    in machine learning](http://www.sundog-education.com/), I’ve considered not producing
    courses on AI at all, because perhaps that sort of knowledge shouldn’t be easy
    for bad guys to obtain. Maybe you should think twice about how much information
    you give out at conferences, or in open source form. That cool graphical tool
    you're building that lets anyone set up a neural network on a cluster for any
    purpose they want? Maybe that's really not such a great thing to unleash upon
    the public.

    with AI kill people.” But do you really want to end up second-guessing the role
    you played in the next big AI-powered cyber-attack in a few years? I’ve been there,
    in a way, and it’s not fun.
