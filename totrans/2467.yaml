    problems. We will see how a simple logistic regression problem is solved using
    optimization based on gradient descent, which is one of the most popular optimization

    regression requires the dependent variable to be ordinal.*   The observation should
    not come from repeated measurements or matched data.*   Logistic regression rejects
    multicollinearity among the independent variables.*   It works on assumption of
    independent linearity. It requires that the independent variables linearly related
    to the log odds.

    as you want. However, be aware that you won’t be able to visualize the results

    logistic function. It is also called the sigmoid function. It is used to describe
    properties of population growth in ecology, rising quickly and maxing out at the
    carrying capacity of the environment. It's a three shape curve that can take any
    value number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those
    limits.

- en: Logistic regression is one of the traditional machine learning methods. It forms
    a foundational set of ML approaches alongside algorithms such as linear regression,
    k-suggest clustering, major component analysis, and a few others. Neural networks
    have been developed leveraging logistic regression. You can efficiently use logistic
    regression even if you are not an ML specialist, not the case with many other
    algorithms. Conversely, it is not possible to become an ML master without a solif
    understanding of logistic regression.
