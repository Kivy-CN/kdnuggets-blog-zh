    a wonderful, **magical world** full of algorithms, **Python **functions that performs
    every possible spell with **a line of code** and statistical models able to detect
    the most useful **correlations **among data that could make you an invincible **superhero **in
    your company. You start dreaming about your CEO congratulating with you and shaking
    your hand, you begin to see **decision trees** and **clusters** everywhere and,

    a result **can’t be reached**. Think about **clustering**, for example. You can
    spend an entire life searching for a clustering pattern that simply doesn’t exist
    in your data. Most managers don’t understand this fact, and it can be **very stressful **for
    you and your team.

    Never forget this. No sane manager in the world would follow an unknown algorithm
    for managing their company’s money only because its AUROC is greater than 95%.
    Managers **need to understand** algorithms, figure out how they **think **about
    data, and this is often a great task for a Data Scientist. Explaining algorithms
    to somebody with no scientific background can be quite difficult, but it’s **very

    Instead, some **Agile framework **(e.g., Scrum or Kanban) should work well, due
    to its physiological ability to quickly **adapt to changes**. But Agile is difficult

- en: According to my experience, I can answer with a single word: **Agile**. There’s
    no need to perform all the business understanding part before writing your first
    Python code line. Start with a **simple business understanding **of a small piece
    of data, explore it, **visualize it,  **and begin with a **simple model**. Create
    the first, quantifiable results **week by week **keeping your **customers constantly
    engaged **in the process. Deliver **small results **with a **constant delivery
    rate **and, please, don’t fall into the waterfall trap.

    this is another weapon you have to use if you want to survive in the jungle of
    companies’ deadlines and business processes. In this way, every colleague of yours
    who is committed to your project will **feel your difficulties **and start to
    understand how difficult Data Science is.

    are not completely wrong, but they shouldn’t expect you to follow the waterfall
    approach. So, you have to suffer the struggle to guide your company toward an **Agile
    way of thinking**.

    machine learning model **possible: **k-nearest neighbors**. It’s very easy to
    understand. You only need paper, a pencil and a Cartesian plane with some points
    drawn on it. That’s it. If it produces very nice results, everybody will finally
    see you like the great business partner you think you are.

    forests, gradient boosted tree classifiers, and so on), which are very easy to
    explain, or **Bayesian networks**, which have a very useful graphical representation.

    in data visualization**, learn as much as possible about the best visualization
    techniques, and, please, remember to **avoid pie charts**. They are pretty useless
    and misleading. If you provide a simple **scatter **or **bar plot**, people will
    catch all the relevant information.

    Our audience was enthusiastic since the first slide, only because we started with
    clear numbers explaining the business in a simple way. In many situations, a **small
    building block** can really save your life.'

- en: Data Science is an exciting job, but it can be very difficult to perform if
    you speak to a non-technical audience. Data and business are intimately related
    to each other, and you must remember this point when you work with business-oriented
    people. The only way to survive is to **find a middle point **between a **data-driven** bottom-up
    approach and a **business-driven** top-down approach.
