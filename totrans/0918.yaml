  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Selection bias is a type of bias that occurs when a sample of individuals is
    not selected randomly and therefore does not accurately represent the population
    it is supposed to represent. This can happen in many ways, such as by selecting
    individuals based on certain characteristics, only recruiting participants from
    a certain area, or only including individuals who meet certain criteria.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Selection bias is important because it can lead to inaccurate conclusions and
    flawed research findings. If a sample is not representative of the population,
    any inferences or conclusions drawn from the sample may not apply to the population
    as a whole.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To avoid selection bias, researchers should use random sampling techniques when
    selecting participants for a study. This can be done by using a random number
    generator to select participants, or by using a stratified random sampling approach
    that takes into account certain characteristics of the population. Additionally,
    researchers should ensure that their recruitment strategies are not biased and
    that participants are not excluded from the study on the basis of certain characteristics.
    Researchers should also report their sampling method in detail in the paper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    potential bias in the sample, when analyzing the data.

    question about user behavior.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One example of how experimental design can be used to answer a question about
    user behavior is through a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say the question is "Does a new feature on a website increase user engagement?"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'An experimental design would be to randomly divide the website''s users into
    two groups: a control group and an experimental group. The control group would
    continue to use the website as usual, while the experimental group would have
    access to the new feature.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The researcher would then measure user engagement (e.g. time spent on the website,
    number of pages visited, number of interactions with the new feature) for both
    groups over a set period of time. By comparing the engagement data of the two
    groups, the researcher can determine if the new feature has a significant impact
    on user engagement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By using random assignment to form the two groups, we can be sure that any differences
    observed between the two groups are due to the new feature and not to other factors.
    Additionally, by using a control group, we can be sure that any differences observed
    are not due to chance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This experimental design allows for a causal inference, meaning that the researcher
    can infer that the new feature caused the change in user engagement, rather than
    just observing a correlation.

    several columns that represent different variables, such as the subject ID, the
    variable of interest and the value of that variable. This format is also known
    as "stacked" or "melted" data.

    of data, "long" format data is organized by observations and variables, while
    "wide" format data is organized by observations and variables of interest. Some
    data analysis and visualization methods may be more suitable for one format over
    the other, and it is not uncommon to convert between the two formats depending
    on the analysis needs.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Edward Tufte is a statistician and information designer who has written several
    influential books on data visualization. One of his key concepts is "chart junk,"
    which refers to the use of non-informative or redundant elements in data visualizations
    that detract from the message being conveyed. These elements can include things
    like gridlines, decorative borders, 3D effects, and unnecessary text. Tufte argues
    that chart junk can make it more difficult for viewers to understand the information
    being presented, and can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tufte's main argument is that the main goal of data visualization is to present
    the information clearly and accurately, and that chart junk can be a distraction
    from this goal. He argues that good data visualization should prioritize the data
    itself, making it easy to read and understand, and that any additional elements
    should be used sparingly and only if they serve a clear purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He also emphasizes that data visualization should be simple, clear, and focus
    on the data and its message, rather than on the design. In his view, effective
    data visualizations should be able to stand alone, without the need for additional
    text or annotations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and continue to be widely referenced and applied in areas such as business, data
    science and journalism.

    or mathematical statistics (or anything else) to correctly estimate the chance
    of a very rare event?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Extreme Value Theory (EVT) can be used to estimate the probability of rare events
    by modeling the extreme tails of a probability distribution. This can be done
    by fitting a distribution, such as the Gumbel or Generalized Pareto distribution,
    to the extreme values of a dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Monte Carlo simulations can also be used to estimate the probability of a rare
    event by generating many random samples from a probability distribution and counting
    the number of times the event of interest occurs. This can be useful when the
    underlying distribution is complex or unknown.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mathematical statistics can be used to estimate the probability of a rare event
    by using methods such as maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian inference.
    These methods use mathematical models and algorithms to estimate the probability
    of an event based on the available data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A recommendation engine is a system that uses machine learning algorithms to
    recommend items to users based on their past behavior and preferences. It is often
    used in e-commerce, media and entertainment, and social media to provide personalized
    recommendations to users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are two main types of recommendation engines: content-based and collaborative
    filtering.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Content-based recommendation engines use the characteristics or attributes of
    the items to recommend similar items to a user. For example, if a user likes movies
    with a certain actor, the engine might recommend other movies with that actor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Collaborative filtering, on the other hand, uses the behavior of users to recommend
    items. It looks at the interactions of users with items, such as rating or purchasing
    history, and finds similar users to recommend items that they liked. There are
    two types of collaborative filtering: user-based and item-based. User-based CF
    recommends items to a user based on their similarity to other users, item-based
    CF recommends items based on their similarity to the items a user has previously
    interacted with.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both types of recommendation engines use machine learning algorithms, such as
    k-NN, SVD, and matrix factorization, to analyze the data and make recommendations.
    They also use techniques like regularization and cross-validation to avoid overfitting
    of the models.
  prefs: []

    to make personalized recommendations for each user. They are widely used in different
    industries and help to increase user engagement and sales.

    to differentiate these from each other?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A false positive is a situation where a test result indicates that a particular
    condition is present when it is actually not. For example, in medical testing,
    a false positive would occur if a patient is told they have a certain disease
    when they do not actually have it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A false negative, on the other hand, is a situation where a test result indicates
    that a particular condition is not present when it actually is. For example, a
    false negative in medical testing would occur if a patient is told they do not
    have a certain disease when they actually do have it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to differentiate between false positives and false negatives
    because they have different implications. A false positive could lead to unnecessary
    treatments, procedures, or further testing, while a false negative could result
    in a delay or failure in diagnosis and treatment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the field of machine learning, the difference between false positive and
    false negative is also important. The false positive rate and false negative rate
    are two commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of a classifier, which
    can help to understand the trade-off between accuracy and recall. For example,
    in a medical diagnosis problem, if the false negative rate is too high, it means
    that many patients with the disease will be misdiagnosed, which can lead to serious
    consequences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    positives and false negatives, depending on the stakes of the problem, the costs
    of each type of error, and the desired level of confidence in the results.
