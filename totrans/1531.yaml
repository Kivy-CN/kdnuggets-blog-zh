    for ranks 1-50. They provide individual CS rankings for top 50 schools, and then
    ranges (51-100, 101-150, etc) for the next 450 schools. To separate schools that
    have the same range of rankings, we added the Top Universities ranking for the
    divided by 10 to the start of the range. Of course, this ranking isn’t 100% scientific
