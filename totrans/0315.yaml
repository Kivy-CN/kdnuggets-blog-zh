    of variables that could affect where we end up on the career landscape, some within
    our control and some without. But the better we understand the context and requirements
    for each role, the better we can begin to plan and take advantage of the right
    opportunities when they arise.

- en: The classes are organized according to similar job activities and deliverables.
    Individual contributor roles are at the top, with management and executive roles
    towards the bottom. Then each role is color coded according to a track, depending
    on the level of business or technical focus involved. Some classes, such as Analyze,
    consist of multiple color tracks, while others like Sell or Configure are focused
    on a single color. The roles in the center are involved with coordination and
    planning for multiple classes. The roles are generally organized with lowest seniority
    on top and increasing seniority toward the bottom, but each role may have many
    levels of seniority at some organization, such as Data Engineer Level 1 to Data
    Engineer Level 5\. And each of these roles may vary depending on the organization.

    your location and the neighboring roles. A Business Analyst, for example, may
    be creating presentations and using software to gather data. The Research Analyst
    and Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst roles are within the next steps as the
    analyst gains more business or technical skills. Transitioning to a new role anywhere
    on the landscape is theoretically possible, but the most common steps will be
    within one or two steps or in an adjacent class.

- en: The “Configure” job class may not be familiar to many people who are new to
    the field. The roles might have names like “Salesforce Developer”, “SAP ABAP Developer,
    or “NetSuite Configuration Consultant”.  In the Enterprise IT world, these roles
    are common and well-paying. But in college programs these roles are rarely mentioned
    because they involve specific software packages and are constantly evolving. 
    Platforms like Salesforce allow companies to build new applications with a combination
    of low-code and full-code environments. This job class is constantly hiring at
    consulting firms and vendor implementation groups.

- en: Many of the most interesting data roles span more than one class. Data Scientist,
    for example, is a blend of analysis and developer skills. Dev/ML Ops will blend
    software configuration and support roles. These cross-class roles also tend to
    be the most sought-after and highest paid due to the multiple skillsets involved.
    Many people claim to be truly cross-functional unicorns, but not everyone can
    perform the wide variety of skills involved.

- en: These migration paths are where typical career advancement might occur but are
    not intended to be exhaustive. The general movement pattern is from top to bottom
    as you gain seniority and may perhaps feel burned out from previous roles. These
    migration patterns are important to recognize because they may explain why you
    are not getting responses to job applications! An experienced Project Manager,
    for example, may not get many responses to a job application as a Salesforce Developer
    (Software Configuration) because it is a rare combination. But a Software Engineer
    transitioning to a Systems Architect role will be a natural step and will surprise
    no one.

- en: 'A crucial question in the migration patterns is: what happens when you reach
    a Sales, Management or Executive role and decide you want to go back? There are
    few arrows going in the opposite direction. These roles lower on the chart tend
    to have less technical deliverables and may cause skills to atrophy. And the pay
    is usually lower if you go back. Three great options for people who may be tired
    of Managing or Selling are to do consulting, teaching or start a company. While
    there may be a scarcity of executive roles in large companies, there is an unlimited
    supply at the next batch of startup companies!'

    that I published in a previous post. As you look through the roadmap, you can
    decide which type of track appeals to you most. A technical track can easily transition
    to hybrid, but a business track is not so easy to transition due to the coding
    skills required.

- en: Don’t worry if you don’t know what you want to do in 10 years. Very few of us
    do. You can focus on evaluating where you are on the data career landscape, and
    identifying roles that look appealing for the future. If you don’t recognize any
    of the roles on the map, take some time to learn about them and you might find
    some interesting ideas. If you see an attractive role that is not within your
    reach, then you can go back to school to make the transition. The good news is
    that there is an abundance of opportunities in the data field and the industry
    is growing faster each year.
