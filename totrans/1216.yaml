    a great way to learn about the rock stars and superheroes of the AI world. You
    get a glimpse of how they think, what they are working on, and how they solved
    a particular problem.

    sets this podcast apart from the others. Hanna Fry is a Mathematician and has
    had experience in hosting podcasts. She is passionate and knowledgeable about
    AI and passionate about this podcast. This podcast likely has a team working behind
    it, and the sound effects and the music tells us so. They also make the experience

- en: Lex Fridman is an AI researcher working on autonomous vehicles and human-robot
    interaction. He also teaches at MIT. The way he is unique as a podcast host is
    that he is very focused on long-term goals and far-reaching implications of the
    works of the guests. He is interested in deep things such as consciousness and
    the idea of AGI. He asks deep, fundamental questions and lets us know about the
    guests’ views on these questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The topics on his podcast transcend the AI universe. He has had guests like
    Roger Penrose, Richard Dawkins, and Noam Chomsky. A significant portion of his
    interviews *is* on AI. His interviews are generally long and hence have much more
    scope to discuss topics in an in-depth, detailed manner. I really like that.

    writes blogs, hosts interviews, and hosts book-reading clubs and other clubs with
    Machine Learning Tokyo. He is also very active in the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai/) Communities.
    And he never monetizes his content! When he is interviewing guests on his podcast,
    he is not asking questions for the interview but for learning, too! I like his
    inquisitive, humble manner of asking questions.

    talks about the guests’ journey, career, and current research, projects, and interests.
    And then there is Kaggle! He often interviews winners of particular competitions
    and asks about their thinking and approach to those particular competitions. These
    are really informative for people competing on Kaggle or interested in developing
    full pipelines for any project. It is very interesting to see the diverse set
    of people from diverse backgrounds win Kaggle competitions, and talk about their
    careers, lives, and Kaggle on this podcast.

    them. That is evident from their choice of backgrounds, style of presentation,
    and many more things. They delve deep into research topics and interview the person(s)
    attached to them. The fact that there is more than one host adds value to the
    conversations rather than being a liability. The listeners get to hear from multiple
    perspectives and get acquainted with multiple views. The guests are also much
    more likely to shed light on different aspects of the research.

    together as one because all of the content present at the first two resources
    are not focused on ML or AI. And although TED has a few talks based on this topic
    and broader topics, it has some really good talks on ML, Data Science, and AI.

    listening to the talk, [Making data mean more through storytelling | Ben Wellington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsvGYIxJok),
    which was given back in 2015 that highlights how creative yet simple Data Analysis
    can reveal many important insights and how it can make lives better by influencing
    government policies. There’s another talk that I will mention: [Daphne Koller:
    What we’re learning from online education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FvJ6jMGHU).
    The co-founder of Coursera gives us many deep insights about online education
    and how data are at the core and crux of it. This is yet another example of data
    transforming something fundamental like education and impacting the lives of millions
    positively.'
