    being coined in 2008 by Jeff Hammerbacher and DJ Patil.

    4 years running (according to sources like the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) and [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm) report).
    But KDnuggets readers know all that very well. In fact, that may be one of the
    reasons why we all keep coming back here.

    skill set needed to become part of this lucrative career. [That’s why, last year,
    we performed a study of 1,001 LinkedIn profiles to build a picture of the ‘typical’
    data scientist.](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/12/research-1001-data-scientist-profiles.html)
    The results were, in a way, confirmatory of other studies and polls, such as the
    yearly [KDnuggets Software Poll](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html),
    but also shed some light on other interesting aspects of what makes a data scientist…

    Unlike other methods of gathering data, such as job ads, we believe that data
    posted by the professionals themselves are a good proxy of their actual resumes.

    40% of our profiles from Fortune 500 companies and 60% from elsewhere. Our country
    quotas were also the same, 40% from the USA, 30% from the UK, 15% from India,
    and another 15% from other countries. Convenience sampling was employed due to
    data accessibility limitations.

    only 1% since last year (69% in 2019 – 70% in 2018); three quarters of our cohort
    have a master’s or PhD (again, negligibly decreasing); and the average experience
    in the role has risen just 0.3 years from 2 to 2.3.

    had been in the workforce for 4.5 years, while today that number is 8 years. This
    implies more people are switching careers at an older age or what we deem more
    probable – statisticians, ‘data miners’, econometricians, and others have evolved
    (likely acquiring new skills, too) and embraced the new name of their profession:
    data scientist. In fact we’ve looked into the naming conventions in the field
    before, and you can find a [detailed overview here.](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/what-where-how-data-science.html)'

    that, just like last year, it is programming languages that are found most in
    a data scientists toolkit (as opposed to software, such as Tableau or SAS).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is still R and Python that are leading the pack, but while both sat equally
    in 2018, with 53% of data scientists boasting either skill, Python is now leaving
    R in the dust (or as [Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro put it – Python continues to eat
    away at R](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html)).
    54% of our cohort put Python as one of their top skills and only 45% mention R.

    from last year). The last 3 languages in the top 6 haven’t changed from 2018.MATLAB
    and Java users even equal those of last year (19% and 18% respectively), however,
    we do observe a significant 10% drop for C/C++ programmers (18% to 8%).
  prefs: []

- en: Finally, last year we looked at the skill set by industry, so it makes sense
    to replicate this analysis, too. In terms of distribution of languages across
    industry, we observe very similar results to the 2018 trends. The main take-away
    is that even in this segmentation the results essentially mirror what we see as
    an overall preference – Python is dominating all industries.

    increasing 1% since last year (43% in 2019 – 42% in 2018). However, while tech
    is still reigning, data scientists in the industrial sector are also increasing,
    rising from 37% to 39%. The financial sector is unchanged at 16%, while the healthcare
    industry went from employing 5% of data scientists, to a tiny 2% (certainly it
    is worth noting that Healthcare is an insignificantly small group compared to
    the others, so this drop may be completely attributed to sampling limitations).

    aside from the UK which favours the finance industry more than the other countries.Even
    with the unclear future of London as the financial center of Europe, financial
    institutions in the UK seem to be heavily invested in data science.

    the number of data scientists in their tech industry from a massive 63% to a more
    average 47%. Some of these have gone across to the industrial sector, that now
    hires 30% of India’s data scientists, up from 21.4%. But it looks like India has
    taken a page out of the UK’s book, as their financial industry has gained a whopping
    13% more data scientists (8.3% in 2018 – 21% in 2019). It is no secret that India
    has dominated the tech world with many companies outsourcing and data science
    is following suit. Continuing to follow the developments of the field in India
    is surely something we are looking forward to.

- en: This replicated study has reiterated what it takes to become a data scientist.
    The programming languages required for a data scientist appear clearer than ever,
    with the gap between Python and R continuing to expand. This is yet another ‘check’
    for aspiring data scientists, helping them to choose wisely which skills to focus
    on, depending on the country and industry you intend to work in.

    a researcher wants, but they are indeed a confirmation of the trends that are
    already taking place. As data science is standing stronger than ever, we expect
    to see more stability and less surprises in the data scientist profile. While
    far away from a mature field, data science is still evolving and keeping up with
    tends and patterns is as important as ever.
