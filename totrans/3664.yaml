- en: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the
    field, equipping them with new capabilities like natural dialogue, mathematical
    reasoning, and program synthesis. However, LLMs still face inherent limitations.
    Their ability to store information is constrained by fixed weights, and their
    computation capabilities are limited to a static graph and narrow context. Additionally,
    as the world evolves, LLMs need retraining to update their knowledge and reasoning
    abilities. To overcome these limitations, researchers have started empowering
    LLMs with tools. By granting access to extensive and dynamic knowledge bases and
    enabling complex computational tasks, LLMs can leverage search technologies, databases,
    and computational tools. Leading LLM providers have begun integrating plugins
    that allow LLMs to invoke external tools through APIs. This transition from a
    limited set of hand-coded tools to accessing a vast array of cloud APIs has the
    potential to transform LLMs into the primary interface for computing infrastructure
    and the web. Tasks such as booking vacations or hosting conferences could be as
    simple as conversing with an LLM that has access to flight, car rental, hotel,
    catering, and entertainment web APIs.

- en: Recently, researchers from UC Berkeley and Microsoft unveiled [Gorilla](https://shishirpatil.github.io/gorilla/),
    a LLaMA-7B model designed specifically for API calls. Gorilla relies on self-instruct
    fine-tuning and retrieval techniques to enable LLMs to select accurately from
    a large and evolving set of tools expressed through their APIs and documentation.
    The authors construct a large corpus of APIs, called APIBench, by scraping machine
    learning APIs from major model hubs such as TorchHub, TensorHub, and HuggingFace.
    Using self-instruct, they generate pairs of instructions and corresponding APIs.
    The fine-tuning process involves converting the data to a user-agent chat-style
    conversation format and performing standard instruction finetuning on the base
    LLaMA-7B model.

    and categorization of the calls. For example, a prompt may require invoking an
    image classification model with specific parameter size and accuracy constraints. These
    challenges highlight the need for LLMs to understand not only the functional description
    of an API call but also reason about the embedded constraints.

    Hub, Tensor Hub, and HuggingFace. Each domain contributes a wealth of information,
    shedding light on the diverse nature of the dataset. Torch Hub, for instance,
    offers 95 APIs, providing a solid foundation. In comparison, Tensor Hub takes
    it a step further with an extensive collection of 696 APIs. Lastly, HuggingFace
    leads the pack with a whopping 925 APIs, making it the most comprehensive domain.'

    been undertaken. Each API in the dataset is accompanied by a set of 10 meticulously
    crafted and uniquely tailored instructions. These instructions serve as indispensable
    guides for both training and evaluation purposes. This initiative ensures that
    every API goes beyond mere representation, enabling more robust utilization and
    analysis.

    dataset includes an additional field with retrieved API documentation for reference.
    This approach aims to teach the LLM to parse and answer questions based on the
    provided documentation. The authors demonstrate that this technique allows the
    LLM to adapt to changes in API documentation, improves performance, and reduces
    hallucination errors.

    in two modes: zero-shot and retrieval. In zero-shot mode, the prompt is directly
    fed to the Gorilla LLM model, which returns the recommended API call to accomplish
    the task or goal. In retrieval mode, the retriever (either BM25 or GPT-Index)
    retrieves the most up-to-date API documentation from the API Database. This documentation
    is concatenated with the user prompt, along with a message indicating the reference
    to the API documentation. The concatenated input is then passed to Gorilla, which
    outputs the API to be invoked. Prompt tuning is not performed beyond the concatenation
    step in this system.'

    programs that meet specific test cases. However, when it comes to evaluating API
    calls, relying solely on test cases falls short as it becomes challenging to verify
    the semantic correctness of the code. Let’s consider the example of image classification,
    where there are more than 40 different models available for the task. Even if
    we narrow it down to a specific family, such as Densenet, there are four possible
    configurations. Consequently, multiple correct answers exist, making it difficult
    to determine if the API being used is functionally equivalent to the reference
    API through unit tests. To evaluate the performance of the model, a comparison
    of their functional equivalence is made using the collected dataset. To identify
    the API called by the LLM in the dataset, an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) tree-matching
    strategy is employed. By checking if the AST of a candidate API call is a sub-tree
    of the reference API call, it becomes possible to trace which API is being utilized.

    matching process is leveraged to identify hallucinations directly. In this context,
    a hallucination refers to an API call that is not a sub-tree of any API in the
    database, essentially invoking an entirely imagined tool. It’s important to note
    that this definition of hallucination differs from invoking an API incorrectly,
    which is defined as an error.

    called within the dataset. Since API calls can have multiple arguments, each of
    these arguments needs to be matched. Additionally, considering that Python allows
    for default arguments, it is essential to define which arguments to match for
    each API in the database.
