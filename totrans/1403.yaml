    that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics
    itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box.
    In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box
    – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial
    way of thinking.

    power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific
    literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve
    analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory
    construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies,
    why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following
    Open Science principles.
