    contributed to the decision? On the one hand, if you are denied something by the
    algorithm, you want to know why and have a chance to appeal. On the other hand,
    enough such explanations could allow a decision boundary to be reverse-engineered
    and allow potential evil doers to game the system. This is very undesirable in
    many cases (e.g. security applications).

    As increasingly more of our economic, social and civic interactions - from credit
    markets and health insurance applications, to recruitment and criminal justice
    systems - are carried out by algorithms, concerns have been raised about the lack
    of transparency behind the technology, which leaves individuals with little understanding
    of how decisions are made about them. We need proper safeguards in place to make
    sure that the decisions that are being made about us are actually fair and accurate.

    (GDPR),  Europe's new data protection framework, was approved. The new regulation
    will come into force across Europe - and the UK - in 2018\. It has been widely
    and repeatedly claimed that a 'right to explanation' of all decisions made by
    automated or artificially intelligent algorithmic systems will be legally mandated
    by the new regulation. This "right to explanation" is viewed as an ideal mechanism
    to enhance the accountability and transparency of automated algorithmic decision-making.

    algorithmic explanations: an explanation of "system functionality" and an explanation
    about the "rationale" of an individual decision. Explaining the algorithmic methods
    used to assess the credit-worthiness or to set interest rates (system functionality)
    does not have the same quality as an explanation of "how" a certain rate was set
    or "why" a credit card application was declined.'

    we examined this claim. Unfortunately, contrary to what was hoped, [our research](https://academic.oup.com/idpl/article/7/2/76/3860948/Why-a-Right-to-Explanation-of-Automated-Decision)
    has revealed that the GDPR is likely to only grant individuals information about
    the existence of automated decision-making and about "system functionality", but
    no explanation about the rationale of a decision. In fact, in the whole GDPR the
    "right to explanation" is only mentioned once in the regulation, in Recital 71,
    which lacks the legal power to establish stand-alone rights. The purpose of a
    Recital is to provide guidance on how to interpret the operational part of a regulatory
    framework, if there is ambiguity. But in our research,  I see there is no ambiguity
    regarding the minimum requirements that requires further clarification.

    of the European Parliament to make this right legally binding was not adopted,
    suggests that European legislators did not want to grant this idea the same legal
    status as the other safeguards in the legally binding text in Art 22 GDPR. Of
    course, that does not mean that data controllers could not voluntarily decide
    to offer explanations, or that future jurisprudence or law built on this Recital
    could create such a right in the future.

    the GDPR mandates a "right to explanation" from machine learning models - meaning
    that those significantly affected by such models are due an accounting of how
    the model made a particular decision - has become a controversial subject. Some
    scholars, for example, have spoken out vehemently against the mere possibility
    that such a right exists. Others, such as the UK's own Information Commissioner's
    Office, seem to think the right is pretty clearly self-evident.
