- en: Python is the most popular language for data analytics, machine learning, and
    automation tasks due to its simplicity, vast library of data science tools like
    NumPy and Pandas, integration with Jupyter Notebooks which allows easy experimentation
    and visualization, and versatility for a wide range of uses, making it the ideal
    language for beginners to learn when first getting into data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are just starting out in your data science career, I highly recommend
    getting started with Python and its most popular data science libraries like NumPy,
    Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. Learning Python along with these libraries
    will give you a solid foundation to get things done efficiently and without too
    many headaches, setting you up for success as you progress in data science.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning SQL is crucial for anyone working with data. You will use it to extract
    and analyze information from SQL databases, and it is a fundamental skill for
    data professionals. By understanding SQL, you can interact with relational database
    management systems such as MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL to retrieve, organize,
    and modify data effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The basics of SQL include the ability to select specific data using the SELECT
    statement, insert new data with the INSERT statement, update existing data using
    the UPDATE statement, and delete data that is old or invalid using the DELETE
    statement.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bash/Shell are not traditional programming languages, they are invaluable tools
    for working with data. Bash scripts allow you to string together commands to automate
    repetitive or complex data tasks that would be tedious to perform manually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bash scripts can be used to manipulate text files by searching, filtering and
    organizing data. They can automate ETL pipelines to extract data, transform it
    and load it into databases. Bash also allows you to perform calculations, splits,
    joins and other operations on data files from the command line and interact with
    databases using SQL queries and commands.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rust is an up-and-coming language for data science thanks to its strong performance,
    memory safety, and concurrency features. However, Rust is still relatively new
    for data applications and has some disadvantages compared to Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being a younger language, Rust has far fewer libraries for data science tasks
    than Python. The ecosystem of machine learning and data analysis libraries still
    needs to mature in Rust, meaning most codebases must be written from scratch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, Rust's strengths, like performance, memory, and thread safety, make
    it a good fit for building efficient and reliable backends for data science systems.
    Rust is well-suited for low-level code optimizations and parallelization needed
    in some data pipelines.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Julia is a programming language specifically created for scientific and high-performance
    numerical computing. One of its unique features is the ability to optimize code
    during the compilation process, which enables it to perform as well as, or even
    better than, C programming language. Additionally, Julia's syntax is inspired
    by popular programming languages like MATLAB, Python and R, making it easy for
    data scientists already familiar with these languages to learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Julia is open source and has a growing community of developers and data scientists
    contributing to its ongoing improvement. Overall, Julia provides a great balance
    of productivity, flexibility and performance - making it a valuable tool for data
    scientists, particularly those working on performance-constrained problems.

- en: 6\. R
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: R is a popular programming language that is widely used for data science and
    statistical computing. It is well-suited for data science because it has a wide
    range of built-in functions and libraries for data manipulation, visualization,
    and analysis. These functions and libraries allow users to perform a variety of
    tasks, such as importing and cleaning data, exploring data sets, and building
    statistical models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: R is also known for its powerful graphics capabilities. The language includes
    a variety of tools for creating high-quality graphs and visualizations, which
    are essential for data exploration and communication.

- en: 7\. C++
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C++ is a high-performance programming language that is widely used for building
    high performance complex machine learning applications. Although it is not as
    commonly used in data science as some other languages like Python and R, C++ has
    several features that make it an excellent choice for certain types of data science
    tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key advantages of C++ is its speed. C++ is a compiled language, meaning
    that code is translated into machine code before it is executed, which can result
    in faster execution times than interpreted languages like Python and R.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another advantage of C++ is its ability to handle large data sets. C++ has low-level
    memory management capabilities, which means that it can efficiently work with
    very large data sets without running into memory issues that can slow down other
    languages.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're looking for a programming language that is cleaner and less wordy
    than Java, then Scala might be a great option for you. It's a versatile and flexible
    language that combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main benefits of Scala for data science is its ability to seamlessly
    integrate with big data frameworks like Apache Spark. This is because Scala runs
    on the same JVMs as these frameworks, making it a great choice for distributed
    big data projects and data pipelines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're aiming for a career in data engineering or database management, learning
    Scala will help you excel in your career. However, as a data scientist, it is
    not necessary to acquire knowledge in this language.
