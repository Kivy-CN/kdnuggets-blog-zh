    Snippet by Author.     **The above code generates a complete profiling report
    of the data**, which we can use to further move our EDA process, without the need
    to write any more code!    We’ll go through the various sections of the report
    in the following sections. In what concerns the **overall characteristics of the
    data**, all the information we were looking for is included in the ***Overview* section**:  ![A

    ydata-profiling: Data Profiling Report — Dataset Overview. Image by Author.     We
    can see that our dataset comprises **15 features and 32561 observations,** with **23
    duplicate records, and an overall missing rate of 0.9%**.    Additionally, the
    dataset has been correctly identified as a **tabular dataset**, and rather heterogeneous,
    presenting both **numerical and categorical features**. For **time-series data**,
    which has time dependency and presents different types of patterns, `ydata-profiling` would
    incorporate [other statistics and analysis in the report](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-do-an-eda-for-time-series-cbb92b3b1913).    We
    can further inspect the **raw data and existing duplicate records **to have an
    overall understanding of the features, before going into more complex analysis:  ![A

    ydata-profiling: Data Profiling Report — Sample preview. Image by Author.     **From
    the brief sample preview** of the data sample, we can see right away that although
    the dataset has a low percentage of missing data overall, **some features might
    be affected by it** more than others. We can also identify a rather **considerable
    number of categories** for some features, and 0-valued features (or at least with
    a significant amount of 0’s).  ![A Data Scientist’s Essential Guide to Exploratory
    Data Analysis](../Images/83eb1be6ac8f773953f9c81899ed138c.png) ydata-profiling:
    Data Profiling Report — Duplicate rows preview. Image by Author.     **Regarding
    the duplicate rows**, it would not be strange to find “repeated” observations
    given that most features represent categories where several people might “fit
    in” simultaneously.    Yet, perhaps a **“data smell”** could be that these observations
    share the same `age` values (which is plausible) and the exact same `fnlwgt` which,
    considering the presented values, seems harder to believe. So further analysis
    would be required, but we should **most likely drop these duplicates** later on.    Overall,
    the data overview might be a simple analysis, but one **extremely impactful**,
    as it will help us define the upcoming tasks in our pipeline.    # Step 2: Feature
    Assessment and Visualization    After having a peek at the overall data descriptors,
    we need to** zoom in on our dataset’s features**, in order to get some insights
    on their individual properties — **Univariate Analysis** — as well their interactions
    and relationships — **Multivariate Analysis**.    Both tasks rely heavily on **investigating
    adequate statistics and visualizations**, which need to be to **tailored to the
    type of feature** at hand (e.g., numeric, categorical), **and the behavior** we’re
    looking to dissect (e.g., interactions, correlations).    ## Let’s take a look
    at best practices for each task.    ## Univariate Analysis    Analyzing the individual
    characteristics of each feature is crucial as it will help us decide on their **relevance
    for the analysis **and the** type of data preparation** they may require to achieve
    optimal results.    For instance, we may find values that are extremely out of
    range and may refer to **inconsistencies** or **outliers**. We may need to **standardize** **numerical** **data** or
    perform a **one-hot encoding of categorical** features, depending on the number
    of existing categories. Or we may have to perform additional data preparation
    to handle numeric features that are **shifted or skewed,** if the machine learning
    algorithm we intend to use expects a particular distribution (normally Gaussian).    Best
    practices therefore call for the thorough investigation of individual properties
    such as descriptive statistics and data distribution.    **These will highlight
    the need for subsequent tasks of outlier removal, standardization, label encoding,
    data imputation, data augmentation, and other types of preprocessing.**    Let’s
    investigate `race` and `capital.gain` in more detail. *What can we immediately
    spot?*  ![A Data Scientist’s Essential Guide to Exploratory Data Analysis](../Images/8d14d63dfcb4602fd3577ecb45a38d0a.png)
