- en: Many associate “data science” with self-driving cars, artificial intelligence,
    smart cities and bioinformatics, though it is increasingly part of marketing.
    Marketing data science is multifaceted but at its core is personalized marketing,
    a high-tech extension of [direct marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/direct-marketing.asp).
    Two manifestations of it, personalized ads and recommendations, are now so ubiquitous
    that they often escape our notice.

    marketing. The Data and Marketing Association [website](https://thedma.org/) may
    also be of interest to many readers, and the JM-MSI Special Issue: "[From Marketing

    as economic downturns and technological innovation, not to mention pandemics. [Privacy
    legislation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) as well as the popularity of ad blockers and
    search engines which do not track are having an impact. A "[cookieless future](https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/09/28/navigating-a-cookieless-future/)"

    in the first place. Some maintain it doesn't really work from a technical standpoint,
    that is, that personalized ads and recommendations do not actually reach the right
    people at the right time, or the right people at any time.

    marketing consists of imputed and aggregate data that have been mashed together.
    Marketing scientists and others who analyze and model data know that missing data
    and even small errors in a single data file can wreak havoc on our analytics.

    marketing is more effective than mass marketing or the macro segmentation most

- en: '[Predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics) as
    currently practiced is mainly concerned with the What (which includes where, how,
    by whom, and how often) but not the Why. Understanding why consumers behave as
    they do can help marketers predict their future behavior, communicate effectively
    with them, and design products they''ll like. Inferring why they behave as they
    do from what they''ve done in the past is not always straightforward because different
    people may do the same things for different reasons. They might also do different
    things for the same reasons.'

- en: A simple example would be household cleaners. One person might buy Lysol Clean
    most often because of its disinfectant properties, and another because it’s easy
    to find where they usually shop. One person might use Goo Gone because they like
    its fragrance, and someone else Citrasolv because they like *its* fragrance.

    Gone因为他们喜欢它的香味，而另一个人则使用Citrasolv因为他们喜欢*它的*香味。
- en: Another concept sometimes called the multiple me also comes into play. This
    notion reflects the simple fact that consumer behavior often varies according
    to occasion or motivation - buying wine for cooking versus buying wine to celebrate
    a promotion being one illustration. Our behavior can also vary with time due to
    changes in personal circumstances, such as marriage, birth of a child, a promotion
    or relocation. Our tastes may change too.

  zh: 另一个有时被称为“多重自我”的概念也会发挥作用。这一观念反映了这样一个简单事实：消费者行为往往会根据场合或动机而有所不同——例如，为了烹饪而购买葡萄酒与为了庆祝晋升而购买葡萄酒就是一个例子。我们的行为也可能因个人情况的变化而有所不同，如婚姻、孩子出生、晋升或搬迁。我们的口味也可能发生变化。

- en: Other critics say personalized marketing frequently subsidizes purchases that
    would have been made anyway and, in the process, increases price consciousness
    among consumers and, over time, can erode brand equity. Smart marketers, indeed,
    would be wise to avoid encouraging deal shopping. Les Binet and Peter Field have
    much to say worth listening to regarding these topics.

    Binet和Peter Field在这些话题上有很多值得倾听的观点。
- en: Some maintain that personalized marketing usually works but isn't always cost
    effective. Marketing ROI can be tricky to estimate since some costs are guestimates,
    and adjusting for exogenous factors such as recessions and competitor activity
    is challenging - competitors’ marketing, for example, can actually benefit our
    brand if it helps grow the category.

  zh: 有人认为个性化营销通常有效，但并不总是成本效益高。市场营销的投资回报率（ROI）很难估算，因为一些成本是估算的，而且调整外部因素如经济衰退和竞争者活动是具有挑战性的——例如，竞争对手的营销如果帮助扩大市场份额，实际上可能对我们的品牌有利。
- en: Moreover, it may appear cost-effective if the investment in data infrastructure
    and analytics teams are ignored. Cost-effectiveness of targeting can also be deceptive
    when we have a higher “hit” rate among a much smaller number of consumers than
    without targeting. Overall sales may actually decline with targeting even when
    marketing ROI is higher.

  zh: 此外，如果忽略了对数据基础设施和分析团队的投资，可能会显得成本效益更高。即使在我们在一个较小的消费者群体中拥有更高的“命中”率时，目标营销的成本效益也可能具有误导性。即使营销ROI更高，总体销售可能仍会因目标营销而下降。

    Institute, feel targeting as a rule is a bad habit and a bad idea. *How Brands
    Grow* (Sharp), *How Brands Grow: Part 2* (Romaniuk and Sharp), and *Building Distinctive
    Brand Assets* (Romaniuk) in my opinion are must-reads for marketers and marketing

    are related to marketing and have benefited from having more data, richer data
    and more sophisticated analytics tools. I should also point out that predictive
    analytics and other aspects of personalized marketing can be enhanced by traditional
    marketing research methods such as focus groups and consumer surveys. It’s not
    either/or.

    light on the Why. Awareness of this synergy is growing among marketing researchers,
    if not among data scientists, who are often focused on data management and programming.
    I’ve long felt this was an overlooked opportunity for marketing research.

    article, as a marketing data science person myself my own biases mostly run in
    the opposite direction. However, as a businessperson I cannot afford to believe
    in panaceas or just believe what I wish to believe. Even before the pandemic,
    I sensed growing skepticism in the business community and among investors regarding
    AI and the value of big data - see *Big Data, Big Dupe* (Few) and *laughing@big
    data* (Jones) for examples of what I mean.
