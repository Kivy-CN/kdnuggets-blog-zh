    changed everything. We have seen companies like Google coming under pressure for
    the first time, there is uncertainty in the current job market, and open-source
    development is firing on all cylinders. It is hard to keep up with AI development
    and misinformation.

- en: In my opinion, both open-source and closed-source AI development is necessary.
    You need to understand that the backbone of ChatGPT is [Transformers](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html)
    which is open-source and developed by a team at Google Brain. Without open-source
    development, we will have slow innovation. There are so many community lead projects
    that are running big corporations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On other hand, closed sources have the proper team, resources, and capital to
    develop polished products. In the OpenAI case, DALLE 2 and ChatGPT require multiple
    GPUs, and sometimes the cost of just experimenting can rise to multi-millions.
    It is a clean and bug free application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you ask me, I would say open source is better. Open source projects are publicly
    available, are transparent, drive innovation, and developers can earn money by
    selling licenses or by providing additional features.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No. Let me explain in simple terms. AI will never replace any job. It is here
    to assist us. There will be a huge workplace cultural change. People who leverage
    AI tools will gradually replace those who are still performing manual tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know the Dalle-2, Mid Journey, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 are great, but trust me
    they are not better than average humans. ChatGPT makes mistakes, and it doesn't
    understand complex tasks and concepts. For example, if you ask ChatGPT to develop
    a proper application with multiple integrations, it will fail to understand the
    whole picture. You have to make multiple manual changes to get things right.

    that, you are allowing OpenAI to access your chat, and for a company, it is a
    concern. You can resolve this issue by creating your own ChatGPT application using

    for 6 months?

    signed by Elon Musk and 11,761 individuals, including AI experts, has been issued
    by the non-profit organization, Future of Life Institute. The letter calls for
    a temporary halt to the development of advanced AI for six months. The signatories
    urge AI labs to avoid training any technology that surpasses the capabilities
    of OpenAI's GPT-4, which was launched recently.

    stop open-source development or developments made by countries like China? The
    cat is out of the box. What we can do is work towards making it safe and secure.

- en: In my opinion, I believe that there is a business angle to this open letter
    too. A lot of companies are failing to launch successful applications like GPT-4,
    and they need 6 months of breathing room to develop and compete with Microsoft
    and OpenAI.

    to take input as image, video, and audio and output text, image, and audio. For
    example, if you ask AI to write a technical blog, it will add text, code blocks,
    and images to create a proper blog that you can publish. Or you can talk to an
    AI like a person and it will respond to you via audio like Jarvis from iron man.

    a self-aware machine that can think and decide on its own. These models and AI
    applications are built on human-generated data, and for AI to exceed humans on
    all levels it needs to learn on its own. So, I will not see AGI in my lifetime,
    but I am hopeful.
