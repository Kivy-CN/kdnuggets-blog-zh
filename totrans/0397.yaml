    goods of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production
    of other goods or services. [...] The quality of a given commodity may differ
    slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers.

    of these characteristics should suggest to you that you should acquire the same
    set of skills and expertise that everyone else has! Everything about the innate

    to becoming one and the skills one acquires along the way whispers "conformity."

    non-technical, that others around you don't have, you are an endangered species.
    In the animal kingdom this may not be beneficial for a species long term survival,
    but as an employable data scientist it certainly is.

    Nobody is looking for an expert in a new tool that came out yesterday, but once
    everyone is using it, your skills no longer make you that endangered species.
  prefs: []

    have yet to catch on but show real promise. Getting in on the ground floor and
    making some contributions would be a great way to differentiate yourself vis-s-vis
    that tool, especially when it goes prime time.

    achieve the success that it likely should be enjoying. I think JAX is a great
    example of this. JAX has been around for some years, it is lower level than other
    similar tools so it has a following of folks looking for this advantage, and its
    popularity continues to grow. Adding some expertise here would set you apart form
    the TensorFlow or PyTorch crowd, especially if you are familiar with all of the
