    and want to move to some practical resources, or simply have an interest in other
    approaches, which may not necessarily be dependent on neural networks? This post
    (hopefully) will be helpful.

    Toolkit (NLTK), which you have either heard of already or need to start learning
    about right away.

- en: This tutorial is much more focused than the previous resources, in that it covers
    implementing an LSTM for language modeling in Keras. That's it. But it does so
    in detail, with explanation, code, and visuals, and gets the point across. Less
    of a time investment than the other resource thus far, you can get through this
    start to finish, including reproducing the code yourself, within a couple of hours.

- en: In this tutorial, I’ll concentrate on creating LSTM networks in Keras, briefly
    giving a recap or overview of how LSTMs work. In this Keras LSTM tutorial, we’ll
    implement a sequence-to-sequence text prediction model by utilizing a large text
    data set called the PTB corpus.

    which has [code here](https://github.com/pmsosa/CS291K) -- uses a combined LSTM/CNN
    approach to analyzing sentiment. The project flips up architectures, and reports
    the varying performances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our CNN-LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 3% higher than the CNN model, but
    3.2% worse than the LSTM model. Meanwhile, our LSTM-CNN model performed 8.5% better
    than a CNN model and 2.7% better than an LSTM model.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can't independently endorse the project's results; however, the innovative
    approach to sentiment (and the fact that it was a sentiment analysis-based resource)
    paired with mixing in some different neural network architectures is what led
    me to include it in this list, despite its shorter length.
