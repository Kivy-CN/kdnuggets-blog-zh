- en: Date Engineering is one of the fastest growing and in-demand occupations among
    Data Science practitioners. The ability to collect, store, query, clean and manipulate
    databases fast, efficiently and effectively becomes more important as the data
    we generate gets bigger and bigger each day as we consume more technological services.

- en: The course begins with an introduction to Python and moves onto SQL which develops
    further into learning how to use PostgresSQL and Data Structures and Algorithms.
    It seems to have a more breadth view of the topics and centers around using Python
    and SQL. This is a good course for someone beginning their journey into the data
    engineering landscape but because of the course structure it seems to be useful
    to have some basic Python knowledge at the least.
