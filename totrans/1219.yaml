    data science without doing *thorough* research on whether it’s truly the role
    for them. They end up doing SO much work to get skilled up, only to land a data
    science position and find out they’re MISERABLE on the job.

- en: Well, in the beginning of our career, fresh out of school with many of us carrying
    student loan debt, we’re usually looking to take care of our most basic needs
    (physiological and safety). Our priority is putting a roof over our heads and
    getting to a steady financial place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But once we progress in our career, our needs change. We begin to want the recognition,
    the accolades, the promotions - in other words, our esteem needs. Finally, once
    we’ve gotten the money and the praise, we often find ourselves searching for MORE.
    This is the stage of seeking true fulfillment and greater impact as a data professional.
