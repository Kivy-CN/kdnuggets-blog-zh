  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In its most simplistic definition, a vector database stores information as vectors
    (vector embeddings), which are a numerical version of a data object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As such, vector embeddings are a powerful method of indexing and searching across
    very large and unstructured or semi-unstructured [datasets](/datasets/index.html).
    These datasets can consist of text, images, or sensor data and a vector database
    orders this information into a manageable format.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vector databases work using high-dimensional vectors which can contain hundreds
    of different dimensions, each linked to a specific property of a data object.
    Thus creating an unrivaled level of complexity.
