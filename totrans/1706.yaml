- en: With the dawn of the age of Data Science, there is an increased interest in
    learning and applying algorithms, not just by business analysts or data scientists,
    but by several other professionals whose core job may not be crunching data or
    building models. Good sign, indeed, if one understands the when, why and how of
    applying these fantastic techniques.

- en: '**1\. Linear relationship** between the Y (DV) and X’s (IV). If your scatterplot
    shows curvilinear relationship, keep in mind that higher order polynomials (2
    or above) may do a better job at modelling the data. Compare models, statistics
    and decide for yourself which model best explains your data.'

- en: '**2\. Multicollinearity** – the absence of it. For validity of a LR model,
    the VIF (Variance Inflationary Factor) should not be too high. How high is too
    high? Well, usually a VIF of 5 is used as threshold. Some even use a 2.5\. You
    can do your own research on this, but almost always a VIF as high as 10 is way
    too high. A high VIF indicates presence of multicollinearity, that is, high correlation
    between IVs. You can test your model by removing one or more correlated IVs and
    re-running the model. You can also use other dimension reduction techniques such
    as PCA (Principal Component Analysis).'

- en: '**3\. Homoscedasticity** – *Homo* means similar and *scedasticity* means distribution
    of error terms. Thus, homoscedasticity means that the error terms are similarly
    (read randomly) distributed. If there is any non-random behaviour in the error
    terms, such as in the residual Vs fit plot below, then the model is said to be
    suffering from an ailment called Heteroscedasticity. This can also be detected
    by the methods such as the ncv test. Transformation of variables using methods
    such as Box-Cox, or trying out different variables altogether can resolve this
    issue in a model.'

- en: '**4\. Residual Normality**– The error terms are also called residuals. This
    is the difference between observed value of the DV(y) and the predicted value
    (ŷ). The error term is something that keeps us from perfect prediction. Remember
    that in calculating standard deviation we use {x-x̄}, and in Chi-Square tests
    we use the {Observed- Expected} value in calculations. Residual analysis is an
    integral part of several statistical methods, including LR. The assumption for
    LR is that the residuals must be independent and randomly distributed with a mean
    of zero, which technically means that the residuals should pass the normality
    test. This can be tested by extracting the residuals and subjecting to normality
    tests such as Anderson-Darling Test or Shapiro test, or graphically, with the
    help of a quantile plot or probability plot. Presence of non-random behaviour
    indicates that there is some adjustment that needs to be made to the model. Outliers
    could be the culprit, or that higher order terms are required. Transformations
    can also come handy in some cases.'

- en: '**5\. Autocorrelation** – should not be present. In the previous point, I have
    stated that residuals must be Independent and normally distributed. When the independence
    of residuals is violated, we can see patterns such as the one below, or cyclical
    trends upwards or downwards for a residuals Vs order plot. This can also be detected
    by applying a Durbin-Watson test on the data. Solutions, again, can be of several
    types such as using a different model or transforming some of the variables.'

    to apply. There are several cases, that I have found in my projects, that Linear
    Regression works quite well in modelling the data. It comes as no surprise that
    Linear Regression is still one of the most commonly used algorithms for data modelling.
