- en: The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general
    methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a
    large margin. The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law, or rather its generalization
    of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of computation. Most AI research
    has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent were constant
    (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve
    performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project,
    massively more computation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an improvement
    that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their
    human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters, in the long run,
    is the leveraging of computation. These two need not run counter to each other,
    but in practice, they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other.
    There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other.
    And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make
    them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation. 
    There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson,
    and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent.

  zh: 从70年的人工智能研究中可以得出的最大教训是，利用计算的一般方法最终是最有效的，并且差距很大。最终原因是摩尔定律，或者更准确地说，是其对计算单位成本持续指数下降的普遍化。大多数人工智能研究都假设代理可用的计算是恒定的（在这种情况下，利用人类知识将是提高性能的唯一途径之一），但在比典型研究项目稍长的时间内，大量更多的计算不可避免地变得可用。为了在短期内寻求有意义的改进，研究人员试图利用他们对领域的知识，但从长远来看，唯一重要的事情是利用计算。这两者并不一定相互矛盾，但在实践中往往会。投入到一种方法上的时间就是没有投入到另一种方法上的时间。对一种方法的心理投入往往会影响另一种方法。而人类知识的方法往往使方法复杂化，从而使其不太适合利用计算的通用方法。许多人工智能研究人员在之后才认识到这一苦涩的教训，回顾一些最突出的例子是很有启发性的。

- en: In computer chess, the methods that defeated the world champion, Kasparov, in
    1997, were based on massive, deep search. At the time, this was looked upon with
    dismay by the majority of computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that
    leveraged human understanding of the special structure of chess. When a simpler,
    search-based approach with special hardware and software proved vastly more effective,
    these human-knowledge-based chess researchers were not good losers. They said
    that ``brute force" search may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy,
    and anyway, it was not how people played chess. These researchers wanted methods
    based on human input to win and were disappointed when they did not.

  zh: 在计算机国际象棋中，1997年击败世界冠军卡斯帕罗夫的方法是基于大规模、深度搜索的。当时，大多数计算机国际象棋研究人员对这种方法感到失望，他们曾追求那些利用人类对国际象棋特殊结构理解的方法。当一种更简单、基于搜索的方法配合特殊硬件和软件证明了更有效时，这些依赖人类知识的国际象棋研究人员并不善于接受失败。他们说，“蛮力”搜索可能这次获胜，但这不是一种通用策略，而且反正这也不是人们下棋的方式。这些研究人员希望基于人类输入的方法获胜，当他们未能实现这一点时感到失望。
- en: A similar pattern of research progress was seen in computer Go, only delayed
    by a further 20 years. Enormous initial efforts went into avoiding search by taking
    advantage of human knowledge, or of the special features of the game, but all
    those efforts proved irrelevant, or worse, once search was applied effectively
    at scale. Also important was the use of learning by self-play to learn a value
    function (as it was in many other games and even in chess, although learning did
    not play a big role in the 1997 program that first beat a world champion). Learning
    by self-play, and learning in general, is like search in that it enables massive
    computation to be brought to bear. Search and learning are the two most important
    classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI research.
    In computer Go, as in computer chess, researchers' initial effort was directed
    towards utilizing human understanding (so that less search was needed) and only
    much later was a much greater success had by embracing search and learning.

  zh: 计算机围棋中的研究进展模式与此类似，只是延迟了20年。最初的大量努力旨在通过利用人类知识或游戏的特殊特性来避免搜索，但一旦有效地大规模应用搜索，这些努力都证明了无关紧要，甚至更糟。自我对弈学习以学习价值函数也非常重要（正如在许多其他游戏中一样，甚至在国际象棋中也是如此，尽管在1997年首次击败世界冠军的程序中，学习并没有发挥重要作用）。自我对弈学习和学习一般来说与搜索类似，因为它能使大量计算得以运用。搜索和学习是人工智能研究中利用大量计算的两个最重要的技术类别。在计算机围棋中，与计算机国际象棋类似，研究人员最初的努力是集中在利用人类理解（以减少搜索需求），而只有在很晚的时候，通过采用搜索和学习才取得了更大的成功。
- en: In speech recognition, there was an early competition, sponsored by DARPA, in
    the 1970s. Entrants included a host of special methods that took advantage of
    human knowledge---knowledge of words, of phonemes, of the human vocal tract, etc.
    On the other side were newer methods that were more statistical in nature and
    did much more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Again, the statistical
    methods won out over the human-knowledge-based methods. This led to a major change
    in all of natural language processing, gradually over decades, where statistics
    and computation came to dominate the field. The recent rise of deep learning in
    speech recognition is the most recent step in this consistent direction. Deep
    learning methods rely even less on human knowledge, and use even more computation,
    together with learning on huge training sets, to produce dramatically better speech
    recognition systems. As in the games, researchers always tried to make systems
    that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked---they tried
    to put that knowledge in their systems---but it proved ultimately counterproductive,
    and a colossal waste of researcher's time, when, through Moore's law, massive
    computation became available and a means was found to put it to good use.

  zh: 在语音识别领域，1970年代有过一次由DARPA赞助的早期竞赛。参赛者包括大量利用人类知识的特殊方法——词汇知识、音素知识、人体发音道知识等。另一方面是基于隐藏马尔可夫模型（HMMs）的统计性方法，这些方法计算量大得多。统计方法再次战胜了基于人类知识的方法。这导致了自然语言处理领域的重大变化，逐渐经历了数十年，统计和计算成为主导。最近语音识别领域深度学习的崛起是这一一致方向的最新一步。深度学习方法甚至更少依赖于人类知识，使用更多的计算和在巨大训练集上进行学习，以产生更出色的语音识别系统。正如在游戏中一样，研究人员总是试图使系统按照他们认为自己思维运作的方式工作——他们试图将这种知识放入他们的系统中——但最终证明这是适得其反的，并且是对研究人员时间的巨大浪费，当摩尔定律下，大规模计算成为可能，并找到了有效利用它的方法时。
- en: In computer vision, there has been a similar pattern. Early methods conceived
    of vision as searching for edges, or generalized cylinders, or in terms of SIFT
    features. But today, all this is discarded. Modern deep-learning neural networks
    use only the notions of convolution and certain kinds of invariances and perform
    much better.

  zh: 在计算机视觉领域，也出现了类似的模式。早期的方法将视觉视为寻找边缘、或通用的圆柱体，或以SIFT特征来进行处理。但今天，所有这些都被抛弃了。现代的深度学习神经网络仅使用卷积和某些类型的不变性，表现得更好。
- en: This is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as
    we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes. To see this and to effectively
    resist it, we have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn
    the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the
    long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI
    researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always
    helps in the short term and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3)
    in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough
    progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation
    by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often
    incompletely digested because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.

  zh: 这是一个重要的教训。作为一个领域，我们仍未彻底领会这一点，因为我们继续犯同样的错误。为了看清这一点并有效抵制它，我们必须理解这些错误的吸引力。我们必须吸取苦涩的教训，即在我们认为自己思考的方式中构建知识在长期内是行不通的。这个苦涩的教训基于以下历史观察：1）人工智能研究人员常常试图将知识构建到他们的代理中，2）这在短期内总是有帮助，并且对研究人员来说是个人上令人满意的，但3）从长远来看，这会停滞不前，甚至抑制进一步的进展，4）突破性的进展最终通过一种基于计算规模化的搜索和学习的对立方法到来。最终的成功带有苦涩，常常因为是对一种偏爱的、人本中心方法的胜利而未被完全消化。
- en: One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of
    general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation
    even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem
    to scale arbitrarily in this way are *search* and *learning*.

- en: The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual
    contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying
    to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways
    to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part
    of the arbitrary, intrinsically complex, outside world. They are not what should
    be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead, we should build in only
    the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential
    to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for
    them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover
    like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries
    only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.

  zh: 从这个痛苦的教训中学习到的第二个一般性观点是，心智的实际内容极其复杂、无法挽回；我们应停止寻找关于心智内容的简单思维方式，如关于空间、物体、多个代理或对称性的简单思维方式。所有这些都是任意的、内在复杂的外部世界的一部分。它们不应该被内建，因为它们的复杂性是无穷的；相反，我们应该只内建能够发现和捕捉这种任意复杂性的元方法。这些方法的关键是它们能找到好的近似值，但寻找这些近似值的过程应该由我们的方法完成，而不是由我们自己完成。我们希望AI代理能够像我们一样发现，而不是包含我们已经发现的内容。内建我们的发现只会让我们更难看到发现过程是如何进行的。
