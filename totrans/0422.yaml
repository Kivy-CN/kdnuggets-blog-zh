    it. There are no shortcuts to writing quality blogs, and you must learn from your
    mistakes and improve with time. You also need to assess the trend and write about
    things you love. Make it personalized, grow your brand, and increase your following.

    I have written more than 50 blogs and 40 technical articles. I have received an
    award from Analytics Vidhya for writing the best tutorial and got multiple awards
    from KDnuggets. If you are interested in my work, check out my [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/kingabzpro/collections/893)

- en: The title is one of the most important things about the blog. You should spend
    at least two hours brainstorming the best title that could go viral. It is the
    first thing that will make your readers click on the blog post. If your title
    is engaging or provides additive value to your readers, they will eventually read
    the whole thing. The art of writing titles comes from practice but, you can also
    use tools to become better. These tools have worked for me. The internet is full
    of SEO optimization tools and almost every other platform offers title generation.

    up with a title that works for you.'

    thing about your blog - [t-sciences.com](https://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better).

    the audience. Readers will skip the whole blog to read fun facts or figures. The
    modern generation has a shorter attention span, so you need to come up with a
    blog that is short and full of cookies. These cookies will help enhance readers'
    experience and in return you will be gaining loyal viewership. I usually add images,
    facts & figures, plots, bullet points, headings, quotations, and conclusions.
    The whole idea of writing a blog is to make the reading experience smooth.

    the overall reading experience where you can follow the entire tutorial.
