    and index vector embeddings for efficient retrieval and similarity search. It
    is used in various applications that involve large language models, generative
    AI, and semantic search. Vector embeddings are mathematical representations of
    data that capture semantic information and allow for understanding patterns, relationships,
    and underlying structures.
