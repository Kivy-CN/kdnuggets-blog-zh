    of the components that comprise an enterprise production deployment workflow,
    as illustrated in Fig 1 [[1](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems)] below.​​​​​​​ To
    operationalize ML models, data scientists are required to work closely with multiple
    other teams such as business, engineering, and operations. This represents organizational
    challenges in terms of communication, collaboration, and coordination. The goal
    of MLOps is to streamline such challenges with well-established practices. Additionally, MLOps
    brings about agility and speed that is a cornerstone in today's digital world.

    to help data scientists overcome challenges common to software productionisation.
    For example, the use of agile methodology promoted by DevOps in contrast to waterfall
    methodology is an efficiency boost. Additional DevOps practices used in MLOps
    are listed in Table 1.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

    models/algorithms and hand them over to operations to deploy into production.
    Lack of coordination and improper handoff between the two parties lead to delays
    and errors.**3) Ineffective communication between teams leads to delays in the
    final solution: **The evaluation of an ML solution usually comes towards the end
    of the project lifecycle. With the development teams usually working in silos,
    the solution becomes a black-box to other stakeholders. This is worsened by the
    lack of intermediate feedback. These pose significant challenges in terms of time,
    effort, and resources.​​​ | **Agile methodology **solves this coordination problem
    by enforcing an end-to-end pipeline set up at the initial stage itself. Agile
    methodology divides the project into a sprint. In each sprint, developers deliver
    incremental features that are ready for deployment. The output from each sprint
    (made using pipelines) is visible to each and every member from a very early stage
    of the project. Therefore, the risk of **last-minute surprises reduces,** and **early
    feedback** becomes a common practice. In industry parlance, this does a "shift

- en: According to industry parlance, MLOps is DevOps for ML. While it is true to
    some extent, there are challenges typical to ML that need to be addressed by MLOps
    platforms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example of such a challenge is the role of data. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​In traditional
    software engineering (i.e., software 1.0), developers write logic and rules (as
    code) that are well defined in the program space, as demonstrated in Fig 2 [[2](https://medium.com/%40karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)]. However,
    in machine learning (i.e., software 2.0), data scientists write code that defines
    how to use parameters to solve a business problem. The parameter values are found using data
    (with techniques such as gradient descent). These values may change with different
    versions of the data, thereby changing the code behavior. In other words, data
    plays an equally important role as the written code in defining the output. And
    both can change independently of each other. This adds a layer of data complexity
    in addition to the model code as an intrinsic part of the software that needs
    to be defined and tracked.​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​

    code versioning tools are used to track changes. Version control is a prerequisite
    for any continuous integration (CI) solution as it enables reproducibility in
    a fully automated fashion. Any change in source code triggers the CI/CD pipeline
    to build, test and deliver production-ready code.In Machine Learning, output model
    can change if algorithm code or hyper-parameters or data change. While code and
    hyper-parameters are controlled by developers, change in data may not be. This
    warrants the concept of data and hyper-parameters versioning in addition to algorithm
    code. Note that data versioning is a challenge for unstructured data such as images
    and audio and that MLOps platforms adopt unique approaches to this challenge.

    development is **iterative and experimental**. It requires a lot of parameter
    tuning and feature engineering. ML pipelines work with data versions, algorithm
    code versions and/or hyper-parameters. Any change in these artifacts (independently)
    trigger new deployable model versions that warrant experimentation and metrics
    calculations. MLOps platforms tracks the complete lineage for these artifacts.
