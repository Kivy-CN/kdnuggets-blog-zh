    on the validation dataset. You’re happy that you were able to apply your data
    science and machine learning skills in building this model. However, you realize
    that the model working fine—inside your Jupyter notebook—on your local machine
    is not very helpful (yet).

    learning, the models have to be deployed to production. However, *deploying and
    maintaining machine learning models* is not without challenges. A model that performs
    well in the development environment may fail miserably in the production environment.
    This could result from data and concept drifts and other factors that lead to
    such degradation in performance.

    more granular information on the performance of the different versions of the
    model, MLOps engineers often use *model versioning* and *experiment tracking*.

    level of automation. Let’s try to understand the challenges associated with it.

- en: Once an application is deployed to production, it’s possible that the data that
    the model uses—in production—is drastically different from the data that it was
    trained on. As a result, such a model will perform poorly, and we often have to
    retrain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MLOps engineers also handle the retraining and automation of the retraining
    process by factoring in performance degradation, the frequency at which data changes,
    and the cost of model retraining.
