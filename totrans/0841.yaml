    2001 when 17 people came together to discuss the future of software development.
    It was founded on 4 core values and 12 principles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very popular in the fast-paced, ever-changing technology industry - which
    reflects it nicely. It is a perfect data science project management method as
    it allows team members to continuously review the requirements of the project,
    go back and forth, and communicate more as the project grows. The model evolves
    to reflect user-focused outputs, saving time, money and energy.

    a data science lifecycle, rather than at the end once it's all complete. Let’s
    speak on the 2 steps that you can take to kickstart your agile data science project
    management.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example of an agile method is **Scrum**. The scrum method uses a framework
    that helps to create structure in a team using a set of values, principles, and
    practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, using Scrum, a data science project can break up its larger project
    into a series of smaller projects. Each of these mini-projects will be called
    a sprint and will consist of sprint planning to define objectives, requirements,
    responsibilities and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is this beneficial? Because it helps different members of the team be accountable
    and responsible for their tasks to complete a sprint. Completed sprints all play
    a major role in the end goal of the business, for example launching a new product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Employees focus on delivering value to the end-users by being able to discover
    solutions to challenges that they may come across through the sprints.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kanban is another example of an agile method. It is a popular framework which
    originates from a Japanese inventory management system. Kanban shows employees
    a visual status of their current and pending tasks. Each task, also known as the
    Kanban card, is shown on the Kanban status board and represents its life cycle
    to completion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you can have life cycle columns such as work in progress, developed,
    tested, completed, etc. This can help data scientists identify bottlenecks earlier
    on and reduce the level of tasks work in progress.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kanban is deemed to be a very popular framework in the data science world, with
    a lot of data enthusiasts adopting the method. It is a lightweight process that
    has a visual nature to improve the workflow and identify any challenges easily.
    It is a method that is easy to implement, and data scientists respond very well
    to ‘What is your next task?’, rather than ‘What tasks do you have in your next
    sprint?’.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first initial step in the agile methodology is to plan. Plan, plan, plan!
    I can’t stress enough how important this point is, and that's why it is important
    to learn how to walk before you run. Having a tool such as Monday or Jira is great,
    but you will get nowhere if you do not plan.
  prefs: []

- en: Holding discussion sessions between you and your employees, so that everybody
    is on the same page, everybody understands what needs to be done, and everybody
    has the same plan in their head is essential. Lack of planning can lead to missed
    deadlines, lack of motivation and employee productivity, as well as project infeasibility.

- en: The next phase is designing your project, and this is based on the conversations
    you had with your employees. All the aspects your team covered in your planning
    discussions will help you design an effective solution to your task at hand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Communicating is your biggest tool during this phase. Other members of your
    team may have different ways of working or compartmentalizing tasks. Therefore,
    it is your responsibility as team members to design a solution that caters to
    everybody's needs, based on their method of working, availability, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During this phase, you can allocate who will be owning which aspect of a project.
    This gives employees a sense of importance, which increases their productivity
    levels. Once an employee has been given ownership of a part of a task, it is their
    responsibility to ensure that it runs smoothly, meets deadlines, and everything
    goes as planned.

    point you do not need to communicate with your team members anymore, and you can
    just get to work. That is not true. This is where communication matters the most.
    Weekly stand-ups are important, it helps all employees stay in the loop and bounce
    off one another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the development of your solution for your task at hand, you will come
    across challenges or bottlenecks which can be very overwhelming and will alter
    your timeline, and other people's ability to complete their tasks. Communicating
    every successful and unsuccessful step is important to keep all members in the
    loop, and it allows people to give you a helping hand.

    definitely test it some more.

    comes to data science projects. Not only did team members invest their time and
    energy into this solution, it would be even better if it is accurate and solves
    the problem at hand.

- en: Data scientists need to put their minds in a place as if they were handing the
    solution over to the customer next. Reviewing, documenting, fixing, and discussing
    the whole data science project, and the highs and lows is important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because let’s face it, a similar project will arise and rather than having to
    start from scratch - you have documentation of your previous projects to provide
    you with a stepping stone for your next project. It is these reviews and documents
    which will be used in the first step of discussing/planning your next data science
    project.

    project management is one thing. But being able to get the most out of each phase
    of it is even more important. Communication is important, which you will know
    now as I mentioned a thousand times. But just to remind you, to reap the rewards,
    you have to work hard but that comes with a lot of communication.
