- en: In my experience as an analytics manager/mentor, I often get this question.
    We handle a quantum of new projects in the analytics and data science space. **Problem
    definition and solution development are key ingredients of being a consultant**.
    Structuring the problem definition phase is critical to project success but may
    seem like a creative process.

- en: The start is often the toughest and business **frameworks can help make project
    kick-offs and ad-hoc analytics easier**. A lot can be achieved by starting with
    one or more frameworks and then customizing them. There is a high chance that
    your clients are aware of these and hence consuming the analytical piece is easier.
    Story-telling also becomes easier.

    favorite root-cause framework. This framework can be effectively leveraged for

    over the years. On further analysis we find that offline channel has decreasing
    contribution. Basis these customer behavior patterns, your organization decides
    to **divert marketing budget from offline to online**. Offline spends have to
    be reduced by a third and you need to decide how to still keep the lift maximum
    possible.

- en: We use Pareto next - **Pareto is among the most intuitive frameworks**, with
    focus on the concept of 'Vital Few'. Though it is also called the 80-20 rule,
    i.e. 20% of drivers should cover 80% of the values, feel free to- change the numeric
    thresholds.

    business frameworks can be leveraged in analytics and in other walks of life.
    Some of my earliest interviews were cracked through a BCG as part of a self-analytics,
    with my 'Personal life' as a star, 'academics' as my cash cow, My 'clean' cupboard
    (sarcastically of-course!) as my dog, and professional career as my question mark.
