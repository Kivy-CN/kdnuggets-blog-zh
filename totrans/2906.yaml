    While some may think there is no harm, a true "Data Scientist" must understand
    the distinction between the two.

- en: Statistical modelling is a method of mathematically approximating the world.
    Statistical models contain variables that can be used to explain relationships
    between other variables. We use hypothesis testing, confidence intervals etc to
    make inferences and validate our hypothesis.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The classic example is Regression in which we take a single or number of variables
    to find the effect of each explanatory variable to the independent variable.

    diagnostics etc, to make inferences.

- en: We use statistical models to find insights given a particular set of data. We
    can conduct modelling on a relatively small set of data just to try and understand
    the underlying nature of the data.

- en: Inherently all statistical models are wrong or not perfect. They are used to
    approximate reality. Sometimes the underlying assumptions of the model are far
    too strict and not representative of reality.

- en: Machine Learning is the method of teaching the computer to learn like humans.
    This learning has more capacity than humans so when we have an enormous amount
    of data that is beyond a normal person's comprehension or capacity to understand
    the patterns in the data, the computational and storage power of computers can
    outshine a human.

    by how well it generalizes to new data that is has not learned yet.

    we do not make the model overfit (memorize) or underfit (not enough data to learn)

    ''Classification'', ''Regression'', ''Clustering'' or ''Supervised'' and ''Unsupervised''.
    We can use error measures such as RMSE, MSE etc for regression and True Positive,
    False Positive etc for classification problems.'

- en: One cannot be done without the other. A true "Data Scientist" needs to have
    both in their arsenal. Machine learning foundations are from statistical theory
    and learning. At times it may seem Machine Learning can be done these days without
    a sound statistical background but those people are not really understanding the
    different nuances. Code written to make it easier does not negate the need for
    an in-depth understanding of the problem.

    problem at hand without machine learning coming into the picture.
