- en: Whether you’ve already squeezed your way into the data science world or you’re
    looking to do it, data science is one of the best industries to get into without
    a formal education in data science. If you can build up the skills and knowledge
    that the job requires without getting an official degree, most tech companies
    are happy for you to prove it in a technical interview and then hire you.

- en: Every day, about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created and by 2025 175 zettabytes
    of data. This horde of information contains powerful insights that can help drive
    change across the world, from reducing carbon emissions to maximizing a company’s
    profits. Data science is about trying to make sense of the numbers and produce
    actionable insights that help the organization. A data scientist could analyze
    the results of an A/B experiment in order to optimize the user’s experience or
    could determine which ad campaigns or combinations increase sales of a product
    more.

    digestible reports for their non-tech colleagues. Data scientists occupy themselves
    with the entire data science life cycle. Data scientists build data pipelines,
    combining various data sources in order to collect the necessary information.
    Then, they clean the data to prepare it for analysis. Statistical analysis is
    used to extract aggregate information from the data.

- en: Sometimes data scientists also build machine learning models, and when they
    do, they also have to evaluate, deploy, and maintain those machine learning models
    to expand their impact and relevance. Data scientists are also responsible for
    taking all of these learnings from the data and convey them to non-technical parties
    in the form of visualizations and action items. This delivery can be in the form
    of a visual, report, dashboard, or presentation.

    finding the median of a data set, developing machine learning models, or identifying
    whether the treatment of an A/B experiment had a significant impact on a metric,
    you’ll need to have a masterful grasp of statistics, probability, and linear algebra.

    A/B experiments. You will need to answer questions like, how big does the sample
    size need to be to prove the results are significant? Mean, variance, and standard
    deviation, as well as concepts like a population and sample are critical parts
    of extracting significant meaning from data. You should be familiar with both
    descriptive and inferential statistics.

    your models. If you can predict how likely a user is to respond to an ad, this
    knowledge is a lot more useful if the prediction can be made live and is accessible
    via an API call. Instead of just giving your company’s project managers an idea
    of which areas to develop next, you can tailor the product to maximize engagement,
    purchases, retention, etc for each end user. Providing live predictions allows
    you to integrate data science into the product.

    looking at images of slides from CT scans or grocery store receipts, the numbers
    you pull out of those data sets and the different attributes for those datasets
    could mean very different things. You should aim to become an expert on the source
    of your data, as this contextual knowledge will help guide you down the right
    path for your analyses. This knowledge will also help you identify and challenge
    your assumptions, or at the very least account for them.

    teams, departments, and even the company. Knowing the business is just as important
    as knowing the technical things in order to communicate successfully with non-technical
    individuals. Your job as a data scientist is to extract the value of your organization’s
    data to improve the product, the company’s processes, and the lives of its employees.
    Find ways to communicate your findings so that those around you understand the
    significance and what to do about them.

    important tool when it comes to helping people understand complex concepts. Pair
    down all of these complicated, intricate results and models into the most important
    items that are under the control of the company. You may have spent a lot of effort
    normalizing your data set and controlling for myriad factors, but the part that
    matters is what these numbers and equations mean for the people trying to improve
    the product or service for the end user.

    work. Mathematical analysis and coding are often thought of as the most important
    tasks for a data scientist, but being able to communicate the significance of
    these findings and what should be done to nudge the needle in the right direction
    is just as important. A data scientist’s ultimate responsibility is to make the
    data valuable to the company, and the only way to do that is to extract insights
    that can be made into contained, measurable action items that can be tracked with
    metrics. Be a champion of data-driven decisions and prove to your organization
    the value of driving the improvement of the product, internal processes, and practically
    anything through data science.
