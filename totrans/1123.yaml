- en: When choosing a new analytics platform, one of the most important decisions
    you can make is where the platform and your data will be hosted — in a third-party’s
    cloud, or on your own infrastructure. Cloud-hosted analytics are usually the norm
    and some enable you to get started quickly, yet a growing number of teams are
    instead choosing to self-host with platforms such as PostHog.

    to traditional cloud deployments.

- en: Unlike cloud-hosted solutions, which rely on third-party cookies, self-hosted
    solutions collect data directly from the user. This means they’re able to collect
    more usable data and better quality data because they aren’t disrupted by ad blockers
    or privacy features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With an estimated 45% of consumers using ad blockers, self-hosting has become
    critical for modern, data-led businesses. Some teams who run multiple analytics
    platforms concurrently see +50% more data captured by their self-hosted PostHog
    deployment!

- en: Cloud-hosted services can be a convenient way to deploy and are especially helpful
    if you don’t want to manage the operational side of your hosting. Sometimes though,
    it can be helpful to have direct control of things like when updates install or
    data retention policies.
  prefs: []

- en: Open-source platforms such as PostHog offer even more control too. Users such
    as Lleo Harress, Software Engineer at MentionMe have built out an entire stack
    around their self-hosted deployment since launching PostHog earlier this year.

- en: Deploying onto your own infrastructure doesn’t just mean you’re able to get
    better data - it also means you retain full control over how that data is secured.
    There are no third-party services to audit; no additional compliance or security
    certifications to complete. Your data stays on your systems.

    deal with sensitive data,” said Rikin Kachhia, Software Engineer at Hasura. “Self-hosting
    on PostHog just took that problem away.”
