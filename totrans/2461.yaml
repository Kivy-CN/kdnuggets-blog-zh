    answer depends on many factors like the problem statement and the kind of output
    you want, type and size of the data, the available computational time, number
    of features, and observations in the data, to name a few.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here are some important considerations while choosing an algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Size of the Training Data
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is usually recommended to gather a good amount of data to get reliable predictions.
    However, many a time, the availability of data is a constraint. So, if the training
    data is smaller or if the dataset has a fewer number of observations and a higher
    number of features like genetics or textual data, choose algorithms with high
    bias/low variance like Linear regression, Naïve Bayes, or Linear SVM.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the training data is sufficiently large and the number of observations is
    higher as compared to the number of features, one can go for low bias/high variance
    algorithms like KNN, Decision trees, or kernel SVM.

- en: 2\. Accuracy and/or Interpretability of the Output
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Accuracy of a model means that the function predicts a response value for a
    given observation, which is close to the true response value for that observation.
    A highly interpretable algorithm (restrictive models like Linear Regression) means
    that one can easily understand how any individual predictor is associated with
    the response while the flexible models give higher accuracy at the cost of low
    interpretability.

- en: Some algorithms are called Restrictive because they produce a small range of
    shapes of the mapping function. For example, linear regression is a restrictive
    approach because it can only generate linear functions such as the lines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some algorithms are called flexible because they can generate a wider range
    of possible shapes of the mapping function. For example, KNN with k=1 is highly
    flexible as it will consider every input data point to generate the mapping output
    function. The below picture displays the trade-off between flexible and restrictive
    algorithms.

- en: Now, to use which algorithm depends on the objective of the business problem.
    If inference is the goal, then restrictive models are better as they are much
    more interpretable. Flexible models are better if higher accuracy is the goal.
    In general, as the flexibility of a method increases, its interpretability decreases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Speed or Training Time
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Higher accuracy typically means higher training time. Also, algorithms require
    more time to train on large training data. In real-world applications, the choice
    of algorithm is driven by these two factors predominantly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Algorithms like Naïve Bayes and Linear and Logistic regression are easy to implement
    and quick to run. Algorithms like SVM, which involve tuning of parameters, Neural
    networks with high convergence time, and random forests, need a lot of time to
    train the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Linearity
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many algorithms work on the assumption that classes can be separated by a straight
    line (or its higher-dimensional analog). Examples include logistic regression
    and support vector machines. Linear regression algorithms assume that data trends
    follow a straight line. If the data is linear, then these algorithms perform quite
    good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, not always is the data is linear, so we require other algorithms which
    can handle high dimensional and complex data structures. Examples include kernel
    SVM, random forest, neural nets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best way to find out the linearity is to either fit a linear line or run
    a logistic regression or SVM and check for residual errors. A higher error means
    the data is not linear and would need complex algorithms to fit.

- en: 5\. Number of Features
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The dataset may have a large number of features that may not all be relevant
    and significant. For a certain type of data, such as genetics or textual, the
    number of features can be very large compared to the number of data points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A large number of features can bog down some learning algorithms, making training
    time unfeasibly long. SVM is better suited in case of data with large feature
    space and lesser observations. PCA and feature selection techniques should be
    used to reduce dimensionality and select important features.

    performances to choose the best one for your specific task. Also, try ensemble
    methods as they generally provide much better accuracy.
