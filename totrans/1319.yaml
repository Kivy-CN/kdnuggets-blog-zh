    data scientists. The much more likely outcome — and one that's already happening
    — is that data automation will enhance how scientists spend their time and improve
    the results they get. Here are five ways it can help.

    However, the less-exciting but all-important tasks, like compiling, cleaning and
    formatting the information, can occupy more space in a project timeline than people
    realize at first. Investing in automation can make a data science team more productive
    and agile.

    it took longer than desired to get crucial insights. They supplemented the work
    with automation. Before making that change, the company completed one to two projects
    every three months. Adding automation [allowed them to finish 10 times](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-automation-speeds-up-data-science-projects/)
    that amount in the same timeframe.

    to hire scientists. On the contrary, automated tools will offer [more time to
    spend on duties](https://www.cdotrends.com/story/15059/why-automation-will-not-kill-data-science-jobs)
    that bring the most value to a company.

    in the right format, a data professional could use their judgment to analyze results
    or focus on creating algorithms that help a business track trends.

    and experience. They also may not detect errors that could cause unreliable results.
    Data science automation excels with repetitive tasks that do not require human
    knowledge. That approach frees people to use their skills in personally rewarding
    ways that also benefit their employers.

    almost every industry that used it.

    sent global notifications](https://trifectaclinical.com/the-case-for-a-cloud-based-safety-letter-notification-system/)
    about drug safety events based on regulations in a given nation. The rise of cloud
    computing has also spurred the adoption of automated systems for working with
    data.

    market from 2016-2022, [the sector will grow to $6.23 billion](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/automation-as-a-service-market-57656106.html)
    by the end of the period and achieve a combined annual growth rate of 28.1%. The
    analysts cited cloud computing as a significant driver of the increase. For example,
    if a data scientist uses an automation-as-a-service tool to cut down on manual
    tasks, they could likely do it via the cloud and get work done anywhere.

    projects fail. This happens for a variety of reasons, including siloed data and
    skill shortages.

    upcoming or current initiatives every chance of success. For example, it can help
    people test hypotheses faster, thereby ruling out the incorrect ones more efficiently.

    strive for continuous improvement. As mentioned in an earlier point, automated
    technology helps speed up project completion.
  prefs: []

    most repetitive tasks, data scientists can use their brainpower and experience
    to take corrective action when it seems a project might fail.

    approach often causes errors. Thus, some experts advocate for so-called augmented
    intelligence. It combines artificial intelligence (AI) with human knowledge.

    of customer comments for an annual survey. The algorithms achieved an average
    accuracy rate of 90%, but it fell to 60% in some categories. The business compensated
    by implementing human expertise for the groupings with low confidence scores.
    This approach increased accuracy and led to trusted results.
