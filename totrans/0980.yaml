    programming language, it would be difficult to argue that, along with R and SQL,
    Python is not one of the top 3.

- en: Regardless of the exact rank of the language, there is no denying that Python
    is a useful tool for implementing data science in practice. Its ecosystem provides
    a rich tapestry of libraries covering the entire spectrum of data science pipelines
    and related data processing and analysis tasks. Knowing data science, Python,
    and their intersection is a fantastic way to ensure your usefulness as a data
    scientist.

    to coding and analyzing data with Python using tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The course is hands-on by design, takes learning step by step, and provides
    a strong foundation in Python language concepts as it goes. Data science concepts
    are covered along the way, and are focused on more exclusively in the final sections
    of the course. A final course project looking at COVID trend analysis is undertaken
    using the Python tools you've learned along the way.

    beginners, and that it will help you learn Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
    As far as I can tell, it seems to hold its promise. If you are looking to learn
    Python and data science, checking it out in depth would be worth your time.
