- en: Generalized Linear Model (GLM) helps represent the dependent variable as a linear
    combination of independent variables. Simple linear regression is the traditional
    form of GLM. Simple linear regression works well when the dependent variable is
    normally distributed. The assumption of normally distributed dependent variable
    is often violated in real situations. For example, consider a case where dependent
    variable can take only positive values and has fat tail. The dependent variable
    is number of coffee sold and the independent variable is the temperature.

- en: Let's assume that we have modeled a linear relationship between the variables.
    The expected number of coffee sold decreases by 10 units as temperature increases
    by 1 degree. The problem with this kind of model is that it can give meaningless
    results. There will be situation when a increase of 1 degree in temperature would
    force the model to output negative number for number of coffee sold. GLM comes
    in handy in these types of situations. GLM is widely used to model situations
    where the independent variable has arbitrary distributions i.e. distributions
    other than normal distribution.  The basic intuition behind GLM is to not model
    dependent variable as a linear combination of independent variable but model a
    function of dependent variable as a linear combination of dependent variable.
    This function used to transform independent variable is known as link function.
    In the above example the distribution of number of coffee sold will not be normal
    but poisson and the log transformation (log will be the link function in this
    case) of the variable before regression would lead to a logical model. The ability
    of GLM to transform data with arbitrary distribution to fit a meaningful linear
    model makes it a powerful tool.

    industry. We focus on: a) log-linear regression b) interpreting log-transformations
    and c) binary logistic regression. We also review the underlying distributions
    and the applicable link functions. However, we start the article with a brief
    discussion on the traditional form of GLM, simple linear regression. Along with
    the detailed explanation of the above model, we provide the steps and the commented
    R script to implement the modeling technique on R statistical software.  For the
    purpose of illustration on R, we use sample datasets. We hope that you find the
    article useful.'

- en: Linear regression is the most basic form of GLM. Linear regression models a
    linear relationship between the dependent variable, without any transformation,
    and the independent variable. The model assumes that the variables are normally
    distributed. It is represent in the form Yi= α+ βXi [Eq. 1]. The coefficients
    are computed using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method.  For a detailed explanation
    on linear regression and OLS, please refer to our earlier article at [https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/03/building-regression-models-support-vector-regression.html](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/03/building-regression-models-support-vector-regression.html).
    The article provides explanation and an example of linear regression. We hope
    that now you are comfortable with the idea of linear regression.

    of two variables - Temperature and Coca-Cola sales in a university campus. Please

    is bad and leads to absurd predictions. As per the model the Cola sales will be
    negative for temperature below 10 units. There are two ways to deal with the situation.
    First, fit a non-linear model. Second, transform the data to fit a linear model.
    In the next section we will discuss the second method.

- en: 'Log-linear regression becomes a useful tool when the dependent and independent
    variable follow an exponential relationship. It means that Y does not change linearly
    with a unit change in X but Y changes by a constant percentage with unit change
    in X.  For example, the amount due, in case of compound interest, follows an exponential
    relationship with time, T. As T increases by one unit, the amount due increases
    by a certain percentage i.e. interest rate. Another example can be that of expected
    salary and education. Expected salary does not follow a linear relationship with
    level of education. It grows exponentially with level of education. Such growth
    models depict a variety of real life situations and can be modeled using log-linear
    regression.  Apart from exponential relationship, log transformation on dependent
    variable is also used when dependent variable follows: a) log-normal distribution
    - log-normal distribution is distribution of a random variable whose log follows
    normal distribution. Thus, taking log of a log-normal random variable makes the
    variable normally distributed and fit for linear regression.  b) Poisson distribution
    - Poisson distribution is the distribution of random variable that results from
    a Poisson experiment. For example, the number of successes or failures in a time
    period T follows Poisson distribution.'

- en: In this article we focus on the exponential relationship, which is expressed
    as *Y=a(b)^X* [Eq. 2].  In this case, a log transformation would make the relationship
    linear. We can represent *log(Y)* as a linear combination on Xs. Taking log on
    both sides in the equation, we get log *(Y)=log(a)+log⁡(b)X*. Now we can estimate
    the model using OLS. Please note that this equation is very similar to Eq. 1,
    *log(a)* and *log(b)* are equivalent to *α* and *β* respectively. Now we will
    look into interpretation of log linear models. *log(a)* is the constant term and
    *log(b)* is the growth rate with which Y grows for a unit change in X. A negative
    value of *log(b)* would indicate that Y decreases by a certain percentage for
    unit increase in X. Now we will implement the model on R using the Coca-Cola sales
    data. The R code is below.

    [3]. We observe that the fit has greatly improved over the simple linear regression.
    The RMSE for the transformed model is 0.24 only. Please note that log-linear regression
    has also solved the issue of absurd negative values for cola sales. For no value
    of temperature we get a negative value of cola sales. A simple log transformation
    helps us to deal with the absurdity. In the next section we will discuss other
    log transformations that come handy in various situations.
