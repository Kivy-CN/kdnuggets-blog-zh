    a particular term. The number of times a particular term is available in a corpus
    can help us to measure the importance of that string.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IDF is **inverse document frequency**. This goes further into looking at how
    common a word is found in a corpus - or how uncommon a word is found in a corpus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IDF is important. Let’s take the English language for example, words such as
    “the”, “it”, “as”, “or” which appear frequently in many types of documents. Inverse
    document frequency essentially minimizes the weight of frequency terms such as
    those and puts terms which are not as frequent at the forefront to have a higher
    impact.

- en: 1\. Why do we take the inverse?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is because we want to give the words that are uncommon a higher value in
    comparison to the words that are much more common.. If we did not take the inverses,
    common words such as “the” would have a higher value and we would never really
    find which terms in the corpus hold importance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Why do we use logarithmic scale?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to note that we are not focusing on the occurrence of a term
    in a corpus, it is the relevance and/or importance of that term in the corpus.
    Adding to the term frequency is essentially a sub-linear function, therefore using
    the logarithmic scale allows us to put these terms in the same scale or sub-linear
    function as the term frequency.

- en: TF-IDF sounds simple in comparison to NLP techniques and tools that are being
    used today. But just because it’s simple does not mean that it does not hold value
    and does what it needs to do. TD-IDF can be used to better understand and interpret
    the outputs of algorithms that have been used on top of TF-IDF. There’s no harm
    in using more than one measure.
