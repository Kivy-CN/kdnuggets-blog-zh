- en: In recent years, machine learning technology centered on deep learning has attracted
    attention. Self-driving cars have inculcated deep learning processes that requires
    the algorithm to identify and learn from the images fed as raw data. Let’s look
    at how the need for semantic segmentation has evolved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Initial applications of computer vision required the identification of basic
    elements such as edges(lines and curves) or, gradients. However, understanding
    an image at pixel level came around only with the coining of **full-pixel semantic
    segmentation**. It clusters parts of image together which belong to the same object
    of interest and hence opens the door to numerous applications.

- en: Semantic Segmentation is a classic Computer Vision problem which involves taking
    as input some raw data (eg., 2D images) and converting them into a mask with regions
    of interest highlighted. Many use the term full-pixel semantic segmentation, where
    each pixel in an image is assigned a classID depending on which object of interest
    it belongs to.

- en: Earlier computer vision problems only found elements such as edges (lines and
    curves) or gradients, but they never quite provided an understanding of images
    at a pixel level, in the way a human perceives it. Semantic Segmentation, which
    clusters parts of images together which belong to the same object on interest,
    solves this problem, and thus finds applications in myriad fields.

    input 2D raw image? In such a case, full pixel semantic segmentation annotation
    is the key to your machine learning model. Full-pixel semantic segmentation assigns
    each pixel in an image is with a classID depending on which object of interest
    it belongs to.

    the whole image.With this, it can not be used in scenes where multiple objects
    enter the image. In that case you will use “image detection (detection)”.'

    where each pixel is classified as one from a range of object classes. Thus, there
    is a use case for land usage mapping for satellite imagery. Land cover information
    is important for various applications, such as monitoring areas of deforestation
    and urbanization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To recognize the type of land cover (e.g., areas of urban, agriculture, water,
    etc.) for each pixel on a satellite image, land cover classification can be regarded
    as a multi-class semantic segmentation task. Road and building detection is also
    an important research topic for traffic management, city planning, and road monitoring.

    nose, mouth and background. Face segmentation is useful in many facial applications
    of computer vision, such as estimation of gender, expression, age, and ethnicity.
    Notable factors influencing face segmentation dataset and model development are
    variations in lighting conditions, facial expressions, face orientation, occlusion,
    and image resolution.

- en: Clothing parsing is a very complex task compared to others due to the large
    number of classes. This distinguishes itself from general object or scene segmentation
    problems since fine-grained clothing categorization requires higher-level judgment
    based on the semantics of clothing, variability of human-pose and the potentially
    large number of classes. Clothing parsing has been actively studied in the vision
    community because of its tremendous value in real-world applications i.e E-commerce.
    Some datasets such as Fashionista and CFPD datasets provide open access to semantic
    segmentation for clothing items.
