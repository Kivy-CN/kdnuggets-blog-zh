    of what you day-to-day looks like. I have kindly asked [Jose Navarro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navarro-datascientist/)
    and [Andrzej Ko?czyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrzejkonczyk/) to give us
    a breakdown of what their days look like with the aim to help others prepare themselves.

    from both scopes. Not only will you understand what an expert Data Scientist gets
    up to, but for those who are new to the industry - you will also get an understanding
    of what a beginner Data Scientist is doing to become an expert

- en: I consider myself very fortunate to work as a data scientist. I think it’s a
    job like no other, that allows us to solve complex industry problems with the
    help of statistics, powered by computer science. I will describe here how my day-to-day
    life looks, so you can get a better image of it.

    to face interaction with the co-workers and the rest of the team is important
    for the development of both projects and careers.

- en: It is a very flexible job, and it normally allows me to accommodate my personal
    life around the needs of the project. If a good work-life balance is essential
    for you as it is for me, a career in data science is not a bad option.

- en: If I’m working from home, I usually switch on my laptop at 9 am, after a quick
    school run with my daughters. Then there will be between one and two hours of
    meetings. Meetings are crucial for the project, and good communication is key
    to understanding what the industry problem is, what is expected from each member
    of the team, how to achieve the solution, or what the results are. A data scientist
    should be able to use their soft skills to communicate effectively and to present
    to all types of stakeholders of a project, tailoring the language to the audience
    in each case.

    technologies like Python, SQL, etc. Depending on the stage of the project this
    part can vary a lot, from brainstorming to data visualisation, including data
    collection, data cleaning, labelling, statistical modelling, parameters tuning,
    etc.

    and to look far away to rest my eyes. There is no reason a data scientist couldn’t
    follow some healthy habits. Health and fitness will help us with our hormone levels,
    with some work-related benefits as well, like increasing our creativity and capacity
    to focus.

- en: I finish the day around 6 pm, making sure I have some time left for learning.
    I check the latest trends and state-of-the-art techniques with the help of pages
    like KDNuggets and services like Kaggle, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Medium. One of
    the best things of being a data scientist is that learning is always encouraged.
    With an ever-changing environment around Data, machine learning and artificial
    intelligence, keeping up to date really pays off (on top of how exciting this
    world is).

    as a Data Analyst and till November 2021 I did not have any knowledge related
    to data science/ Data Analysis / Data Engineering. I've graduated from a totally
    different study, but I have always been data enthusiastic. Due to that in November
    2021 I've started data science Bootcamp and have started to learn using additional
    online courses, tutorials. During my bootcamp course I've learned much about SQL,
    Tableau and Python libraries, which help me now understand and grow up as a new
    member of the data science family.

- en: That field is now for me so interesting, as I've started to build my own ML
    models based on real data ! I think that data science is really the future and
    you can have some great time when you are still learning. In my opinion it is
    not the easiest field - sometimes you have to spend many hours understanding a
    problem and develop your ideas - but that is really fascinating. When you finally 
    have some results, maybe not the best in the beginning - but you know that you
    did it. That is exciting.

- en: 'As I''ve mentioned - I am still a beginner, but I would like to learn more
    and change my position soon from Data Analyst to Data Scientist. What do I need
    to achieve that? I think that will be good tips for everyone, who would like to
    roll into our family: never give up, learn, read and finally keep progressing
    by making your own projects. That is the most important part. During model creation
    you can always find out something new. Other things like tools such as Tableau,
    SQL, etc are also important, but you will use them when you will make projects
    as well :)'
