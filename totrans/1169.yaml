- en: India witnessed its first-ever nationwide lockdown from 24th March 2020 to 31st
    May 2020 to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus by limiting the movement
    of its residents. The study of this article aims at identifying the different
    emotions of customers in ordering pizza in India from one of the most popular
    pizza delivery chains called **Dominos**. From 128 stores in 2006 Domino’s India,
    the poster brand of Jubilant Foodworks reported more than 1300 stores in [2020 ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277347/number-of-dominos-pizza-stores-india/)across
    the country. The study analyzed Twitter data during three different periods. The
    first period from *1st January 2020 to 24th March 2020* was considered as a pre-lockdown,
    the second period from *25th March 2020 to 31st May 2020* was considered as the
    lockdown period and finally, the third period from *1st January 2021 to 28th February
    2021* was considered as post-lockdown. Twitter data for these three different
    periods were extracted using *Sprinklr (licensed by IIM Ahmedabad*)*, *which is
    specialized in providing real-time user conversations from modern social handles. *Sprinklr
    tool offers easy access to historical Twitter data generated by users across the
    globe*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **filters **used in Sprinklr are “English only” language, source of data
    generation as “only Twitter”, and origin of data generation as “only India”. There
    were no explicit Twitter handles or Twitter hashtags used to extract the content
    across timelines, therefore it was assumed that the keyword “*dominos*” would
    represent the firm Dominos India serving pizza to customers from retail outlets
    or online platforms.

- en: The 1st column and upper half of the 2nd column are dependent on analyst efficiency
    and style. This approach does not proclaim to be the ideal one, because with the
    advent of newer concepts and techniques sentiment analysis has evolved by leaps
    and bound over the last 5 years. However, to remain close to the objective, the
    study found the above approach relevant. Further improvements and modifications
    are integral and hard to ignore. The basic problem definition is analyzing customer
    sentiments and capturing any specific difference in emotion across time periods.
    After cleaning and standardizing the user comments, each review passes through
    the methods assigned by *texblob*, *sentiwordnet,* and *afinn which generates
    a score. If the score is less than zero then it is Negative, if the score is one
    then it is Neutral and if it is more than one then it is Positive.*

- en: The lower half of the 2nd column and the entire 3rd column can also be optimized
    further in future studies. The *text2emotion *method is used to extract an emotion
    for each review. As an add-on, this method separately gives a score along with
    the emotion category. The cumulative score simply tries to find out in the given
    dataset the accumulated score of a particular emotion category. The study wanted
    to validate which user reviews did not achieve a score from *text2emotion.*

- en: '*Sentiwordnet* is a popular module in the python nltk package which is used
    for opinion mining. This is based on WordNet dictionary and classifies a word
    as positive, neutral, or negative. Similarly, the *AFINN* lexicon is also a popular
    module from the “Afinn” package which is powerful for opinion mining. *text2emotion* is
    another useful tool in python that can be used to classify each sentiment as unique
    emotion. It is to be noted with caution that any of the dictionaries used by the
    analysts for scoring sentiments solely depends on the design of the dictionary.
    The final context of the language or user reaction may require further transformation
    to portray the business context which may not be understood by the dictionary.
    So the relevance of the output generated from any of the dictionaries used in
    the Natural Language Processing space is subject to the discretion of the study
    and cannot be taken at face value of the dictionary. A particular word may sound
    negative to the dictionary but in the real context, that same word may be neutral
    or positive.'

    from 6% during the pre-lockdown time to 15% during the lockdown period and 11%
    during the post-lockdown period. However, these fear-related feelings may not
    have developed as a result of dominos' pizza’s high-quality meals during and after
    the lockdown.

- en: Bigrams only on Fear-related tweets across the three timelines imply a separate
    set of concepts. There were covid contraction cases reported by customers from
    the delivery partners like Swiggy and Zomato who were responsible for delivering
    the packages from retail outlets to customer destinations. In May 2020, Tata Consumer
    Products Ltd (TPCL) [partnered ](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/tata-consumer-products-ties-up-with-dominos-pizza-zomato-to-deliver-essential-goods/article31527327.ece)with
    Dominos application for delivering their essential items. Hence the fear could
    be specific due to this particular service line where there could be a perceived
    uncertainty over sanitization instead of food quality.

    between the pre-covid and post-covid eras, notably in the Indian pizza market.
    It is not intended to diminish the value of any brand or to affect customer preference.
    The fact that fear of ordering pizza increased during the lockdown is empirical
    and directly relates to our post-covid mentality. It’s also worth noting that,
    other than “fear,” no other emotions have witnessed such big surges in pizza sales.
    It could imply that without the lockdown effect, pizza ordering feelings would
    continue to be mixed or cheerful, rather than entirely scared. For business managers
    strategizing dominos sales, the insights shared in this article may not be ground-breaking.
    On the other hand, the study tries to project a practical application of opinion
    mining that may be easily deduced from real-world experience.
