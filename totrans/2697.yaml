- en: Machine Learning (ML) models are designed for defined business goals. ML model productionizing
    refers to hosting, scaling, and running an ML Model on top of relevant datasets.
    ML models in production also need to be resilient and flexible for future changes
    and feedback. A recent study by [Forrester](https://www.rtinsights.com/forrester-ml-development/) states
    that improving customer experience, improving profitability & revenue growth as
    the key goals organizations plan to achieve specifically using ML initiatives.

    gains. A plethora of engineering, data, and business concerns become bottlenecks
    while handling live data and putting ML models into production. As per our poll,
    43% of people said they get roadblocked in ML model production and integration.
    It is important to ensure that ML models deliver their end objectives as intended
    by businesses as their adoption across organizations globally is increasing at
    an unprecedented rate, thanks to robust and inexpensive open source infrastructure.  [Gartner ](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-the-future-of-ai-technologies/)predicts
    that over 40% of world’s leading organizations plan to actually deploy AI solutions
    by the end of 2020\. In order to understand the common pitfalls in productionizing
    ML models, let’s dive into the top 5 challenges that organizations face.

    of the data. And it cannot be just any data. Data feasibility and predictability
    risks jump into the picture. Assessing if we have relevant data sets and do we
    get them fast enough to do predictions on top isn’t straightforward. Getting contextual
    data is also a problem. In one of Sigmoid’s ML scaling with Yum Brands, some of
    the company’s products like KFC (with a new royalty program) didn’t have enough
    customer data. Having data isn’t enough either. Most ML teams start with a non
    data-lake approach and train ML models on top of their traditional data warehouses.
    With traditional data systems, data scientists often spend 80% of their time in
    cleaning and managing data rather than training models. A strong governance system
    and data cataloging are also required so that data is shared transparently and
    gets cataloged well to be leveraged again. Due to the data complexity, the cost
    of maintaining and running an ML model relative to the return diminishes over
    time.

    be finalized as per the use case and future resilience. ML systems can be quite
    difficult to engineer. A wide breadth of technology is available in the machine
    learning space. Standardizing different technology stacks in different areas while
    choosing each one such that it wouldn’t make productionizing harder is crucial
    for the model’s success. For instance, Data scientists may use tools like Pandas
    and code in Python. But these don’t necessarily translate well to a production
    environment where Spark or Pyspark is more desirable. Improperly engineered technical
    solutions can cost quite a bit. And then the lifecycle challenges and managing
    and stabilizing multiple models in production can become unwieldy too.

- en: A scalable production environment that is well integrated with different datasets and
    modeling technologies is crucial for the ML model to be successful. Integrating
    different teams and operational systems is always challenging. Complicated codebases
    have to made into well-structured systems ready to be pushed into production.
    In the absence of a standardized process to take a model to production, the team
    can get stuck at any stage. Workflow automation is necessary for different teams
    to integrate into the workflow system and test. If the model isn’t tested at the
    right stage, the entire ecosystem would have to be fixed at the end. Technology
    stacks have to be standardized else integration could be a real nightmare. Integration
    is also a crucial time to make sure that the Machine Learning experimentation
    framework isn’t a one-time wonder. Else if the business environment changes or
    during a catastrophic event, the model would cease to provide value.

    as other steps of the production process. Understanding results, running health
    checks, monitoring model performance, watching out for data anomalies, and retraining
    the model together close the entire productionizing cycle. Even after running
    the tests, a proper machine learning lifecycle management tool might be needed
    to watch out for issues that are invisible in tests.

- en: Maintaining transparent communication across data science, data engineering, DevOps,
    and other relevant teams is pivotal to ML models’ success. But assigning roles,
    giving detailed access, and monitoring for every team is complex. Strong collaboration
    and an overdose of communication are essential to identify risk across different
    areas at an early stage. Keeping data scientists deeply involved can also decide
    the future of the ML model.

    have to be watched out for. When the customer’s buying behaviors suddenly change,
    the solutions from the past cease to apply and the absence of new data to adequately train
    models becomes a roadblock. Scaling ML models isn’t easy. Watch out for our next
    piece on the best practices to productionize ML models at scale.
