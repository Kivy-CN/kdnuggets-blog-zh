    Some of the largest organizations in the world namely: Google, Facebook and Uber
    are open sourcing their own technologies that they use in their workflow to the
    public. This has allowed the common person to utilize technologies that are used
    in the biggest companies in the world. Probably the most well-known open source
    projects are PyTorch and Tensorflow (both coincidentally being the de-facto standard
    for Deep Learning).'

- en: PyTorch is basically the most famous Deep Learning library in the Data Science
    community. It has a rich [ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) that data
    scientists can use to conduct a variety of tasks. Some of the tools available
    are [BoTorch](https://botorch.org/) for Bayesian Optimization, [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/)
    for designing and using deep learning models for Natural Language Processing,
    [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) to easily build and evaluate neural nets and [skorch](https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch)
    for a high-level interface that provides full scikit-learn compatibility.

    **both [Python](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api)
    and [R](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#r-api)** . It
    is built to perform well on time series with high seasonality and able to account
    for holiday effects. It can handle missing data and outliers in the data. A big
    problem in Time Series is missing data as the data is supposed to be sequential
    and a common practice is to impute missing values with the mean or median (Most
    of the time not the bets option in Time Series).

    a probabilistic programming library for Pyro with a NumPy backend is being built
    for faster processing.

    using Python, SQL, and JavaScript (for BigQuery user-defined functions) ***HOWEVER
    there is a price if you decide to use cloud resources such as VM's and Cloud Storage***.

    deep learning framework in the Data Science Community. Tensorflow has sparked
    many extensions in order to better utilize the library from visualizations to
    production API's straight from its library of commands.

    for estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series.
    The library uses Bayesian time series model to estimate the effects of an event
    occurring when there is no real world evidence of it. This is useful when a randomized
    experiment is not available or feasible.
