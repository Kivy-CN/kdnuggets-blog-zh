    the transportation industry, AI is now used in self-driving cars, auto-pilot software
    for autonomous flying, and software used to help drivers find the most efficient
    routes to avoid traffic and save time and fuel.

    environmental impact that this level of energy consumption can have on the planet.
    A study conducted in 2019 found that AI developed through deep learning in natural
    language processing requires an incredible amount of fuel to run the hardware
    needed to train the AI.

    most likely going to be replaced by AI and robotics. It is really difficult for
    economists to put an exact number on the number of workers who will be affected
    by the introduction of AI into their industries, however, some experts predict
    that by 2030, somewhere [between 75 million and 375 million workers](https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/disadvantages-of-artificial-intelligence/44289)

    take over many of the unskilled jobs in the service sector as well as low-skilled
    jobs in administration and logistical services.

    it replaces, the danger lies in the fact that the large majority of workers who
    are replaced may lack the skills and education necessary to obtain the new jobs
    that AI creates.

    social unrest, and political turmoil if not properly addressed. This is where
    the government is going to need to provide educational programs and training to
    the displaced workforce and even introduce a universal basic income to help ease
    the transition to the new AI-centric economy. Additionally, this economic transition,
    and the extent to which governments are able to provide the necessary training
    and resources to their affected populations, is going to look a lot different

    and highly-skilled workers being largely displaced by AI as well. Specifically,
    the accounting and law industries could face a massive shake-up as well. Much
    of the work that accountants and lawyers do requires reviewing and understanding
    large amounts of data and information. AI is much more efficient and accurate
    than humans when it comes to this type of work and much of this time-intensive
    work previously done by accountants and lawyers will be handed off to AI software.
