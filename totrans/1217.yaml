    to learn more about notable trends that improve their decision-making. It’s also
    instrumental in predicting events and preventing unwanted consequences. Here are
    some thought-provoking examples.

    can quickly hinder entire companies, forcing employees to temporarily switch to
    pen-and-paper recordkeeping or deal with the loss of access to files or portals.

    For example, associate rule learning (ARL) [gauges risk based on](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/data-science-helping-cybersecurity-1/)
    certain characteristics. It allows managers to predict possible issues based on
    whether they share commonalities with past problems.

    a system sees that an unknown person with an IP address in a foreign country tried
    to access a workplace network in the middle of the night. It could automatically
    deny that individual until a human takes a closer look.

- en: An organization called Campaign Zero uses a data-driven approach to suggest
    new policy frameworks for the future of policing. Researchers there reviewed 600
    police union contracts. The results showed that 84% of the [documents contained
    at least one stipulation](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/contracts) that made
    it difficult to hold police officers accountable.

    deaths of Black men that are higher than the national homicide rate. Another way
    to apply data analytics is to assess which officers have above-average incidents
    of misconduct or complaints lodged against them. Police chiefs could then make
    departmental decisions about interventions that could predict and prevent unnecessary
    violence.

    when success almost entirely depends on achieving consistent output. In such cases,
    unexpected events or misguided judgments could lead to plunging profits and dissatisfied
    clients.

    facilities such as manufacturing plants. Research suggests that [80% of maintenance
    technicians would rather](https://www.carotron.com/articles/preventive-maintenance/)
    prevent issues than react to them. When plant leaders use connected sensors that
    feed into a data analysis platform, they can predict when parts will fail or prevent
    problems by alerting people to concerning trends.

    improving](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/data-science-australian-minings-new-hammer-and-axe/)
    results in the mining industry. Difficulties in finding new, high-quality mineral
    deposits mean companies often engage in costly exploration efforts that fall short
    of expectations. Data science could help with that, as well as monitor ventilation
    systems at established mines. Workers would stay safer while companies avoid excessive
    costs.

    to get fit but becoming less enthusiastic over time. Data science can predict
    what causes a loss of motivation and prevent it from happening. It can also assist
    in making personalized recommendations for members.

    into actionable strategies. Records may indicate that a particular member has
    only attended yoga sessions, and their attendance has gradually become less consistent.
    The system could recommend that gym staff inform that person about a class that
    combines yoga with brief periods of intensive cardio. That suggestion could raise
    interest by presenting a different opportunity.

    end their subscriptions. If the data indicates it usually happens in March, a
    club could offer extra incentives to reduce the chances of people leaving. It
    could also predict the likely interest in a new, specific type of class, such
    as chair workouts for older or injured people.

    empty shelves. That’s why many retailers now [use big data to predict demand](//www.digitalistmags.com/customer-experience/2020/05/21/converting-retail-big-data-into-predictive-insights-06203818/)
    and prevent stock shortages. Data analytics systems can look at societal trends,
    weather patterns, regional preferences and other specifics to assess people’s
    likelihood of buying.

    right locations, such as chain stores with national outlets. The data may show
    a rapid increase in people wanting workout clothes in Colorado, while such sales
    decline or remain flat in Arkansas. Retailers could use that information to keep
    stores adequately stocked.

    relied on data science to predict outcomes and prevent disappointment. Researchers
    examined data to see whether a specific year was likely to have more or less rainfall
    than usual. That information helped retailers know what kind of merchandise to
    bring with them. The same approach enabled vendors to determine the most popular
    food and beverages so they could be better prepared.

    of undesirable events and doing what they can to stop them from happening. Data
    science can make those aims more manageable, within and outside of the examples

    tracking trends and extracting meaningful insights from them. Regardless of the
    industry or audience served, it can help business decision-makers operate their
    industries smoothly while minimizing adverse outcomes.
