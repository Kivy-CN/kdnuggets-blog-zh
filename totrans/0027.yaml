    manipulation and analysis. But what if I told you that instead of writing code,
    you can analyze and generate data visualizations by simply typing a prompt or
    a question? That's what [PandasAI](https://pandas-ai.com/) does - it's like an
    AI Agent for your Python workflow that automates data analysis using various AI
    models. You can even use locally run models.
