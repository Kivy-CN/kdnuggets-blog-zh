    Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram). 
    It was helpful, and we all were enlightened.  Thank you, Dr. Conway!

    flawed. Why? Because it is a two-dimensional diagram illustrating what is inherently
    a multi-dimensional dynamic. Part of this is reflected in the disclaimer in the
    lower corner that the dimensions of communication (audial + visual) and soft skills
    are not shown. *Creativity*, *tenacity*, *introspective honesty*, and other attributes
    are missing from the graphic as well.

    happy result of which is being able to build descriptive, explanatory, predictive,
    and prescriptive models (the outputs of data science). There is no shame, therefore,
    in noting the largest source of variance in statistical methods on the Data Science
    Venn Diagram itself: the difference between *multivariate* statistical methods
    (where ≥ 3 variables are evaluated) vs. [univariate & bivariate] statistical methods.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, I am here implying that this is a larger difference than that between supervised
    vs. unsupervised statistical modeling, parametric vs. non-parametric modeling,
    *etc*. The metric of variance I base this claim on is the pronounced discrepancy
    in awareness of advanced statistical methods in the human population. The need
    is that people ought to be more aware of the multivariate analytics playing a
    core role in the fourth industrial revolution.

    most part, has not made sufficient use of multivariate statistics. Depending on
    your discipline, this implication may not hold true. Unfortunately, for many disciplines,
    it does hold true. It could be said that this fact is part of why so many industries
    are susceptible to disruption.

    (R-squared) that continues in numerous circles. R-squared is not resistant to
    outliers, is only relative to the target variable, may inflate with serially-correlated
    data, and in many other ways can be unreliable. Even so, it is heavily utilized — in
    part because Excel and nearly every other graphing tool makes it readily available.
    While R-squared can be a useful tool, it is still a tool that must be used correctly
    (e.g., for assessing bivariate linear associations).

    challenges are inherently multivariate. Many analysts and technical professionals
    still have a long way to go in learning how to properly apply computational multivariate
    statistics ( ⊆ “machine learning”). As such, they remain susceptible to disruption
    from competitors who harness better insights from data using multivariate algorithms
    … or disruption from themselves by adopting invalid strategies (*e.g.*, the [innovator’s
    dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma) typified by
    ignoring down-market, lower-margin opportunities where future competition is likely
    to be spawned).

    provide (*i.e.*, their ***essences***): ***Intuition***, ***Validity***, and ***Automation***.
    Automation could also be referred to as *up-scaling*. Their confluence provides
    us with improved ***Insight***. As portrayed, insight can also come simply from
    the overlap of having valid intuition (automation is not a prerequisite). Such
    has certainly been the case for much of history. The current hype of advanced
    analytics is largely about accelerating insights by automating data collection,
    processing, and analysis.'

    inspiration for this update of the Data Science Venn Diagram. Statistical “bias”
    is the exclusion or ignoring of significant variables, not unlike the colloquial
    meaning. Since most people are not familiar with handling multivariate analyses,
    the danger of bias most readily creeps in when multivariate problems are treated
    as bivariate or univariate problems. As noted above, the presence of bias makes
    organizations susceptible to disruption by newcomers whose multivariate approaches
    make them more insightful competitors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Also note that the overlapping area corresponding to “machine learning” lacks
    intuition (*i.e.*, is “daft” — a pronounced form of bias). Some will no doubt
    protest this. But consider that, over our decades of interactions with the physical
    world and society, people gain a level of intuition that no ML model is remotely
    close to obtaining (*exempli gratia*, know of any ML application that knows *and
    appreciates* what salt tastes like?). ML models only know what we tell them (the
    data we provide) and model outputs will ultimately reflect that. ML models can
    become very good at what we train them to do, but they still need to be trained
    by humans. (Note: even young humans need to be trained by older, wiser humans.)
    The *context* gained from a broad experience builds *intuition*. Context matters.'

    ties back to the limitations of trying to summarize a multivariate system with
    a two-dimensional graphic. This overlap could also have been used to characterize
    mechanical automation (which certainly constitutes a significant portion of the
    global economy). For the purposes of this discussion, and in the context of most
    white-collar intellectual endeavors, suffice it to say that this area can represent
    a lack of rigor when performing risk assessments.

- en: In In most cases, there is an inherent order of operations or “best practices”
    in the sequence of how each sphere of expertise is incorporated. The sequence
    of involvement is typically *intuition* first, then *validation*, then *automation*.
    We typically test whether an idea is valid after our intuition has led us to the
    idea in the first place. Likewise, we should not upscale (automate) implementations
    unless they are first deemed to be valid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are there exceptions to the sequence proposed above? Certainly! It is not uncommon
    for machine learning outputs to bring an association to a domain expert’s attention
    that they had previously dismissed or were unaware of. There are also plenty of
    cases where domain experts’ heuristics were already implemented in automated systems
    and later validated once data collection became possible. Let us also not forget
    the role of automation in helping us collect data in the first place that can
    later be evaluated with domain expertise and statistical rigor.

    had not formally verbalized. It is a simple schema, and as such can help people
    better prioritize their workflows. For example, it encourages data scientists
    to start their work by first talking to domain experts — something that is already
    touted as a best practice. If you are the type of person who is not content with
    a list of *what *todo and also wants to understand *why*, understanding the *essence* of
    a of how things happen helps.
