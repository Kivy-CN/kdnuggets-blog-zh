    agency is conducting an experiment to check what types of ads are to be shown
    to the user to get the sales aka conversion. Or, it could be some feature change
    on the website of some of the popular machine learning course providers to assess
    which change users are most receptive to and whether that change nudges the business
    KPI the experiment organizer wants to observe. This randomized experimentation
    is called AB testing which is broadly categorized under the realm of hypothesis
    testing.

    in a machine learning project. But which ones to try first, how should the team
    plan and conduct multiple experiments concurrently and eventually tie their analysis
    into meaningful insights and outcomes? It takes a skilled data scientist to not
    get overwhelmed by the swarm of potentially bright and excellent ideas. They outrightly
    rule out specific ideas and experiments simply because they know which algorithm
    and method work with what dataset and what are the shortcomings of the chosen
    algorithm. Such skill is not developed overnight and demands a number of years
    of experience to rank-order the experiments in order to yield a greater return
    on time and resources.

    from previous projects and can prudently choose the selected experiments to generate
    business value instead of going in all directions. Having said that, it is always
    a good practice to engage in healthy technical discussions with the team and pick
    their brains, decide on the pros and cons of each experiment, under what assumptions
    would this experiment works vs fail, and log them in a tracker. Such a discussion
    will help you sort aka rank order your experiments with respect to their potential
    impact and outcome. The premise is derived from the ensembling methods in machine
    learning that a single data scientist might not be able to think through all the
    corner cases unless being asked by the second pair of eyes (well, as many qualified
    pairs of eyes as possible :))

    and the data scientist is aware that even if this experiment gives the best performance,
    it can not be taken to production. You must be thinking then why do we try such
    an experiment in the first place? Well, it is important to establish the best
    case scenario aka north star, even if it is just theoretical. That gives an estimate
    as to how far the current production-ready model versions are and what type of
    trade-off is needed to get to the best-known performance.

    may just need to run multiple loops over different algorithms or through different
    sample sets to decide the final one. But how you analyze the output is the key.
    The final chosen experiment is not just driven by one single evaluation metric.
    It is also a function of how scalable the solution is with respect to the infrastructure
    requirements and how interpretable the results are.
