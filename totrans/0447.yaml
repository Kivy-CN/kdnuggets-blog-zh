    There’s no one approach that will always work. However, there are some guiding
    principles that, in most cases, will help you better answer the coding questions.
  id: totrans-3
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These guidelines are formed on the experience of going to the interviews and
    answering the coding questions. We divided these guidelines into four sections.
    You can use these guidelines as a checklist, especially if you’re not that experienced
    with [data science coding interview questions](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/data-science-coding-interview-questions-with-5-technical-concepts/).
    Later on, you’ll, of course, be able to find your own approach, maybe disregard
    some points or even include something that works for you better.

    and thoroughly thinking about the question you just got. Like you will see when
    dealing with real business problems, it’s always better to first think about the

    carefully. Read it slowly. And read it 2-3 times to make sure you didn’t miss
    anything. This applies to all [data science interview questions](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/data-science-interview-guide-questions-from-80-different-companies/),
    no matter how easy or hard they are. The point is, you won’t know if the question
    you got is hard or easy. Some of the questions can look deceptively simple, but
    they have some catch which is there exactly to eliminate those candidates who
    are not thorough enough and tend to be superficial.

    it if you didn’t catch something. In this case, it’s also advisable, once you
    understand the question, to repeat it back to the interviewer. That way, you’ll
    make sure you got it all right and allow the interviewer to correct themselves
    in case they didn’t give you all the necessary information.

    you’re given. This means you need to analyze how many tables there are and how
    they are connected to each other (foreign key and primary key).
  id: totrans-24

    there in each table. What type of data is in every column. This is important because
    your code will depend on whether you’re handling string data, integer, money,
    or any other type of data. Maybe you’ll even need to convert one data type to
    another to get the desired result.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When thinking about the solution, what first comes to mind is sometimes the
    best solution. And sometimes it is not. How could you know? Once you get the first
    idea, the trick is to think about whether there’s some other way of solving the
    problem. In [programming languages](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/top-5-data-science-programming-languages/),
    more times than not, there are several possible solutions.
  id: totrans-59
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Have this in mind. There are several reasons this is important. First, there
    could be some simple trick or function that easily solves something you think
    of solving with a lengthy code—for example, using [window functions](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-sql-window-functions/) or
    CTEs instead of writing a code with endless subqueries.
  id: totrans-60

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Always go with what’s easier to write, with as few lines of code as possible.
    When you’re at the interview, you also have to manage time at your disposal. This
    is one of the ways.
  id: totrans-61
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, if there are several more or less equally complex solutions, think
    about how the code will perform. On large amounts of data, different codes can
    take up much more time and memory to perform than others.
  id: totrans-62
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  id: totrans-64
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to say out loud and write them, which will help you see potential problems with
    your approach.
  id: totrans-65
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second important reason is it invites your interviewer to communicate with
    you and even offer some help, which they usually do. If they don’t know what you
    want to do and why, they can’t help you. As we already mentioned, there are usually
    several solutions that return the same result. Communicating your assumptions
    allows the interviewer to steer you in the right direction based on the approach
    you chose. Or even steer you from the completely wrong assumptions that will mess
    up your solution.
  id: totrans-66
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third reason is, sometimes the question could be intentionally set up to
    be vague. These questions are not that concerned with the right solution but with
    how you think. So if you state your assumptions, it will show the interviewer
    how you think, which they’re usually very interested in.
  id: totrans-67
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The fourth and final reason for stating your assumptions is even if you get
    the answer completely wrong but correct within the assumptions you stated, the
    chances are you’ll still get some points for that. The thinking, in this case,
    goes around these lines: OK, maybe the candidate completely misunderstood what
    was asked, but the solution is actually correct within the context of what they
    understood.'

    Write down your choice. Think about what aggregate functions you’ll have to use,

    way, should it be filtered and grouped, etc.

  zh: 这在某种程度上是一个紧急点。如果你已经考虑了你的解决方案方法，但还是看不到完整的解决方案，那你应该开始编写代码。
- en: The thinking behind this is even if you give an incomplete solution, it’s for
    sure worth more than not writing a single line of code. Also, some questions could
    be really difficult, and it’s hard even for the most experienced to see the whole
    solution immediately. Start coding, and there’s a chance you’ll come up with an
    idea along the way. And if not, again, you at least have something to show for.
  id: totrans-76

  zh: 这样做的思路是，即使你提供了一个不完整的解决方案，它也肯定比什么都不写要更有价值。此外，一些问题可能非常困难，即使是经验最丰富的人也难以立即看到完整的解决方案。开始编码，你可能会在过程中想到一个点子。如果没有，你至少还有东西可以展示。
- en: 'One additional reason you should have in mind: some questions are not even
    intended to be answered. Some of them are simply (and intentionally!) too hard
    to solve in the time you’re given at the interview. Nobody solves them completely.

    better to choose the dialect you know best and solve the problem than using some
    other dialect you don’t feel so sure about. If you choose the latter one, chances
