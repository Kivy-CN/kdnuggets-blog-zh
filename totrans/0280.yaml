    year, we are getting closer than ever to getting that one machine that can interact
    like humans. On one hand, we have made tremendous progress in the field of data
    analysis and on the other, our technology is getting smart enough to recognize
    our questions and respond in the language in which we ask questions.

- en: It is a “Question Answering (QA)” machine (occupying space that is sufficient
    to house 10 refrigerators). IBM Watson has the ability to scan through huge data
    volumes to “learn” about the subject and then interpret and answer questions just
    as humans would. It aims to replicate (or even surpass) an intelligent human being’s
    ability to understand questions and provide answers.

    i.e. trillion floating point operations per second. To be able to understand,
    analyze and answer questions like a high functioning human brain, Watson digs
    through over 200 million pages of information spread across 90 servers. This data
    is then run through six million logic rules to come up with relevant answers.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Search engines often spit out mechanical responses to questions. They don’t
    have the ability to interpret the order in which words appear in a sentence. They
    look out for the searched phrase and provide answers without considering the “context”
    in which that phrase appears. What this means is once Watson is properly trained,
    putting queries to it would be like talking to an actual human being that has
    the cognizance to respond in the context rather than mechanically showing results.

    on *Jeopardy!* against former winners Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings. It ended up
    winning the $1 million first prize. Through this competition, the research team
    led by principal investigator David Ferrucci was able to establish the changing
    face of Artificial Intelligence. About four years later, Watson’s computing power
    has been effectively channeled by various sectors of industry to solve real life
    problems. In this section we list out the sectors that have successfully employed
    IBM Watson’s cognitive processing capabilities.

    to civilian life each year. During the process, they have a number of questions
    related to veteran’s compensation benefits, Post-9/11 GI Bill, etc. Relevant information
    is scattered across hundreds of thousands of document pages. IBM Watson has consumed
    the knowledge that is documented in over 3,000 documents on topics specifically
    related to military transitions, which empowers it to satisfactorily answer the
    queries of military members. As a knowledge base of 3000+ documents would require
    hundreds of human beings to read through and then organize their observations,
    before framing the answers, the cost saving achieved by IBM Watson can very well
    be imagined.

    is able to channel Watson’s cognitive computing power to integrate the vast knowledge
    base of MD Anderson’s researchers. On the other hand, it plays a key role in collecting
    and analyzing huge amount of unstructured data pertaining to patients’ medical
    history. Once these two are linked, clinicians get valuable information which
    would have either taken them long time to gather or might have gotten skipped.

    travel tickets. In a competition to be the “fastest” online portal/app to get
    you this information, businesses often forget the human aspect of travel, which
    is to create experience for a lifetime. Watson is capable of consuming travel
    related documentation from around the world, analyze it and get ready with specific
    answers to questions like, “Where do I go for a romantic beach vacation with my
    wife in April?” While answering this question, Watson takes into account the fact
    that all beach destinations are not romantic and the have different “best months
    to travel”.  A customer would not have the time to scan thousands of reviews and
    then make up his mind. Imagine the efficiency a travel website could attain with
    Watson in this situation, when the query gets answered in plain English in a matter
    of seconds!

    do is to look up the internet, ask friends and prepare a list of goods we would
    need and then buy them. What if there was a supercomputer you could simply ask
    all this and it would return you a comprehensive list with additional information
    about weather, best time and places to camp at and information about other things
    to do in the neighborhood? IBM Watson’s development platform is being used by
    Fluid Inc. to disrupt the buying experience of shoppers by doing something very

    time to deliver recipes suited to the user’s needs. Once sufficient amount of
