    a particular language is that Udemy’s strength is in the specialization. While
    they do offer courses that cover broader topics, like “Data Science 101,” and
    “Visualizations,” they host-specific instructors who are experts in the class
    they teach–and the very specific skill they teach you with that language. Udemy
    has talented individual teachers for pretty much any language you can imagine.
    For example, you can take a class as specific as “Machine Learning, Data Science
    and Deep Learning with Python” taught by expert Frank Kane.
