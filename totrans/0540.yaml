    developers who need a place to store and collaborate on their codebase while maintaining
    a complete history of changes.

- en: Over the years, many such tools have come and gone or at least fallen out of
    favor, but the most widely used system today is [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    GitHub has gained popularity for a variety of reasons, most notably that it's
    cloud-based, easily discoverable, and has pricing plans that even the most frugal
    of managers will be happy to rubber stamp. Moreover, it’s commonly used by machine
    learning (ML) practitioners, including us at PerceptiLabs, to store ML models,
    data, and code.

- en: Many recruiters and human resource departments now look at a candidate's complete
    online presence to develop a profile of that person. With online tools like Google
    providing powerful search capabilities, recruiters want to find out everything
    they can about a candidate in order to judge their suitability for a given role.
    So, it should come as no surprise that your online profile could play a significant
    role in your next job search.

- en: When applying for a new role, you want your online profile to consist of more
    than just an out-of-date LinkedIn profile and some less-than-professional pictures
    on Facebook. What you really want to impress upon those looking to hire you is
    that you're more than just someone looking for a job. You want them to see your
    passion, expertise, and how well-regarded you are by demonstrating active engagement
    within a community, showing technical expertise, and displaying a strong grasp
    of the subject at hand. By doing so, recruiters will be able to better match you
    with a given role.

    to showcase your skills, become known, and demonstrate your abilities in ways
    that cannot be crammed into a standard one or two-page resume.

    you can also start to build your network of peers and your reputation. These connections
    can be invaluable when it comes to getting an introduction to someone who can
    help you land that next job or when helping someone else looking for a job. Your
    reputation in itself can be an asset as recruiters may look to see if you have
    a large following and any star ratings and judge how respected you are amongst
    industry peers.

  zh: 随着你获得关注者并关注他人、回应问题等，你也可以开始建立同行网络和声誉。这些联系在获得引荐、帮助别人找工作时可能非常宝贵。你的声誉本身也可以成为资产，因为招聘者可能会查看你是否有大量关注者和任何星级评价，并判断你在行业同仁中的受尊敬程度。
- en: Identifying and contributing to GitHub repos from companies of interest to you
    can also be beneficial. It can also help you uncover companies that you may want
    to apply to by being able to see their code offerings first hand. And by getting
    involved with their offerings, you can show that organization that you have a
    direct interest and knowledge about their technology.

  zh: 准备好开始在GitHub上建立你的在线存在了吗？这里有一些提示要记住：
- en: When creating your own repo, be sure to keep it organized. At the root should
    be an informative readme.md file, while data, code, etc. should be placed in respective
    subdirectories.
  id: totrans-17

  zh: 创建自己的代码库时，务必保持其有序。根目录下应有一个信息丰富的readme.md文件，而数据、代码等应放在各自的子目录中。
- en: Your readme.md file is a chance to show off your knowledge, your ability to
    write and convey ideas, and your thought processes. Be sure to start by describing
    the problem your repo solves, followed by a description of the structure (i.e.,
    what each directory and file or set of files represents/contains), and provide
    detailed set up/installation steps. Most importantly, be sure to include your
    name and contact information.

  zh: 你的readme.md文件是展示你知识、写作能力、表达思想和思维过程的机会。务必从描述你的代码库解决的问题开始，接着描述结构（即每个目录和文件或文件集的代表/包含内容），并提供详细的设置/安装步骤。最重要的是，一定要包括你的名字和联系信息。
- en: Don't forget to point recruiters to your GitHub contributions on your LinkedIn
    profile, personal website, and in your resume. This, of course, is also important
    when applying for a different position within your existing organization.

    ML forums, LinkedIn articles/conversations, etc. Any time you can demonstrate
    your knowledge is time well spent.
