    low code/no code tools have grown in popularity as the tools offer benefits for
    citizen developers with little to no coding experience, as well as senior developers
    looking to gain back valuable time and effort. To help spark and encourage developer
    innovation, low code/no code platforms that are backed by artificial intelligence
    (AI) promote faster development times and increased business agility while providing
    developer teams with the tools and support needed to innovate quickly and more
    often.

    firm IDC predicting the global shortage of full-time developers [will increase
    to 4 million in 2025](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US48223621),
    less than two years from now. With that in mind, companies should look to utilize
    their entire team when it comes to development, even those with limited experience
    in coding.

    tool for teams with limited resources and different skill sets to speed up the
    innovation process and implement solutions and features at a faster pace. With
    these APIs, non-IT professionals like junior product managers or business analysts
    can develop a basic prototype, expanding the number of people in an organization
    that can build software systems.

    language and utilize AI along with low-code/no-code tools, ultimately creating
    more intelligent, personalized, and automated conversations with customers on
    their preferred communications channel.

    also for more advanced senior developers, enabling even the most senior developer
    to rapidly iterate on innovations and freeing up time to focus on building higher
    code solutions. Utilizing these tools lessens the pressure on limited developer
    teams so that, with basic technical skills and minimal training, implementations
    can be faster and easier across the board. The automation that low code/no code
    and AI provides allow for teams to address more pressing issues across the board.

    and can help address talent shortages by creating an auxiliary arm of a developer
    team. In addition to mitigating talent shortages, low-code/no-code tools improve
    a business' agility and contribute to cost savings by significantly reducing hiring
    costs and application maintenance costs.

    develop new solutions, offer a better alternative to build vs. buy, and provide
    companies with the ability to avoid having to build out their own AI solutions

    to that one solution’s implementation capabilities. Teams are also forced to spend
    significant time finding other solutions that are able to work with the one purchased
    to make up for any missing needs. Buying can be a far more rigid process, may
    only partially be what a company needs to help a team of developers work more
    efficiently, and usually ropes a company into a long-term commitment. Alternatively,
    building is challenging if a team is already strapped for time and resources,
    and can be difficult to do successfully from the ground up. By choosing to build,
    a company has an increased risk of failure because what it builds might not work
    or requirements could change, causing the whole team to start over.

    These tools can be more tightly integrated with what developers are trying to

- en: For developers, time is one of the most valuable aspects of the work they do,
    so taking advantage of tools that decrease implementation time and help avoid
    boilerplate is crucial. Low-code/no-code allows teams of varying skills to implement
    basic features quickly to address a need while providing the adaptability to redesign
    down the line if needed. By avoiding early, high code development that pressures
    organizations to make decisions immediately that are difficult to change when
    necessary at a later time, teams can gain back time with a low code/no code solution
    and transition to a more complex solution with higher code after a successful
    proof of concept.

- en: Selecting the right low-code/no-code tools is a critical step as they are not
    one size fits all, and organizations should choose tools that are easiest to use
    for both the developers and non-developers on a team and that are easily augmented
    with AI capabilities. A platform’s adaptability and flexibility must also be considered
    since the platform should not only fit the needs of the team now but also in the
    future should projects change. Make sure the platform is also scalable, reliable,
    and is one that will fit seamlessly into the existing technology stack without
    issue. Checking all these boxes when choosing a low-code/no-code platform that
    utilizes AI is essential to successfully leveraging all the benefits.
