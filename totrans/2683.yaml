    of a Transformer model entails the application of encoders and decoders along
    with self-attention relating to the capability of attending to various positions
    of the input sequence and then generating a representation of the sequence. They
    possess an advantage over RNNs relating to the fact that they do not need the
    processing of the sequenced data to be in order, meaning that in the case of a
    sentence, it will not require the start of the sentence before the end for processing.
