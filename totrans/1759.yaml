- en: Though I’ve had training in qualitative methods, I’m a quant specialist and
    have been for more than 30 years. However, I’m a *user* of qualitative research
    and have been throughout my career. Unless our area of data science has no relationship
    at all with human beings, it's is very relevant to quantitative researchers. The
    closer what we do is to marketing research - user experience (UX) and customer
    relationship management (CRM) being two examples - the more useful it becomes.

    analysis such as predictive analytics more useful to decision makers. Consumer
    surveys do as well and frequently these two kinds of research are combined, with
    a qualitative phase preceding the survey and sometimes following it in a third
    phase.

    reasons (*Miller Lite tastes great*). However, they may also buy the same brand
    for different reasons (*Miller Lite tastes great* versus *Miller Lite is less
    filling*), or buy different brands for the same reasons (*Miller Lite tastes great*
    versus *Bud Light tastes great*) or buy different brands for different reasons
    *(Miller Lite is less filling* versus *Bud Light tastes great*). Consumer behavior
    can also vary for the same person by occasion or over time, too, as preferences
    and life circumstances change because of marriage, childbirth, job promotions,
    re-locations, health concerns, and so on.

- en: Having some knowledge of *why* people do what they do in certain circumstances
    can help us both in building and interpreting our final model. For example, in
    the case of marketing, it helps us understand *how* to communicate to consumers,
    not just *which*consumers to target. There are many other ways qualitative can
    help inform quantitative research, but a fuller elaboration would require much
    more space than I have here.

- en: Any kind of research has its pros and cons and qualitative is no exception.
    One of my main criticisms is that the level of expertise among practitioners is
    unpredictable. A few folks doing qualitative are amateurs, to be blunt. In some
    cases, lack of training or inexperience is the culprit. Others just don't seem
    to have it as researchers but are good at client handling, so they get the work.

- en: Unexamined assumptions is another pet peeve of mine, and qualitative researchers
    seem more prone to this than quantitative researchers. A third criticism often
    leveled by "quants" is that analysts sometimes draw quite strong conclusions based
    on their own intuition rather than evidence. Treating speculation as fact is a
    cognitive error we all make, but I encounter this more among qualitative researchers.

    with... sweeping generalizations!

    as an exploratory tool and conclusions and implications should be more tempered
    than in quantitative research. However, even with this limitation it can be invaluable
    in helping design and interpret quantitative studies and uncovering insights no
    quantitative method is able to.'
