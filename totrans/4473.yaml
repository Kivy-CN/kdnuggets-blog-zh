- en: The goal of this book is to provide an Informatics-oriented introduction to
    programming. The primary difference between a computer science approach and the
    Informatics approach taken in this book is a greater focus on using Python to
    solve data analysis problems common in the world of Informatics.

- en: First off, you should know that Python for Everybody uses Python 3, though an
    older version of the book using Python 2 is still available should you, for some
    reason, want to learn Python 2 (you should [definitely not want to do so](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/),
    however). It is also code-centric, not spending much time on programming theory
    but rather jumping right to implementation.

- en: Simply put, Python For Everybody teaches you what you need to know about Python
    to get writing practically useful code right now, particularly from a data analysis
    perspective.

    states the following:'

- en: I have not found a better beginner Python book out there. Plus, now that I am
    a professional Python programmer, I find myself constantly referring to this book
    to clarify certain points and reinforce understanding of basic principles. (I
    may be a professional, but I'm still a rookie.) I've purchased a few fat, expensive
    Python programming books with animals on the cover, but these tend to collect
    dust. In short, I have a new-found appreciation for this book and how much work
    went in to writing it. Thanks, Professor Severance!

- en: And it's not the only positive review; 448 ratings of the book with an average
    of 4.6 out of 5 should tell you that many others have also found Python for Everybody
    useful. The consensus seems to be that the book quickly covers concepts, does
    so in an easily understandable manner, and jumps right into the corresponding
    code.
