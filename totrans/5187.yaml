- en: After writing [The Most In-Demand Skills for Data Scientists in 2021](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/04/most-demand-skills-data-scientists.html),
    I wanted to replicate the same analysis for data engineers as it is increasing
    in demand at a rapid pace. According to [Interview Query’s Data Science Interview
    report](https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-data-science-interview-report), the
    number of data science interviews only grew by 10% from 2019 to 2020, while the **number
    of data engineering interviews grew by 40%** in the same period of time!

    articles that he wrote back in 2018/2019\. I’m writing this simply because I wanted
    to get a more up-to-date analysis of what skills are in demand today, and I’m
    sharing this because I’m assuming that there are people out there that also want
    to see an updated version of the most in-demand skills for data engineers in 2021.

    from web scraping job postings are not a perfect correlation to what data science
    skills are actually most demanded. However, I think this gives a good indication
    of what general skills you should focus more on, and likewise, stray away from.

    Indeed, Monster, and SimplyHired. I didn’t web scrape LinkedIn because I ran into
    Captcha issues trying to scrape it.

    them over the total number of data engineer job postings to get a percentage.
    For example, Python’s value of 0.76 means that 76% of the total job postings had
    Python in them.

    scientist analysis to see how the two roles differed.

    for data engineers vs. data scientists: One, the % of jobs that require SQL is
    much higher for data engineers — this makes sense because SQL is required to build
    data pipelines, table views, etc. Two, the % of jobs that require R for data engineers
    is much smaller. And so, if you’re someone that wants to keep both doors open
    (data engineers and data scientists), then I’d recommend learning Python instead
    of R.'

    Hive, and Hadoop are much more important for data engineers than data scientists,
    which makes sense because a data engineer’s job is focused on building and maintaining
    an organization’s data infrastructure. Airflow is also much more important for
    a data engineer, as it is slowly becoming the go-to technology for workflow scheduling.

    on data modeling and data analysis, which is more in the realm of a data scientist

    decision for choosing to learn one skill over another solely based on this resource,
    but as I said before, I think this gives a good idea as to what is increasing
    and decreasing in importance.
