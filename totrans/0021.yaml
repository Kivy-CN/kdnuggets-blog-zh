    first job in AI or make the transition into the field. However, automation that
    comes with AI advancements is putting a lot of jobs at risk too.

- en: Firstly, it is important to note that the fundamentals of AI are still very
    much needed to understand how algorithms work, what are the assumptions of the
    algorithms, how to debug them if the expected behavior deviates from the actual
    behavior, the difference between sample vs. population, what is the need to collect
    sample and the different ways of collecting it, conducting the hypothesis test,
    and more.

    even in the GenAI era, let us quickly cover the roadmap to learning AI.

- en: Starting with the foundational pillars of learning algorithms i.e. linear algebra,
    calculus, statistics, and probability, you will be equipped with understanding
    concepts, such as, what, why, and how of derivatives, where are they used, and
    what is forward and backward pass. It will also solidify your understanding of
    data distribution, and probability distributions, such as Gaussian, Poisson, etc.

    including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, clustering,
    and more.

    much easier in today’s times due to the democratization of education. For example,
    all the suggested readings in this roadmap are available for free.

    as cost functions, regularization, optimization algorithms, and error analysis
    are important too.

    to code and implement the solution enables you to get hands-on seamlessly. The
    4-hour video course on Python (as shown in the roadmap image) covers the fundamentals
    to get you started from the get-go. Now, we are ready to learn the ropes of deep
    learning focusing on fundamental concepts, including layers, nodes, activation
    functions, backpropagation, hyperparameter tuning, etc.

    to as, playground. This is where you put all your knowledge to use. One excellent
    way to do this is through practicing and participating in Kaggle competitions.
    One can also find winning solutions and develop an approach to handle varied business
    problems.

    AI workflows that start with data exploration, i.e., dissecting data to understand
    patterns underneath. It is during this phase, that data scientists get to know
    the data transformations to prepare it for modeling purposes.

    data scientists. This step, if done right, can accelerate the model’s learning

    and selecting the best performing one. The definition of “best-performing” is
    done through evaluation metrics, which are of two types – scientific like precision,
    recall, and mean squared error, and the other includes business metrics like increase
    in clicks, conversions, or dollar value impact.

    studying fundamentals is important, it is equally important to start practicing
    and experimenting to build an intuitive understanding of the learned concepts.

    a right fit, which includes the ability to map the business problem to the correct
    technical solution. If the starting step itself is done wrong, then one can not
    expect the implemented solution to meet business objectives in a meaningful way.

    success quotient depends a lot on, the often underrated skill, that is to collaborate
    with the stakeholders. Ensuring bringing stakeholders from varied backgrounds
    and expertise onboard plays a key role.

    due to a lack of clarity and ability to link those with business results. This
    gap can be addressed by effective communication skills.

    depends on the data. Also, find your AI champions who believe in the capabilities
    and possibilities of AI, while understanding the associated risks.
