    Between systems like C, Lisp, and Pascal, programmers had their choice of speciality
    and format. However, the differences between programming languages have largely
    been fixed with increased computing power that allows systems to understand and
    easily move between all languages. Today, the focus is on frameworks, which tend
    to be more modern and forward-thinking and which can overcome many of the outdated
    practices of programming languages.

- en: Frameworks are cohesive sets of library code that simplify programming in any
    given language, whereas language is the actual syntax and grammar of writing a
    code. Frameworks come with a number of advantages. While programming languages
    will never be completely obsolete, a growing number of programmers prefer working
    with frameworks and view them as the more modern and cutting-edge option for a
    number of reasons. The move towards frameworks is part of the [IT Transformation](http://www.emc.com/en-us/data-center-transformation/index.htm)
    that will surely gather steam over the coming years.

- en: Programming used to be all about getting the most you could out of code, but
    that practice has largely been done away with by automated code-writing systems.
    Today, instead of focusing on how to write an API, programmers care more about
    what that API can do. It’s like the difference between trying to get the correct
    spelling of a word versus actually understanding what the word means and how to
    use it in a sentence. Since most coding is [stringing together sets of APIs](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2902242/application-development/7-reasons-why-frameworks-are-the-new-programming-languages.html),
    programmers can focus more on the framework of the system instead of fretting
    over what punctuation mark to put in the middle of the code. Focusing on what
    the API is capable of allows programmers to push the envelope and find the cause
    and effects for various coding problems; it gives them more freedom to understand
    what is happening and how it can be manipulated to create the most effective code
    possible.

- en: Thanks to automated systems and tutorials, having a deep knowledge of various
    programming languages simply isn’t as important as it once was. Mistakes can be
    automatically corrected through various programs that are constantly looking for
    coding errors. Instead of spending time going over the minute details of a code,
    frameworks allow programmers to think in the bigger picture. With a better understanding
    of what the systems and APIs are capable of and automated systems to take care
    of the more tedious details, programmers can put more effort into turning their
    programs into something bigger with more high-level features and potential.

- en: One of the most important parts of using a programming language is understanding
    the algorithms and making sure the code fits into those algorithms. However, algorithms
    can be limited by language because they are actually defined by the frameworks.
    Changing and establishing algorithms as part of the framework is much safer and
    more effective than trying to tinker with them as part of the language. Frameworks
    have [been in development for years](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2902242/application-development/7-reasons-why-frameworks-are-the-new-programming-languages.html),
    meaning they are tried, tested, and true -- a combination of thought and experimentation
    from the best programming minds.

- en: No matter what language they focus on, many programmers agree that frameworks
    are the future of coding. If code is law, programming language is the enforcer
    that makes sure the law is put into action, but frameworks are the systems that
    actually create the laws. By focusing on frameworks, programmers can have a bigger
    say in the future and can actually set the rules for the codes instead of simply
    implementing them. Once the rules are set, everyone must work inside of them,
    so understanding framework gives users a chance to set the rules that everyone
    else must follow. In a fast-moving and forward-thinking programming world, being
    able to set some of the rules provides power and opportunity to change the game.

- en: This brings us to how frameworks can greatly benefit data scientists in their
    work. All of the above points can prove advantageous to data scientists. For one,
    a focus on frameworks means data scientists don’t always need to have extensive
    experience in coding and programming languages. They can instead bring their experience
    in their respective industries to the table. Frameworks also help data scientists
    in the process of data mining and data analysis, while also provided them with
    the time to focus on the bigger picture.

    been developed with big data and data science in mind. Hadoop, for example, was
    one of the first big data processing frameworks to be adopted by a wide variety
    of businesses. Hadoop also led to to the growth of an entire ecosystem of technologies
    like Hive and Pig dedicated to big data processing. Other frameworks like Spark,
    Samza, and Flink all have their place and have helped data scientists better achieve
    positive results, derive insights from large data sets, and efficiently manage
    big data projects.'

    nuanced differentiating factors is largely becoming outdated and unnecessary,
    especially when automated programs are available. Instead, focusing on frameworks
    and why things work they way they do will lead the way to the computing future,
    helping data scientists reach new levels of success.
