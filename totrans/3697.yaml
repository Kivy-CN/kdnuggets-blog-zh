- en: If you thought you heard all you could about ChatGPT, well you’re wrong. OpenAI
    has made its ChatGPT and Whisper models available on its API, allowing developers
    to have access to AI-powered language and speech-to-text capabilities.

    is. So let me give you a simple breakdown.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT is an AI-based chatbot system launched by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
    in November 2022\. It uses Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) and an
    autoregressive language model that produces human-like text. It is a language-processing
    AI model that is trained so that it can predict what token is next.

    This new model will be priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, making it 10x cheaper than
    the existing GPT-3.5 models.'

    a sequence of ‘tokens. However, with ChatGPT, the model uses a sequence of messages
    along with metadata.

- en: What is Whisper?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In September 2022, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/whisper) introduced
    Whisper - an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. The speech-to-text model
    is open-sourced and has been given a lot of praise from the developer community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It has been trained on 680,000 hours of large datasets that contain diverse
    audios that are multilingual. The model also has a multitasking ability and can
    perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
    These large datasets are supervised data that have been collected from the web.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tasks mentioned above are represented as a sequence of tokens together so
    that the decoder can make predictions on them. The joining of these tasks naturally
    eliminates several stages that normally occur in the traditional speech-processing
    pipeline. It can take files in different formats such as M4A, MP3, MP4, MPEG,
    MPGA, WAV and WEBM.

- en: OpenAI listened to their consumer's needs and took into consideration how hard
    Whisper can be to run. Therefore, they now have a large-v2-model which is available
    through their API that provides convenient on-demand access. This will be priced
    at $0.006 / minute.

    saving in costs has now opened up more opportunities for API users. They wanted
    to give developers access to cutting-edge language and speech-to-text capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers will now be able to use OpenAI’s open-source Whisper large-v2 model,
    which provides much faster and cost-effective results. In regards to ChatGPT,
    the model will keep going through continuous improvements which API users will
    benefit from as well as having a deeper control of their models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OpenAI is also offering dedicated instances for users who require deeper control
    over their model version and system performance. Developers will pay by time period
    and will be allocated compute infrastructure that serves their needs. This makes
    a lot of economic sense for developers who are planning to run 450M tokens per
    day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    features and pin the model snapshot. Not only will it reduce the developer's costs,
    but also make their process more effective.
