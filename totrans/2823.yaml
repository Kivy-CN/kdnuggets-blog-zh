    Think AI and ML applications are limited to the technological domain? If yes,
    then let us enlighten you with the fact that both these technologies have more
    ordinary use cases than you can imagine.

    from using real-time navigation to surfing the web. AI and ML are simplifying
    our routine operations in more ways than one. Let’s find out how.

    and fastest routes to our destination. Do you know how does this app offer you
    such accurate information? All thanks to AI. Moreover, AI algorithms enable the
    app to offer real-time speed of the traffic movement, reducing detours, and saving
    our time.

    of ML for determining the pricing of our rides, estimated time of arrival, and
    predicting rider demand to define surge price hours.

    survey of Boeing 777 airline, pilots reported doing manual flying of the plane
    for merely 7 minutes through a standard flight, primarily during takeoff and landing.
    The rest was taken care of by AI.

    For instance, “*Yes, I’m interested,*” or “*Thank you*.” Furthermore, it prompts
    suitable words even when you’re manually typing your reply. For instance, if you’ve
    typed “*looking forward”,* Gmail prompts you with ”*to hearing from you,*” and
    all you’ve to do is press Tab key to add it.

- en: Have you noticed how when you’re typing your search query, Google prompts you
    with what it thinks you’re looking for? It is called predictive search, possibly
    due to artificial intelligence. Google has plenty of data about us, such as age,
    location, past searches, and personal details, based on which it recommends such
    predictive search terms.

    in their routine life, as we saw in the above examples. In fact, this usage is
    only going to increase with more innovations and advancements in the space in
