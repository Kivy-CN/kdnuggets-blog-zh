- en: Machine learning has already extended into so many aspects of daily life that
    it can be handy for us to memorize a set of go-to examples of its impact on certain
    industries. For instance, we might think of fraud detection as the canonical example
    of machine learning in the financial sector. Or we might think of Watson’s cognitive
    approach to oncology as the canonical example of machine learning in healthcare.
    Or, yet again, we might point to recommendation engines at Netflix and Amazon
    as canonical examples of machine learning in retail.

    in aggregate, they give a sense of machine learning’s pervasive presence in our
    lives. But the convenience of go-to examples might come at a cost. In particular,
    citing the same handy examples might keep us from noticing the wide diversity
    of machine learning use cases within individual sectors.

    what machine learning is making possible in specific sectors — to look beyond
    the set of use cases that always come to mind.

    more with less, to serve more constituents more effectively and more intelligently.
    That includes agencies tasked with environmental protection like the [DCMR Milieudienst
    Rijnmond](http://www.dcmr.nl/en), which battles pollution, waste, and other environmental
    threats for the region surrounding Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

    a strong partnership with the Dutch security firm [DataExpert](https://dataexpert.nl/),
    and a suite of remote sensors, the team could use machine learning to help identify
    and evaluate environmental hazards in real time — and can sort the hazards by
    severity and urgency. By detecting and assessing environmental threats algorithmically,
    the system can identify key risks and lack of compliance. Automating and improving
    that aspect of their work can give the DCMR more time and energy for other action
    that could boost public safety.

    is striving to give workers in Belgium’s Flanders region the information and resources
    they need to find and keep work. Thankfully, unemployment in Belgium is [falling](https://tradingeconomics.com/belgium/unemployment-rate) — from
    8.2% to 6.8% in the last year — but even at 6.8%, there’s clearly more work to
    do.

    young workers while finding ways to direct limited resources where they’re truly
    needed. The machine learning solution: an ML model crafted by [IBM Global Business
    Services](https://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/gbs/consulting/) that crunches past
    data to predict the duration of unemployment for each job seeker. By focusing
    attention on the young Belgians most at risk, the agency can do more to interrupt
    the patterns of joblessness and kick off self-reinforcing steps toward job security — a
    long-term boon to the economy at large.'

    Familiar](http://www.icbf.gov.co/portal/page/portal/PortalICBF/EiInstituto), a
    children and family welfare organization working nationwide in Colombia for the
    prevention and protection of early childhood, childhood, adolescence and the welfare
    of families. On a tight budget, the organization still manages to reach more than
    8 million Colombians with its programs and services.

    29,552 emergency food rations and more than five million dietary supplements.
    That work didn’t happen by accident. Behind the scenes, the analytics firm [Informese](https://www.informese.co/)
    used [IBM SPSS Modeler](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/spss-modeler) to
    provide predictive analytics and micro-targeting capabilities that optimize the
    distribution of aid to Colombia’s poorest and most remote areas.

    the national and local level to do more than process tax returns or make the buses
    run on time. Let’s put these three new examples in our tool belts as we continue
    to advocate for machine learning — and as we look for new ways to bring its capabilities
    to bear.
