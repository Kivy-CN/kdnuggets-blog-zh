    that Data Scientist is “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.” Since then, Bootcamps
    have popped up around the country and colleges have developed data science undergraduate,
    masters, and doctorate programs; my own alma mater is planning to build a [center](http://www.bu.edu/articles/2018/data-sciences-center/) specifically
    for the subject. The cost of these programs varies widely depending on if they
    are completed online or taught in person, the length of the program, and the schools’
    employment statistics and prestige.

    be one who looks to extract actionable insights from data by applying coding and
    statistics. After I completed my data science course, I covered market trend analysis,
    time series, recommender systems, A/B testing, CNNs, computer vision, natural
    language processing, categorical and continuous modeling, unstructured clustering,
    and more. I utilized mostly python coding and SQL to complete these projects.
    These skills can be applied to virtually any topic which is why companies across
    all industries are hiring data scientists who need domain knowledge.

    degree and a background in finance and real estate. Since I graduated from college,
    I noticed that the preferred qualification sections of my target jobs were more
    and more populated by knowledge of python, SQL, and machine learning. I was also
    working with large data sets that excel could no longer handle. I wanted to become
    as competitive and relevant as possible so I began to look for programs that would
    cover these skills. After a significant amount of research, I decided to explore
    data science.

    I would then need to save the data frame and retrieve the data later on. No matter
    what file type I used, whenever I read in the saved file the arrays column would
    load as a string type with literal spaces (*\n*) between each element. This is
    an especially frustrating problem when you’ve spent hours web scraping or obtaining
    embeddings from a model and you have a deadline approaching. Fortunately, python’s [Abstract
    Syntax Trees](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) (ast) module’s *literal_eval()* method
    is there to solve this issue. I used a series of* .replace()* statements on the
    malformed array to replace the *\n* and other abnormal characters with literal
    spaces. I then added brackets to the string to make it look like an array. Once
    the string reads like an array I applied the ast method to the string and obtained
    an actual array. The statement which returned the array is as follows:'

    program that compared a user’s face embeddings to a database of embeddings of
    celebrities and politicians. I used the cosine similarity metric to compare the
    users to the database in a live demonstration. I originally utilized [Scikit-learn’s
    method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html),
    but the live demonstration was far too slow. I searched for the bottleneck by
    putting text print statements after each function. I soon discovered that the
    calculation of cosine similarity was taking far too long. I read about the speed
    of NumPy calculations and decided to switch to a pure NumPy implementation of
    the calculation after reading Danushka Bollegala’s [article](http://danushka.net/lect/dm/Numpy-basics.html).
    Out of curiosity, I searched for a way to time the difference between the two
    functions and my colleague suggested the [TQDM project](https://tqdm.github.io/).

- en: The ability to share code and projects is becoming a necessity in the data science
    field. Containerization is the practice of packaging software in a way that will
    run consistently and efficiently across all machines. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is
    a popular platform for containerization. It essentially creates a package of software
    with the versions of each library used so that it can be consistently loaded and
    run on different machines. When you run a docker container on your machine you
    will not need to download the original computer’s operating system or common dependent
    libraries, which is why containerization is more efficient.

    how abstract and customizable a container is. The most common container I’ve interacted
    with is one that holds a SQL database with python scripts that run queries. Docker’s [quickstart
    guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) covers the basics of a container
    and related terminology. I found that reverse engineering a container made for
    the specific purpose I have in mind is the best way to practice building different
    types of containers. Once I have I similar container I can utilize the Docker
    documentation to adapt it for my purposes.

    The project was presented to me in an interesting way. We agreed that the majority
    of a data scientist’s time is spent obtaining and cleaning data, and then asking
    the right questions. Building the actual model takes comparatively less time and
    is not as hard as the previous parts of a project. If you are working on a categorical
    project, you will build several models and use a tool like [GridSearch](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) to
    tune the model to the most effective hyperparameters. You will then select a metric
    to compare the models and select the most effective one for your purposes. This
    type of model building depends on your ability to select the best range for each
    parameter and patience for waiting for the GridSearch to locate the optimal hyperparameter
    values. OpenScale takes this process to the next level by essentially working
    as a cloud-based GridSearch of categorical models *and* each model’s parameters.
    This makes the shortest portion of a data science project even shorter and enables
    data scientists to focus on the more important parts of a project: EDA, asking
    the right questions, drawing actionable insights, and clearly communicating their
    findings to all stakeholders.'
