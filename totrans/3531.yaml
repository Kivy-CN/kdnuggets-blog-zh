- en: It’s important to note that, depending on your application, some of these 3
    performance measures will be more critical than others. The leaderboard for this
    Kaggle challenge doesn’t take time into account, but for certain applications
    where you have to make predictions at high frequency (for instance when you want
    to predict if a user is going to click on an ad, for every user coming to a high-traffic
    website), prediction time will be super critical.

- en: This was a very simple comparison but it’s still a bit far from an actual benchmark.
    One of the first things I’d like to do to improve on this would be to make it
    easy for others to reproduce (and verify) these results. I used the web interfaces
    of these services to get the AUC values and it would be better to have code that
    computes AUC locally. For now, you can check out this [repo for evaluating ML/prediction
    APIs](https://github.com/louisdorard/papiseval). Pull requests are welcome! (e.g.
    new APIs, new evaluation metrics, etc.)

    Machine Learning](http://www.louisdorard.com/machine-learning-book), in which
    I already covered Google Prediction and BigML… But until then, you might be interested
    in checking out an excerpt of the current edition in my Machine Learning Starter
