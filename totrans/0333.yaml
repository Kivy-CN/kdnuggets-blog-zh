- en: A month into 2024 and I’ve never seen my LinkedIn profile so busy with ‘Open
    to Work’ banners and posts. 2023 was already tough, with a lot of companies announcing
    layoffs, and what’s even sadder is that the layoffs were quite brutal. Some were
    told ‘You’re fired, see you later’, and others weren’t even paid what they were
    owed - it was all a mess.

    feel unsure about the security of your job and if you should do the smart thing
    and start looking for something new. But then the thought of entering another
    tech company who may restructure or go bust too.

    at the end of Jan. 19, 2024, at least 2,215 U.S. tech sector employees were laid
    off. In 2024 as a whole. at least 6,505 workers at U.S.-based tech companies have
    lost their jobs so far in the year - and it’s just started!

    saw every person and their dog transitioning into the tech industry, with very
    generous salaries and nice benefit packages. Jobs were opening up left, right
    and centre and people were loving it - they finally found their dream job!

    more money as they were not spending so much on office space, team meetings, etc.
    The hiring spree starts, with companies loving the fact that their team is expanding!

    and Talent Resourcing - which is no shock as at one point they were very much
    needed for the hiring spree. The second majority was software engineers, then
    marketing, and so on.

    were aged between 30-40, 89% were US-based, and 60% of them held a bachelor's
    degree.

    more automated self-checkouts than I have ever before. The till sections have

- en: If we go back to 365datascience’s findings, the majority of layoffs were within
    HR and Talent Resourcing. Some of the day-to-day tasks within these sectors have
    been heavily replaced with automation. Companies are integrating a lot of tools
    and software that are being used to handle manual tasks done within HR. Is this
    the reason why HR and Talent Resourcing was at the top of the list?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personally, I believe the other sectors are dealing with the aftermath of the
    tech hiring spree during the pandemic and as we are going through the possibilities
    of a recession, companies are struggling to keep financially afloat. This means
    all those who were hired during the tech hiring spree or are too expensive to
    keep have to be let go.

    a good indication that the company is either financially struggling or just about
    to make ends meet.
  prefs: []

- en: Another indication is your workload. If you’ve started to see your workload
    heavily decrease and projects getting cancelled. This is something that a lot
    of people don’t initially pick up on at first, but the truth is that C-suite members
    don’t have the time or finances to start new projects as they are trying to put
    together all the pieces of the future of the company and how to keep it going.
  prefs: []

- en: I urge you to take this with a pinch of salt as these reasons may not highly
    indicate that the company is going through a rough time and layoffs are pending.
    It could also mean that the company is dealing with other things that they are
    prioritizing.

    I think every tech employee should remind themselves that these tech layoffs are
    not personal and unfortunately out of our reach. These tech layoffs have included
    the most experienced members, and they were still laid off.

    to prepare yourself for the worst and always have a plan B if your company is
    showing signs of financial difficulty.
