    goal of AI is to build systems that can function intelligently and independently
    much as human beings can. As such, AI must be able to mimic some of the senses
    that human beings have.

    The AI must then be able to interpret stimuli received through these senses and
    respond accordingly. Thus, different fields and branches under the AI umbrella
    are dedicated to giving machines and systems these abilities.
