- en: Networking with others who are also interested in data science lets people learn
    about the educational options that exist, understand which tools are most prominent
    in the data science industry and get encouragement from individuals who were once
    wannabe data scientists, too.

    for short, is [the largest such international organization](https://www.informs.org/Get-Involved/Welcome-Data-Scientists)
    and boasts thousands of members. Although the organization has in-person events,
    there is also a members-only online forum.

    in their communities. MeetUp.com offers meetings of all kinds around the globe
    and [has more than 5,000 events](https://www.meetup.com/topics/data-science/)
    related to data science.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science is a fast-moving industry, and the professionals who can best keep
    pace with the changing landscape are typically those who make conscious efforts
    to do so. The IoT, open-source tools and predictive analytics are among the [trends
    likely to be prominent](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-7-big-data-analytics-trends-for-2019/)
    in 2019\.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of merely learning about the trends and staying abreast of the latest
    news about them, people seeking to become data scientists need to examine how
    they could apply those trends to their career goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, a person could explore new open-source data science software and
    start working with it as soon as possible to become acquainted with how it works.
    Or, it could be useful to take an online course about the fundamentals of predictive
    analytics and learn about why that segment of the field is so crucial to the companies
    that hire data scientists.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people who are data scientists or want to work in the field have periods
    where they teach themselves. That means even if people don't have formal data
    science training yet, they may launch data science projects independently, fueled
    by curiosity and the desire to improve skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People who have their sights set on data science careers should try a particular
    goal-setting system that teams at Google, Amazon and other notable companies use
    for their data science projects. It involves coming up with objectives and key
    results, or OKRs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The objectives relate to the goal of the project, and the key results express
    how a person would reach the goal. Also, OKRs are successful if a person meets
    [70 percent of the key results](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-power-of-goal-setting-for-your-data-science-project-9338bf475abd).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A person could apply OKRs to a data science project by choosing the most meaningful
    metric associated with it. That metric shapes the objective, and the key results
    take a deep dive into the processes the individual must go through to make the
    project fruitful. It's best if each key result has a date associated with it.

- en: If a person wants to increase earning potential in a future data science role,
    one way to do that is to get an advanced data science degree. Many schools offer
    Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees [with data science concentrations](https://www.princetonreview.com/mba?masters=data-science).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One method of learning more about them and making a shortlist would be to explore
    at least one school's offerings each weeknight. Taking that approach enables getting
    details about approximately 20 schools every month, plus allows for gaining knowledge
    without being overly hasty.

- en: The [average salaries for MBA graduates](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/031215/what-average-salary-mba-graduate.asp)
    vary depending on things like the chosen concentration and the years of work experience
    a person has. Since data science skills are in exceptionally high demand, it's
    likely a data science MBA concentration would make a job candidate stand out from
    the rest of the field.

    the gap, plus put them in a position to earn a higher-than-average salary.

    for a data scientist, but that person must also [be an excellent data storyteller](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/03/31/data-storytelling-the-essential-data-science-skill-everyone-needs/#2990588052ad).
    Otherwise, the decision-makers at a business will not be able to grasp why a particular
    conclusion drawn from the data is valuable. If the audience does not see the insights
    are sufficiently compelling, they won't make changes.

    to friends who do not have data science backgrounds. They could ask those people
    for suggestions to improve.

    ones in 2019](https://codingcompiler.com/programming-languages-data-science/)
    is a proactive move to attain the necessary knowledge to excel in future careers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If people who want to work in data science don't know any programming languages
    yet, 2019 is a prime time to expand knowledge. Python is a [fast-growing and popular
    programming language](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fastest-growing-programming-language-pythons-popularity-is-still-climbing/)
    those in the data science field often depend on. It also has an easy-to-understand
    syntax, making it an excellent first programming language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: R and SQL are a couple of other frequently used languages in data science, making
    them worth investigation. But, as they work to grow their programming language
    prowess, people must remember it's more helpful for them to know one or two programming
    languages exceptionally well, rather than only understand the bare minimum about
    many others.
