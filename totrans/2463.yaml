- en: Mathematics is undoubtedly the language of machine learning. Statistics is the
    very foundation upon which machine learning is built. Linear algebra is also a
    core contributor. However, in order to fully understand neural networks and deep
    learning, one must have some knowledge of calculus.

    which could be deemed sufficient for differing depths of neural networks understanding.
    You could, for instance, feel justified in possessing a basic intuition of derivatives
    and an understanding of how backpropagation works for updating neuron weights
    based on these operations, should you simply use popular libraries to implement
    tried and true strategies for non-novel use cases. Translation: you don''t a deep
    understanding of calculus in order to classify images using ResNet with Keras.'

    of calculus is achieved. If you are looking for a more full treatment of this
    branch of mathematics, you will want to seek out some more robust learning tools.
    Here are 3 courses and a textbook to help out, all from [MIT's Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
    initiative, which will cover everything you need to know about calculus to understand
    deep learning — and far beyond.

    one variable, and concludes with a brief discussion of infinite series. Calculus
    is fundamental to many scientific disciplines including physics, engineering,
    and economics.
