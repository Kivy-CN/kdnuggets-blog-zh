    large language models (LLMs) that are trained on existing text data and are able
    to statistically predict the next word or token in a sequence of words. When stated
    like this, it really doesn't sound like much. But GPT is already having far-reaching
    effects on how we live, work, and play. I don't even need to cite anything here
    because you are familiar with numerous instances.

    processing models prior to their existence that we able to perform similar tasks,
    some still in use today. However, state of the art in such tasks is now the sole
    territory of GPT, and they have caught on like wildfire in the recent few months
    even though they existed in lesser forms for years prior to the ChatGPT explosion.

    of, and used, image generation models such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney.
    They, too, rely on well-crafted prompts in order to perform useful generation.

    new data based on existing input data. These models have demonstrated significant
    capabilities in natural language processing, image generation, and more. By understanding
    the mechanics and intricacies of generative AI, data scientists can harness its
    power to create innovative solutions for a multitude of problems.

    prompts to guide AI models in generating desired outputs. As AI models become
    more sophisticated, the need for efficient and precise prompt engineering has
    grown more critical. By mastering this skill, data scientists can better direct
    AI models to produce targeted results, ultimately enhancing the efficacy of their
    applications.

    unrealistically high expectations for (and fears of) GPT, their limitations are
    realistically addressed. From ethics to predictability, some of the major concerns
    are mentioned to ensure that the reader has been made aware of, and can further

    of generative AI models, it's essential to acknowledge the inherent limitations
    and biases present in these models. Understanding these limitations can help data
    scientists set realistic expectations, make informed decisions, and develop more
    robust and reliable AI solutions.
