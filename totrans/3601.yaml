    engineers, and more to keep track and on top of all their experiments and the
    results produced by the model. Machine Learning Model Management sole responsibility

    the engineering of Machine Learning. It better helps organizations manage the
    machine learning lifecycle through automation and scalability by using practices
    such as collaborations and communication between the team.

    of features to then train, build, and test the model before the best performing
    model goes for deployment. It is then at this point when ML Model Management is
    used. This is where the model is evaluated, compared, rebuilt and monitored.

    through experimentation and understanding the model better. It has helped teams
    be more efficient and steer them into the right direction of which areas to improve;
    allowing them for better research and overall productive development.

- en: Collaboration is a big element to the MLOps pipeline allowing for different
    members of the team to understand the problem at hand before any steps of the
    life cycle have occurred, making comments, using prior experiment as a baseline,
    and the overall reviewing of the entire lifecycle. This can involve Data Scientists,
    Researchers, and ML Engineers to all work collaboratively and improve the overall
    lifecycle.
