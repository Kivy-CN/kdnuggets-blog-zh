    how I [mostly just use arithmetic](https://m.signalvnoise.com/data-scientists-mostly-just-do-arithmetic-and-that-s-a-good-thing-c6371885f7f6#.spcfjporf),
    a lot of people asked me about what skills or tools a data scientist needs if
    not fancy algorithms. What is this mythical “basic math” that I mentioned? Here’s
    my take on what skills are actually needed for the sort of work that I do at [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/?source=svn):
    simple analyses focused on solving actual business problems.'

    but first I have to belabor one point: **the real essential skill of a data scientist
    is the ability to understand the business and the problem, and the intellectual
    curiosity to want to do so****.** What are you actually trying to achieve as a
    business? Who are your customers? When are you selling your product? What are
    the underlying economics of the business? Are profit margins high or modest? Do
    you have many small customers or a few large customers? How wide is your product
    range? Who are you competing with? What challenge is the business facing that
    you’re trying to solve or provide input towards a decision on? What’s the believable
    range of answers? Who is involved in solving this problem? Can analysis actually
    make a difference? How much time is worth investing in this problem?'

    the underlying data sources, structure, and meaning. Even if someone else goes
    out and gets the data from wherever it’s stored and gives it to you, you still
    need to understand the origin and what each part of the data means. Data quality
    varies dramatically across and within organizations; in some cases you’ll have
    a well documented data dictionary, and in other cases you’ll have nothing. Regardless,
    you’ll want to be able to answer the following questions:'

    databases that quack SQL, whether that’s MySQL, Postgres, Hive, Impala, Redshift,
    BigQuery, Teradata, Oracle, or something else. Your mission is to free the data
    from the confines of that relational database without crashing the database instance,
    pulling more or less data than you need to, getting inaccurate data, or waiting
    a year for a query to finish.
