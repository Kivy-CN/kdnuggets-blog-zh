    data projects, the data science team is the most affected. The data scientists
    feel the brunt of the two other missing teams.

- en: When the data science team is the only data team, the data scientists are expected
    to be a jack of all trades and masters of each one. Too many jobs mean that the
    data scientists spend their [time on the periphery](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-its-your-fault-your-data-scientists-keep-quitting/)
    and little time on the actual data science.

    of what data teams are. They’ve come to believe that they only needed data scientists.
  id: totrans-14

- en: The effect on the data scientists themselves is detrimental. I’ve observed that
    data scientists will quit with 3-6 months of spending so much time on everything
    but data science. Leaving creates a lose-lose situation where the data scientist
    has to find a new position. The company has to start all over again with the recruitment
    and onboarding process. It’s a situation that could have been entirely avoided
    by having all of the data teams present.

- en: Being successful with big data projects is more of a team sport. It takes people
    with varied skills, and those skills don’t live within a single person or team.
    It takes all three data teams to be successful. These teams are data engineering,
    operations, and data science.
  id: totrans-18

- en: Each one of these teams is equally important to the success or failure of projects.
    The teams should have high bandwidth connections to each other. It should be a
    symbiotic relationship instead of an adversarial one.

    may not realize this difference and still hire the wrong data engineers.

- en: One definition of a data engineer is a SQL-focused person. This person often
    comes from a GUI-based ETL program, DBA, or data warehouse background. The other
    definition of data engineer, and the one I’m referring to, is a software engineer
    who has specialized in big data. This person comes from a strong software engineering
    background.
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can see, the two definitions are very different skillsets. It’s a distinction
    that HR or management may not have understood. A team made up of solely SQL-focused
    data engineers will be of little value to data scientists and even impede them.
    A team made up of data engineers with software engineering backgrounds will be
    of great help and can take on the complex software engineering tasks that data
    scientists lack.

- en: Another common issue between data engineering and data science can be the perception
    of a poor track record. The data engineering or IT department is the place where
    good projects go to die. As a result, the data scientists will do everything in
    their power to keep their projects out of the hands of the data engineers.

    In the data scientist’s eyes, the data engineers are putting too much process
    or practices in place. The data engineers should be trying to find a happy medium
    between too much process and not enough progress in concert with the data scientists.
  id: totrans-28

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Poor track records can be attributed to the data engineering team being made
    up of proto-data engineers. These data engineers lack the experience and knowledge
    to make the right technical calls and create progress. There could be some growth
    lacking on both sides that need to be fixed.

- en: We tend to focus on data science’s technical aspects, such as choosing the right
    models or technologies. We focus less on the organizational issues that can make
    us underperform or outright fail. In an organization with only data scientists,
    it’s up to them to advocate for the organizational changes to get data engineering
    and operations teams.

- en: It can take some honesty with ourselves and our team to admit we aren’t the
    [best team for everything](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/12/why-shouldnt-data-science-generalist.html).
    Starting with this honest look inwards, we can begin to see where we need the
    most help. It could be realizing that we chose the wrong tool for the job or that
    our processing is taking far too long. We could recognize that we’re tired of
    being on call 24/7 for our model or that the model’s reliability is so low the
    business can’t use it anymore. The overall realization is that we lack the core
    competencies to make these issues better and solve them. It isn’t a realization
    that we’re not smart; it’s that one person or team can’t be expected to do it
    all.
  id: totrans-32

- en: After our honest look, we can make a cogent argument to management for why we
    need the other teams. We’ll be able to give concrete examples of where the investment
    will pay dividends. For instance, I’ve seen that data scientists are 80% less
    efficient than data engineers at software engineering tasks. By merely adding
    data engineers, the entire data science team could become far more productive.

- en: Data scientists’ work doesn’t end once management is convinced that they need
    data engineering and operations because there will be a growth period and more
    work. You will encounter unknown unknowns and technical debt that the new teams
    start to uncover. It will take effort on all sides to communicate and form symbiotic
    relationships. The effort is well worth it, and the investment will pay great
    dividends.
