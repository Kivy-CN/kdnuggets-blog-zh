- en: Would you let an Artificial Intelligence make decisions on for behalf? — If
    Yes, then to what extent, maybe your life depends on it. With all the talk about
    AI and calls for its regulation (apparently AI will kill us all someday,) I’ve
    been thinking about under what circumstances we might take away the decision making
    from the machines (call it AI). But still we use them to our advantage (as much
    as we can) — that’s not as crazy as it sounds, because humanity has been doing
    that for years already. It’s everywhere, and there is no hiding from the fact
    that it is here to stay.

    like Ex-Machina, Al has always excited me more than anything else. I don’t know
    about you, but the very idea that Netflix can actually predict a recommendation
    list of movies based on your reaction to a previously seen movie sounds fascinating
    to me.

    in which he talked about something called #100DaysOfMLCode Challenge. It means
    coding and studying machine learning for at least an hour, every day for the next
    100 days. I highly recommend to check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo).'

    depth about something I’ve always cared about. So I took this challenge and started
    learning about machine learning.

    repository on GitHub. I will highly recommend you to do the same. As I continually
    learned new things about ML, I’ve also updated the [repository](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code)
    with the code for implementing ML algorithms along with some info-graphics for
    better understanding.

    say the least, I didn’t expect this. People have been supporting me from every
    corner of Social Media, and it most certainly humbles me, and I would like to
    take this opportunity to say thanks to everyone who has given their precious time
    to me.

    fast-changing and an ever-evolving world, I think that you never actually finish
    learning. It’s just a big learning curve. The destination is not here yet, I am
    not even close, to be completely honest. But I do know that my path is right,
    and my mind is focused on achieving what I aspire to do. So I would like to challenge
    everyone reading this right now to come and join me on this journey, take the
    #100DaysOfMlCode challenge and start working every day.'

    or an excuse, find something which you care about, something which doesn’t feel
    like work, something to which you can dedicate your entire life. Les Brown once
