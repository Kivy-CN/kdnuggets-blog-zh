    Education is not so far behind.

- en: The ‘smart’ approach to education is typically the incorporation of Machine
    Learning (ML) in learning and development. Machine Learning leverages Artificially
    Intelligent methods to teach systems how to make informed decisions without any
    human intervention. This is done by feeding data to a machine learning algorithm
    which is then able to process the data and make inferences for future events.

- en: How does this relate to education? Well, eLearning involves the use of digital
    devices around us to deliver engaging learning experiences. What would happen
    if we leveraged data from these devices to create an artificially intelligent
    approach to learning? We don’t need to look far for the answers; it’s already
    underway!

- en: Individuals can be very unique when it comes to studying patterns, the pace
    of learning, and even areas of interest. Machine Learning can be used to cater
    to the individual needs of each learner in a way that is impossible to do physically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An ML algorithm can factor in a student’s area of interest, as well as past
    courses and score reports to give them unbiased, data-driven advice on what learning
    disciplines they may find interesting and what learning paths they could pursue.
    Creating a streamlined learning journey like this for each learner is impossible
    to do in conventional learning approaches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important way learning can be personalized is by adapting course content
    according to each learner’s proficiency. If a student finds it easy to score well
    on assessments, an artificially intelligent algorithm can present progressively
    harder questions. Similarly, some learners choose to go at a slower pace than
    others, which is something Machine Learning can cater to.

    possess, complete with the levels of competency, expertise, and areas of improvement.
    This is what a Machine Learning algorithm observes for each learner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on all the past grading data, course history, and competency levels, ML
    can help come up with individualized reports for each learner. These reports outline
    the areas where each student is competent, as well as the areas where they need
    to improve. In this way, the algorithm assesses the knowledge gaps that learners
    have in a fair and unbiased manner. Once these gaps have been identified, students
    can then work to mitigate them.

    can help institutions as well as its students. A [Mckinsey report](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/using-machine-learning-to-improve-student-success-in-higher-education)
    studies the results of an online university’s application of an ML model to reduce
    attrition rates during the pandemic. This involved analyzing a decade’s worth
    of data to understand key characteristics of students that determine their likelihood
    to continue studying.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Once it was validated that the initial model was much more successful in predicting
    attrition than the baseline, the model was modified and applied to the current
    students. The resulting model gave detailed insights into five characteristic
    classes of students likely to discontinue studying. Only two of these types could
    have been identified with linear rules. This study proved the value of leveraging
    ML in higher education, and the results can be seen in the image below:'

- en: ML technologies don’t only present learners with various assessment formats,
    they can also intelligently grade them. This does not involve the conventional
    approach of matching each student’s answers to a programmed correct answer word
    for word.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, ML algorithms can parse statements to figure out, with great accuracy,
    the context in which a certain answer is written and grade it on a scale, rather
    than a binary correct or incorrect. With each response, the algorithm can also
    detect possible ways to refine the answers and give individualized feedback to
    the learners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can come as a huge relief for instructors who are pressed for time and
    unable to cater to each student individually. In the same way that automatic grading
    streamlined the assessment of multiple choice answers via scantrons and eLearning,
    machine learning technology can assess the nuances in a variety of response types.

- en: Students learn the most by asking questions. In an online learning scenario,
    an instructor is not always present to answer queries and the lecture material
    cannot possibly anticipate all possible questions that learners might come up
    with. A great way to tackle this is by employing [chatbots](https://mayfaireren.ngontinh24.com/article/8-benefits-of-chatbots-in-education-industry-botsify)
    to assist the learners.
  prefs: []

- en: Chatbots are intelligent software that can give instantaneous answers to questions
    put forward by students. In some cases, these chatbots are programmed to answer
    questions that an instructor has already anticipated or they could be used to
    suggest helpful links to students relevant to their problem.

- en: Acting as a personal tutor available at all times of the day, chatbots are a
    very useful tool in incorporating interactive learning. Online learning can be
    isolating at times and having an AI chatbot can make all the difference.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chatbots also play an instrumental role in guiding prospective students and
    directing them toward relevant resources. Many new students are hesitant to reach
    out directly to faculty, or are unaware of the right department to contact. In
    many cases, these are first-generation college students who don’t have the right
    guidance available to them.

    as evidenced by Pounce, Georgia State University’s chatbot, which was first deployed
    in 2016\. The university used to lose up to 20% of its incoming fall students
    over the course of the summer, a phenomenon called ‘summer melt’. This was due
    to various factors, primary of which was the lack of financial aid awareness.
    Pounce helped [reduce the summer melt by 20%](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1224780.pdf)
    in its very first year of use.

- en: A complete overhaul of your current online learning system to incorporate Machine
    Learning principles might seem like a waste of resources in the beginning. However,
    if you take a moment to consider the ways in which ML can streamline, automate
    and personalize online learning, it will end up being a cost-effective solution
    in the long run.

- en: For one, all eLearning platforms are moving towards artificially intelligent,
    highly personalized approaches to learning, and you would be missing out if you
    choose not to incorporate innovation and flexibility in your learning methods.
    After all, learners tend to gravitate towards learning platforms with the most
    to offer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to that, even though it may seem to be a costly investment, the
    returns you get with a learning solution incorporating ML are far more than previously
    employed online learning approaches. This is because a lot more can be done when
    you have a virtual aid ready to instruct, grade, give feedback, or even simply
    chat with the learners.

    experience for the better. The modern approach to education understands the learners,
    puts them at the center of the learning experience, and also hands them the reins
    to shape their own learning journey. Machine Learning provides all of that and
    more.

    corporation looking to streamline the employee training process. With benefits
    to all parties: learners, instructors, and administrators, not only is Machine
    Learning a great investment, but also one that can prove to be cost-effective
