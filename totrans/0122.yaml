    advancement in human history. It can help us tackle some of the most pressing
    challenges faced by humanity. While it can bring about a new era of progress,
    it also poses certain inherent risks that must be handled cautiously. Superintelligence
    can disempower humanity or even lead to human extinction if not appropriately
    handled or aligned correctly.

    a reality in the next few years. To manage the potential risks, we must create
    new governing bodies and address the critical issue of superintelligence alignment.
    It means ensuring that artificial intelligence systems that will soon surpass
    human intelligence remain aligned with human goals and intentions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Superalignment refers to ensuring that super artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
    which surpass human intelligence in all domains, act according to human values
    and goals. It is an essential concept in the field of AI safety and governance,
    aiming to address the risks associated with developing and deploying highly advanced
    AI.

- en: As AI systems get more intelligent, it may become more challenging for humans
    to understand how they make decisions. It can cause problems if the AI acts in
    ways that go against human values. It's essential to address this issue to prevent
    any harmful consequences.

- en: Superalignment ensures that superintelligent AI systems act in ways that align
    with human values and intentions. It requires accurately specifying human preferences,
    designing AI systems that can understand them, and creating mechanisms to ensure
    the AI systems pursue these objectives.
