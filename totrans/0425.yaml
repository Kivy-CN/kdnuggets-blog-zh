    too. So, there must be something special in the skills that this profession demands.
    And when I say you should carefully plan a career in data science, I am nowhere
    undermining your ability to learn statistics, probability, linear algebra, and
    state-of-the-art cutting-edge algorithms. Oh, and how can I forget the efficiency
    in coding skills and being on top of every next big thing that finds its breakthrough
    in AI.

    degree vs what you end up doing in a day job? I, for one, certainly do. Learning
    theory does not suffice in data science – you may have done a lot of titanic practice
    in Kaggle and built sentiment analysis on the nicely served data. But working
    on a real project is a different game altogether. No one will ask or advise you
    to go build one among many skills that are needed to deliver that particular project
    – it is onto you to learn while on the job and deliver the work. The veterans
    always keep an eye on the cutting-edge advanced algorithms, and what are the pros
    and cons of existing algorithms. They don’t wait for the right opportunity to
    slam at their door to wear the spectacles and burn the midnight oil. Basically,
    they never get into the comfort zone of – I know it all.

    you need to keep repeating your solution and results to get approval from the
    technical panel and managers. While this ensures your model gets early scrutiny
    if any, sometimes it gets a little rough and requires a tough muscle to survive
    the repeat presentations.

    are opportunistic and curious enough to correlate what is best for the business
    and come up with bright ideas for improving the ROI. Do you need help and validation
    from peers and managers in whether you are doing it correctly, or you are confident
    with your assumptions and analysis? It’s difficult to know where to start when
    a lot of numbers are staring right in your face – but the one who isn’t afraid
    of getting their hands dirty with data gets to take home a fat package too, pun
