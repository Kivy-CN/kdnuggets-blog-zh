    Google Research releases a new image dataset, the Canadian Government dishes out
    an incredible deep learning grant, an improved generative model for raw audio,
    the chronicles of going from total noob to using machine learning at work in a
    year, PhD level graduate machine learning courseware for all, and a few xkcd laughs.

    as possible: the labels cover more real-life entities than the 1000 ImageNet classes,

    capitalizes on the unique and synergistic combination of machine learning / deep
    learning and operations research—the science of optimization. The strategy, which
    lies at the core of data-driven innovation, will pave the way to major scientific
    breakthroughs, allowing useful information to be efficiently extracted from massive
    data sets (machine learning) and turned into actionable decisions (operations).
