- en: I started in Data Science back in 2015\. It was not an intended move but the
    answer to the needs of my employer. I was working for a company providing automation
    services to Spanish corporations and we had the need to leverage data to **automate
    complex tasks whose rules could not be easily hard-coded**. I had recently graduated
    as an engineer in the middle of a terrible economic crisis, had some statistical
    modeling knowledge and was proficient using MATLAB.

    jump-start in the field (at least, in Spain) and the naturally closest studies
    you could have were, in this order: Mathematics (in Spain with a strong focus
    in becoming a teacher/professor in the public education system) or Software Engineer
    (most of them more interested in App Development or creating the new Uber of “X”
    than in boring Data Science stuff back then).'

    graduates from mostly quantitative degrees (lots of engineers from diverse branches,
    and people from economics and similar degrees). In this context I found some precious
    online resources which helped me back then and, in the long run, made me a better
    Data Scientist today (2020).
