    such segmentations much quicker, more precise, and more detailed than you could
    do by manually segmenting data.
  prefs: []

    amount of data gets collected in the form of audio files or text written on social
    media (and the internet in general)  in the form of posts, comments, reviews,
    text messages, etc. Imagine manually going through hundreds, maybe even thousands,
    of comments by each and every customer. This wouldn’t work!

    You can segment your customers according to their behavior, which makes it possible
    to create customer personas based on the blended data. From there comes the possibility
    of analyzing what the customers did or said and predicting and influencing their
    behavior. This is the level where you know your customers better than they know

    and at the right price. Based on your data, you know that you won’t be, for example,
    offering thrillers to someone who enjoys reading philosophy books. But if you
    have an excellent new translation of Immanuel Kant’s ‘Critique of Practical Reason’,
    you might have the right thing for them.

    doing something wrong if you’re acquiring new customers while at the same time
    losing your current customers at a much quicker rate. There’s no growth there!
    And it makes new customers reluctant to buy your product or use your services
    if they know you’re bad at keeping them.

    brand and if they’re willing to recommend it to their family and friends.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    defines what a repeated purchase is in terms of the number of purchases and time
    between each purchase. Then you can investigate why some customers stay with you
    and others don’t. If the trend is negative, you can turn it around. If it's positive,
    you can keep doing what you’re doing and improve on this trend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    focused on the purchase but can reflect customer satisfaction. It could include
    data such as the number of customers following you on social media, liking and
    commenting on your posts, resharing them, reviewing your products or services,
    etc. Is sharing better than liking? Is commenting better than sharing? Is a comment
    positive or negative? Putting value to such information that could mean everything
    and nothing is where data science comes in. For example, by determining the ‘feeling’
    of comment, whether it is highly positive, positive, neutral, negative, or extremely
    negative. You can calibrate machine learning algorithms to that for you. Much
    faster and much more consistent. The algorithm’s worldview isn’t separated into
    before and after a cup of morning coffee.

    newly acquired and retained customers. This also can help you detect whether there
    is an inflow or outflow of customers and the reasons. Without it, you could only
    guess. But when you find the cause of something, it’s easier to tackle its effect.
