    analytics are all around these days. IBM projects that every day we generate 2.5
    quintillion bytes of data. This means that 90% of the data in the world has been
    created in the last two years. Gartner projects that by 2015, 85% of Fortune 500
    organizations will be unable to exploit big data for competitive advantage and
    about 4.4 million jobs will be created around big data.'

    are a strong indication of the ubiquity of big data and the need for analytical
    skills and resources, because as the data piles up, managing and analyzing these
    data resources in the best way become critical success factors in creating competitive
    advantage and strategic leverage. To address these challenges, companies are hiring
    data scientists. However, in the industry, there are strong misconceptions and
    disagreements about what constitutes a good data scientist. Here are the key characteristics
    of what makes up a good data scientist:'

- en: '![Good Programmer](../Images/a991e403ac08b72f7bfb3b9ee90f6673.png)As per definition,
    data scientists work with data. This involves plenty of activities such as sampling
    and pre-processing of data, model estimation and post-processing (e.g. sensitivity
    analysis, model deployment, back-testing, model validation). Although many user-friendly
    software tools are on the market nowadays to automate this, every analytical exercise
    requires tailored steps to tackle the specificities of a particular business problem.
    In order to successfully perform these steps, programming needs to be done. Hence,
    a good data scientist should possess sound programming skills in e.g. R, Python,
    SAS … The programming language itself is not that important as such, as long as
    he/she is familiar with the basic concepts of programming and knows how to use
    these to automate repetitive tasks or perform specific routines.'

    a data scientist should have a thorough background in statistics, machine learning
    and/or data mining. The distinction between these various disciplines is getting
    more and more blurred and is actually not that relevant. They all provide a set
    of quantitative techniques to analyze data and find business relevant patterns
    within a particular context (e.g. risk management, fraud detection, marketing
    analytics …). The data scientist should be aware of which technique can be applied
    when and how. He/she should not focus too much on the underlying mathematical
    (e.g. optimization) details but rather have a good understanding of what analytical
    problem a technique solves, and how its results should be interpreted. In this,
    training of engineers in computer science and business/industrial engineering
    should aim at an integrated, multidisciplinary view, with recent grads formed
    in both the use of the techniques, and with the business acumen necessary to bring
    new endeavors to fruition.'

    results obtained so as to avoid situations often referred to as data massage and/or
    data torture whereby data is (intentionally) misrepresented and/or too much focus
    is spent discussing spurious correlations. When selecting the optimal quantitative
    technique, the data scientist should take into account the specificities of the
    business problem. Typical requirements for analytical models are: action-ability
    (to what extent is the analytical model solving the business problem?), performance
    (what is the statistical performance of the analytical model?), interpret-ability
    (can the analytical model be easily explained to decision makers?), operational
    efficiency (how much efforts are needed to setup, evaluate and monitor the analytical
    model?), regulatory compliance (is the model in line with regulation?) and economical
    cost (what is the cost of setting up, running and maintaining the model?). Based
    upon a combination of these requirements, the data scientist should be capable
    of selecting the best analytical technique to solve the business problem.'

    is a huge gap between the analytical models and the business users. To bridge
    this gap, communication and ![Quantitative Skills](../Images/53fab9fe905e223d7621120055f93d5c.png)visualization
    facilities are key! Hence, a data scientist should know how to represent analytical
    models and their accompanying statistics and reports in user-friendly ways using
    e.g. traffic light approaches, OLAP (on-line analytical processing) facilities,
    If-then business rules, … He/she should be capable of communicating the right
    amount of information without getting lost into complex (e.g. statistical) details
    which will inhibit a model’s successful deployment. By doing so, business users
    will better understand the characteristics and behavior in their (big) data which
    will improve their attitude towards and acceptance of the resulting analytical
    models. Educational institutions must learn to balance, since it is known that
    many academic degrees prepare students that are skewed to either too much analytical
    or too much practical knowledge.

    this might be obvious, we have witnessed (too) many data science projects that
    failed since the respective analyst did not understand the business problem at
    hand. By “business” we refer to the respective application area, which could be
    e.g. churn prediction or credit scoring in a real business context or astronomy
    or medicine if the respective data to be analyzed stem from such areas.'

    needs creativity on at least two levels. First, on a technical level, it is important
    to be creative with regard to feature selection, data transformation and cleaning.
    These steps of the standard knowledge discovery process have to be adapted to
    each particular application and often the “right guess” could make a big difference.
    Second, big data and analytics is a fast evolving field! New problems, technologies
    and corresponding challenges pop up on an ongoing basis. It is important that
    a data scientist keeps up with these new technologies and has enough creativity
    to see how they can create new business opportunities.'
