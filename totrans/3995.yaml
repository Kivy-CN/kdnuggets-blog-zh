- en: Image by Author Genetic algorithms are techniques based on natural selection
    used to solve complex problems. They are used to arrive at reasonable solutions
    to the problem rather than other methods because the problems are complicated.
    In this article, we will cover the basics of genetic algorithms and how they can
    be implemented in Python.

- en: The fitness function gauges the proximity of a considered solution to the best
    possible solution to the problem. It provides a fitness level for each person
    in the population, which describes the quality or efficiency of the current generation.
    This score defines the choice while the higher fitness value suggests an improved
    solution.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Crossover is a basic concept of genetic algorithm that aims at the exchange
    of genetic information of two parent individuals to form one or more progeny.
    This process is closely similar to the crossover and recombination of the biology
    happening in nature. Applying the basic principles of heredity, crossover attempts
    to produce offspring that will embody desirable characteristics of the parents
    and, thus, possess better adaptation in the next generations. Crossover is a relatively
    broad concept which can be divided into several types each of which has their
    peculiarities and the sphere where they can be applied effectively.

    and only one crossover actually happens. Prior to this position all genes are

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Genetic Algorithms, mutation is of paramount significance because it provides
    diversity which is a crucial factor when avoiding convergence directly towards
    the area of the optimum solutions. Therefore, getting random changes in the string
    of an individual mutation allows the algorithm to go into other regions of the
    solution space that it cannot reach by means of crossover operations alone. This
    stochastic process ensures that no matter what, the population will evolve or
    shift its position in the areas of the search space which have been identified
    as optimal by the genetic algorithm.

    problems that cannot be solved directly as they mimic the evolution of species.
    Thus, once you grasp the essentials of GAs and understand how to put them into
    practice in Python, the solution to complex tasks will be much easier. Selection,
    crossover, and mutation keys enable you to make modifications in solutions and
    get the best or nearly best answers constantly. Having read this article, you
    are prepared to apply the genetic algorithms to your own tasks and thereby improve
    in different tasks and problem solving.
