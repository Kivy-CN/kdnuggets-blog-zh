    data science projects is one of the easiest ways to land a job in the field, especially
    if you don’t possess a Master’s degree.

    I wrote in 2020, I provided a list of data science project ideas that you can
    add to your portfolio to increase your chances of landing a job. It’s been two
    years since then.

- en: After working in the industry for some time, speaking to data science hiring
    managers, and reviewing resumes, I have a slightly different perspective on the
    types of projects you should add to your resume.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this article, I will provide you with advice on the kinds of projects you
    should and should NOT add to your portfolio. Some projects actually do more harm
    than good to your resume, and showcasing them makes it likely for your application
    to get tossed out.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will also provide you with project ideas with tutorials and source code as
    reference material. Make sure you don’t copy these projects verbatim?—?change
    the codes slightly and add your own unique spin to it, and most importantly, make
    sure you understand what you are doing. Data science interviewers almost always
    ask you to explain past projects and source code, and it will be impossible to
    get through the interview stage if you don’t understand your own work.

- en: I once went through a candidate’s GitHub profile and saw hundreds of lines of
    EDA and colourful charts. It looked good, but I had no idea what his objective
    was. Honestly, I don’t think he knew either, as he was unable to explain exactly
    what he was trying to achieve with the analysis.
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This candidate made a common mistake?—?He focused too much on trying to showcase
    that he knew how to build different types of charts, pre-process, and manipulate
    data. There was too much emphasis on codes, libraries, and tools, instead of focusing
    on actually deriving an outcome from his analysis.
  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most hiring managers don’t really care about the libraries and tools you use.
    They want to understand your thought process, and why you decided to take the
    approach you did to solve the problem. They want to know how you struggled in
    deriving the outcome along the way, and what methods you applied to overcome it.
  id: totrans-20

    what you did and why you did it, you give employers confidence in your reasoning
    skills. This tells them that regardless of the program or library you use, you
    will be able to solve any problems that arise.

    skills, they are just to easy and common to showcase on your resume. These are
    extremely popular data science projects, and it is likely that other candidates
    would have them on their applications as well.

    showcase the same projects as 40 other candidates, it is likely that your resume
    will get tossed out as you don’t stand out from the crowd.

- en: Customer churn is the rate at which a consumer stops doing business with an
    organization. A high customer churn rate is bad for companies, and if they are
    able to predict that a user is about to stop making purchases from them, they
    will implement measures to prevent this from happening.

    the attention of hiring managers, as it is a use-case they are familiar with.
    This helps you stand out amongst other candidates who might be showcasing projects
    that have no business relevance whatsoever.
  id: totrans-32

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is a tutorial I found online that you can code along to, in order to learn
    how to predict customer churn. Once you understand the codes and are familiar
    with how a churn prediction model works, I suggest building your own algorithm
    from scratch. Do not copy another person’s code without properly understanding
    it, as you will find it difficult to pass the interview or answer questions related
    to the project.

    into different user groups. Each group will have patterns that are similar to
    each other.

    [Mall Customer Segmentation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).
    I performed some exploratory data analysis, pre-processing, and finally built
    a model to segment customers of a shopping mall into different user groups. I
    also provided recommendations as to how these individuals should be approached,
    and the type of products they would be interested in.

    of having 10 simple, common projects. A hiring manager will generally ask you
    to walk him through one complete data science project and how you implemented
    it. Make sure this isn’t as simple as the Titanic or Iris Flower prediction.
