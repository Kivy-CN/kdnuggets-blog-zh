- en: A biological brain understands that physical objects exist in a 3D environment
    which is subject to various physical attributes. It interprets everything in the
    context of everything else it has previously learned. In stark contrast, AI –
    and specifically machine learning (ML) – analyzes massive data sets looking for
    patterns and correlations without understanding any of the data it is processing.
    An ML system requiring thousands of tagged samples is fundamentally different
    from the mind of a child, which can learn from just a few experiences of untagged
    data. Even the recent “neuromorphic” chips rely on capabilities which are absent
    in biology.

    brain run much deeper, so for today’s AI to overcome its inherent limitations
    and evolve into its next phase – artificial general intelligence (AGI) – we should
    examine the differences between the brain, which already implements general intelligence,
    and the artificial counterparts.

    detail the capabilities and limitations of biological neurons and how these relate
    to ML. Doing so will shed light on what ultimately will be needed to replicate
    the contextual understanding of the human brain, enabling AI to attain true intelligence
    and understanding.

- en: To understand why machine learning is not much like your brain, you need to
    know a little about how brains work and about their primary component, the neuron.
    Neuron cells are complex, electro-chemical devices and this brief description
    just scratches the surface. I will be as brief and succinct as possible, so bear
    with me then we’ll get back to ML.

- en: The neuron has a cell body and a long axon (avg. length ~10mm) which connects
    via synapses to other neurons. Each neuron accumulates an internal charge (the
    “membrane potential”) which can change. If it reaches a threshold, the neuron
    will “fire.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The neuron’s internal charge can be modified through the addition of neurotransmitter
    ions which can increase or reduce the internal charge (depending on the neurotransmitter
    ion’s charge). These neurotransmitters are contributed from incoming synapses
    when the connected neuron fires in an amount we’ll call the “weight” of each synapse.
    As the weight changes, the synapse contributes more or fewer ions to the target
    neuron’s internal charge. When the neuron fires, it sends a neural spike down
    its axon and contributes neurotransmitters through each synapse to each connected
    neuron. After firing, the voltage returns to its resting state and the neurotransmitters
    return to their initial locations to be reused.

    which underlies most ML systems. (I’ll explore these differences in a subsequent
    article.) Perceptrons are great for some calculations, while neurons excel at
    others.

    and may count many thousands. The myelin sheath on the axon is only present on
    long axons which may be 100mm long in the neocortex, so this drawing is not to
    scale by several orders of magnitude. Shorter axons in the brain are not myelinated,
    which makes them slower but more densely packed and still often hundreds of times
    longer than the cell body diameter. Diagram by Egm4313.s12 at English Wikipedia

    KHz, MHz or GHz; Hz!), or a maximum of one spike every 4ms. In comparison, transistors
    are many millions of times faster. The neural spike is about 1ms long, but during
    the 3ms period after a spike where everything is being reset, the neuron cannot
    fire again and incoming neural spikes are ignored. This will prove significant
    when we consider one principal difference between the neuron and the perceptron:
    the time of arrival of signals at the perceptron does not matter, while the timing
    of signals in the biological neuron is vitally important.'

- en: The reason neurons are so slow is that they are not electronic, but electro-chemical.
    They rely on transporting or reorienting ionic molecules, which is much slower
    than electronic signals. Neuron spike signals travel along axons from one neuron
    to the next at a leisurely 1-2m/s, slightly more than walking speed when compared
    with electronic signals, which travel at nearly the speed of light.

- en: Getting back to ML, if we imagine that it takes 10 neural pulses to establish
    a firing frequency (more on this in the next article), now it takes 40 ms to represent
    a value. A network with 10 layers takes nearly half a second for any signal to
    propagate from the first layer to the last. Taking into account additional layers
    for visual basics like boundary-detection, the brain must be limited to fewer
    than 10 stages of processing.

- en: The neuron’s slowness also means that the approach of learning through many
    presentations of thousands of training samples is implausible. If a biological
    brain can process 1 image per second, the 60,000 images of the MNIST dataset of
    handwritten digits would take 1,000 minutes or 16 hours of dedicated concentration.
    How long would it take you to learn these symbols? Ten minutes? Obviously, something
    really different is going on here.
