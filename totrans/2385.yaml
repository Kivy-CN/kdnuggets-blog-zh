- en: For those who don’t already know, machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence
    that uses data analysis to predict accurate outcomes. It is the machine learning
    algorithms that produce these predicted outputs by learning on historical data
    and its features.

    multiple sources to bring it to a centralized single database.

    - there’s a phase of cleaning it up. During the TRANSFORM stage, you will clean
    up the data, search and rectify any duplicates and prepare it to be loaded into
    another database.

    The benefits it brings to machine learning are that it helps extract data, clean
    it up and deliver it from Point A to Point B.

- en: Yes, we generate and collect a lot of data with it growing at such an exponential
    rate that we can physically store all of it in a traditional data warehouse infrastructure.
    That’s where Cloud Computing has benefited us all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    helped us perform high-speed analytics. Businesses have been able to scale and
    continue to be innovative since Cloud Computing entered the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But your data still needs to be stored in a central repository, regardless if
    it's through traditional data warehouses or the cloud. The aim of ETL is to prepare
    your data so that it is in the best-suited format to be used in machine learning.
    If you don’t prepare your data through ETL - there’s no difference between it
    staying in the raw format in data warehouses or just sitting in the cloud.

    needs large amounts of training data. This training data needs to be of good quality
    and hold features and characteristics that can help to solve the task at hand.

    found at the base - the foundation. Let’s go through the steps on how ETL is important

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you collect the data if it is through an external source, user-generated
    content, sensors, etc. The next step would be to move and store that data. This
    is where ETL comes into the picture, with other steps such as infrastructure,
    pipelines, structure, and unstructured data storage.

    would be to explore the data and transform it where required. The transforming
    of data can also be known as the preparing of data and includes cleaning and error
    detection.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the data has been prepared and is in a good format - we can then move on
    to labeling the data for input in machine learning algorithms. This will be used
    as training data, where we will learn more about the features of the data points
    and perform analytics to grasp a better understanding.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where machine learning comes to play. With the labeled data, we can
    input it into machine learning algorithms so that they can better learn the features
    of each data point and the relationship between them. During this phase, there
    will be a lot of experimentations and A/B testing to understand the limitations
    of the data and its performance.

- en: As you can see, ETL was one of the first steps in the machine learning algorithm
    process - that’s why I referred to it as the foundation. If you missed out on
    ETL, you will find yourself going back and forth to rectify the errors and problems
    in your data which will produce inaccurate outputs once inputted into the machine
    learning algorithm.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Although they use the same words, they differ.
  prefs: []

- en: ETL transforms data on a separate processing server, therefore raw data is never
    transferred into the data warehouse. The process of transforming data into a separate
    processing server makes it slower to ingest data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, ELT transfers raw data to the data warehouse and the data is transformed
    there. Due to ELT not using a separate processing server, the delivery of data
    ingestion is faster.
