  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re learning data engineering, Docker is one of the first tools you
    can add to your toolbox. Docker is a popular containerization tool that lets you
    package applications—with dependencies and config—in a single artifact called
    the image. This way Docker lets you create a consistent and reproducible environment
    to run all of your applications within a container.

    from scratch. You’ll start by building a simple ELT pipeline that you’ll get to
    improve throughout the rest of the course.
  prefs: []

    that you have learned thus far come together in building this pipeline that runs
    Postgres in Docker for both the source and destination.

- en: So far, you’ve built an ELT pipeline that runs upon manual triggering. But you
    certainly need some automation, and the simplest way to do this is to define a
    cron job that automatically runs at a specific time of the day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Airflow (which you’ll learn in the next module) give you more granularity over
    the pipeline.

    orchestration tool Airflow.

    enjoyed the course—especially the hands-on approach to building and incrementally
    improving a data pipeline—instead of focusing on only theory. The code is also
    available for you to follow along. So, happy data engineering!
