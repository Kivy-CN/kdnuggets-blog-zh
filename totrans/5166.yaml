- en: SQL (Structured Query Language) is the programming language for managing data
    in a relational database. Most data scientists will use relational data and there
    is a somewhat small misconception that the job of database manipulation falls
    on the hands of the great and all powerful “DATA ENGINEER”. Practically speaking,
    as a data scientist, do you want to go to someone else every time you need to
    extract a piece of data?

- en: In reality there are so many jobs for data scientists asking for SQL experience/skills
    but either we do not learn it in our academics or don’t bother with it to learn
    ourselves so we have more time for R and Python learning. Yes, it's true there's
    a finite amount of time in a day, week, month etc. but databases are the houses
    of our data and data scientists HAVE TO HAVE A KEY!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, to give a quick summary of why you want this technique, Views will reduce
    your need to run the same script over-and-over again to access the same data.
    We are guilty of creating an SQL script and once we get it right, we just save
    it in a folder and then run it again. Why do this when we can just save it as
    a View and just use it as you would a SQL table.
  id: totrans-14

    new SQL user or beginner SQL academic class would use.

- en: Now, let's say you need to reference this table multiple times for your work
    and every time you find yourself rerunning the script. If this is a large table,
    you know it is more than likely that it will take a very long time. A View will
    save you time and let you reference this anytime you want and manipulate it almost
    like a normal table.

- en: It is as simple as that to create a view. This is not storing or creating a
    new table exactly but it is enabling the user to create the previous table with
    a simple command as ‘*SELECT * FROM customers.orders’.* That’s all you have to
    do instead of having to save a file and rerun the script. Just open your SQL application
    and just run the relevant select statement.

    you want. It is another method of creating efficiencies in your SQL data manipulation
    workflow.

- en: Again such a simple method to create a little efficiency. This does look similar
    to a view but a different execution method. Which in essence is true to an extent,
    but the difference comes when you can specify **parameters** to your stored procedure.
    This works like a function or filter in SQL. I would say this is mostly used as
    a quick filter method than anything else. Of course there are many other possibilities
    now that you can add parameters.

    procedure. It always starts with ‘@’ in SQL Server and the *‘AS int’* is to specify
    the data type expected. In this circumstance, we use it in the WHERE clause to
    filter the customer and order details by the number of purchases.

  id: totrans-31
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a statistician, I think there are a lot of people that can piece together
    the definition of a scalar function. But let me give you a definition anyway.
    In terms of SQL, a scalar function is a piece of code that takes one or more parameters
    to calculate and return a single value. We regularly use SQL to create data aggregations.
  id: totrans-32
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my personal opinion, think of this as GROUP BY 2.0\. Might be a bit of stretch
    to say that but essentially allows you to do some more complex calculations on
    data that may not be directly available to you by default on SQL.

    novice data scientists. Databases are now moving to the cloud and the data generated
    around the world is getting bigger and bigger.

- en: Database technology needs to keep up with the data to be as useful as possible
    and the data scientists of today and tomorrow need to be able to manipulate a
    database at a higher level than just having the most complicated piece of code
    as a mere GROUP BY. We need to improve processes, be faster and more agile.
