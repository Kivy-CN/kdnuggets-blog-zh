- en: Sometimes, when we are too focused on learning about the technical implementations
    of Machine Learning we tend to ignore important issues of this technology like
    its future applications and political consequences. In this post, instead of discussing
    what language to use or what algorithm works best for a problem, we have gathered
    a set of videos from the highly popular nonprofit organization, TED.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this series of videos, you will find interesting discussions and conferences
    about AI and Machine Learning from a "big picture" perspective. You will hear
    about the different positions regarding the upcoming developments in the field,
    its implications, advantages, and consequences on a world-wide scale. Topics range
    from the politics and technological responsibilities of AI; its impact on the
    future job market, and even about the its role in art.

- en: Artificial intelligence is getting smarter by leaps and bounds -- within this
    century, research suggests, a computer AI could be as "smart" as a human being.
    A philosopher and technologist, Bostrom asks us to think hard about the world
    we're building right now, driven by thinking machines. Will our smart machines
    help to preserve humanity and our values -- or will they have values of their
    own?

    Sam Harris -- and not just in some theoretical way. We're going to build superhuman
    machines, says Harris, but we haven't yet grappled with the problems associated
    with creating something that may treat us the way we treat ants.

    sorting mail anymore -- today, it''s capable of far more complex applications,
    like grading essays and diagnosing diseases. With these advances comes an uneasy
    question: Will a robot do your job in the future.'

- en: In an eye-opening talk, she details how the same algorithms companies like Facebook,
    Google and Amazon use to get you to click on ads are also used to organize your
    access to political and social information. And the machines aren't even the real
    threat. What we need to understand is how the powerful might use AI to control
    us -- and what we can do in response.

    we humans will end up with significant unemployment. What should we do about it?
    In a straightforward talk about a controversial idea, futurist Martin Ford makes
    the case for separating income from traditional work and instituting a universal
    basic income.

    machine perception and distributed learning. In this captivating demo, he shows
    how neural nets trained to recognize images can be run in reverse, to generate
    them. The results: spectacular, hallucinatory collages (and poems!) that defy
    categorization.'

    superhuman performance in perception, creativity and cognitive function -- from
    turbocharging our design skills to helping us remember everything we''ve ever

    smarter will have a profound impact on nearly everything we do. Kelly explores
    three trends in AI we need to understand in order to embrace it and steer its
    development.

- en: New tech spawns new anxieties, says scientist and philosopher Grady Booch, but
    we don't need to be afraid an all-powerful, unfeeling AI. Booch allays our worst
    (sci-fi induced) fears about super intelligent computers by explaining how we'll
    teach, not program, them to share our human values. Rather than worry about an
    unlikely existential threat, he urges us to consider how artificial intelligence
    will enhance human life.

    also preventing the catastrophe of robotic takeover? As we move closer toward
    creating all-knowing machines, AI pioneer Stuart Russell is working on something
    a bit different: robots with uncertainty. Hear his vision for human-compatible
    AI that can solve problems using common sense, altruism and other human values.'
