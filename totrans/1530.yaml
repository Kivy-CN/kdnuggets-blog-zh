- en: A data science portfolio should consist of 3-5 projects that showcase your job-relevant
    skills. Again, the goal here is to prove you can do the work, so the more your
    portfolio looks like the day-to-day work of the jobs you’re applying for, the
    more convincing it’s going to be.

    says [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) CEO and co-founder Refael “Rafi” Zikavashvili.
    “Solve a problem that relates to the companies that you’re interested in.”

    also the *subject areas* your projects examine, and the *types of data sets* you’re
    working with. Let’s take a closer look at each of these three factors:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Kinds of tasks**: What sorts of things will you need to do in the job you’re
    applying to? Will you be doing a lot of data cleaning? Machine learning? Data
    visualization? Natural language processing? Will you be strictly doing analysis,
    or will you be building dashboards and other analytics tools for others? Whatever
    the answers to these questions, they should be integrated into your portfolio.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Subject areas**: Are you looking at positions in marketing? You’ll probably
    want to highlight projects aimed at answering marketing-related questions. If
    you’re looking for a data job in mobile app development, you’ll want to show off
    projects that demonstrate you can pull useful product insights from app data.
    Using your projects to show that you have some knowledge of, or at least interest
    in, subjects and business problems relevant to the jobs you’ve applied to can
    help your application stand out.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Types of data sets**: Different types of data may be common in different
    industries, so showing that you have some experience working with data sets similar
    to the ones you’d see on the job helps prove you’ve got what it takes to do the
    work. If you’re likely to be looking at a lot of time series data in the target
    job, for example, it would be helpful to showcase some time series analysis skills
    in your portfolio.'

    for, the better the results you’re likely to get. But if you’re applying for entry-level
    positions, you’re probably casting a wide net, and you’re also likely to be looking
    at positions that require a lot of the same skills regardless of industry. If
    you put together a portfolio with at least one project in each of these categories,
    you’ll be off to an excellent start.

- en: '**Data Cleaning Project**: Data preparation, data, munging, data cleaning –
    whatever you want to call it, it accounts for 60-80% of most data science jobs,
    so you *definitely* need a project that demonstrates your data scrubbing skills.
    At a bare minimum, you’ll want to find a messy data set (*don’t* pick anything
    that’s already been cleaned), come up with some interesting analytical questions
    to examine, and then clean the data and perform some basic analysis to answer
    those questions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to step the difficulty up here, collecting your own data (via APIs,
    web scraping, or some other method) demonstrates some additional skill. Working
    with [unstructured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data)of some
    sort (as opposed to a messy-but-still-structured data set) also looks good.

- en: '**Data Storytelling and Visualization Project**: Telling stories, offering
    real insight, and convincing others with data are key parts of any data science
    job. The best analysis in the world is useless if you can’t get your CEO to understand
    or take action based on it. This project should take readers on an analytical
    journey and bring them to a conclusion that’s understandable even to a layperson
    with little coding or statistical background.'

- en: Data visualization and communication skills will be important here to show and
    explain what your code is doing. It would be fine to present this in the form
    of a Jupyter Notebook or in R Markdown, but you could add some extra difficulty
    with additional polish, like customizing your chart designs or including some
    interactive elements.
  prefs: []

- en: '**A Group Project**: Working together in a group demonstrates you’ve got communication
    and collaboration skills, both of which are important for data science jobs. Any
    type of project could be a group project; what’s important here is to demonstrate
    that you can function in a team setting both in interpersonal terms (clear communication,
    fair division of labor, genuine collaboration) and in technical terms (managing
    projects with Git and GitHub).'

- en: If you want to up the difficulty here, try to get involved with a popular open
    source project, like contributing to a data-science-related open-source library
    in a language of your choice. This can be quite difficult, but if you do manage
    to make a contribution to a popular library or package, this can really make your
    application stand out to employers.

    says that “successful commits to well-known open-source projects” are one of the
    things that makes a data science portfolio stand out to her. [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/) HR
    Director Jeff Hall said that “What really puts a plus in the column of candidates
    that apply here is having contributed to our specific open-source projects.”

- en: '**End-to-End System Building Project**: A lot of data science jobs can include
    building systems that can efficiently analyze regular data sets as they come in,
    rather than analyzing a single specific data set. For example, you might be tasked
    with building a dashboard for the sales team that visualizes the company’s sales
    data and updates regularly as new data comes in.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This project should show that you’re capable of building a system that can perform
    the same analysis on new data sets as they’re input, as well as capable of building
    a system that can be understood and run with relative ease by others. The simplest
    version of this would be well-commented code that can take data from a public,
    regularly-updated data set, and perform some analysis. Its `README` file should
    explain *how* it can be used by others, and the project should be relatively easy
    for other coders to run via the command line.

    build full-fledged interactive web dashboards, or build a system that handles
    real-time/streaming data. The key here is just to show that you can build an analytical
    system that’s reusable and that other people, or at the very least other programmers,
    can understand.'

- en: '**Explanatory Blog Post, Article, or Talk**: Being able to explain complex
    technical concepts in simple, understandable terms is a valuable skill for any
    data scientist, so explaining some technical concept in a blog post, article,
    or conference talk can be a great addition to your portfolio if it’s done well.
    Just be sure to pick a topic that’s suitably complex, and one that you understand
    and can explain. A blog post explaining what’s happening under the hood in a machine
    learning algorithm that’s frequently used in your target industry, for example,
    could be a great inclusion to a portfolio.'
