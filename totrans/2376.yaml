    take the best action and organize data to form the most relevant and compatible
    decisions. Pictorially, a decision tree is a tree-like framework with nodes containing
    information.

    of a decision tree. It then further divides into branches and internal nodes.
    Internal nodes are the subsequent information pieces that a viewer analyses before
    concluding.

    points and signify the end of information while following a particular path in
    a decision tree.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Internal nodes depict the conditions, and the leaf node represents the final
    decision based on selected needs. Starting from the root node, a user or an ML/AI
    pattern establishes the desired conditions and finally arrives at the leaf node
    that provides the final decision.

    As discussed decision tree is a tree-like framework with sequential information
    flow. Here, the user or the ML/AI patterns follow the relevancy of conditions
    encapsulated in the nodes. On the flip side, a random forest combines uncorrelated
    decision trees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Random forest is preferred in areas where data scientists need to derive results
    from humongous and disorderly data. Since decision trees follow a similar thought
    process, the final prediction given by a singular tree can be susceptible to bias.
    A random forest eliminates this from happening.
