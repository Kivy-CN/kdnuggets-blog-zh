    We do not bother about how much time it takes to execute or whether it can handle
    millions of records. But at the intermediate level, people expect your query to
    be optimized and take minimum time to execute.

- en: Writing an optimized query in large applications with millions of records, like
    e-commerce platforms or banking systems, is imperative. Suppose you own an e-commerce
    company with more than a million products, and a customer wants to search for
    a product. What if the query you wrote in the backend takes more than a minute
    to fetch that product from the database? Will you think the customers buy products
    from your website?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to understand the importance of SQL query optimization. In this tutorial,
    I will show you some tips and tricks to optimize your SQL queries and make them
    to execute faster. The primary pre-requisite is that you must have a basic knowledge
    of SQL.

- en: 1\. Use EXIST() instead of COUNT() to find a Specific Element in the Table
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To check whether a specific element is present in the table, use the `EXIST()`
    keyword instead of the `COUNT()` will run the query in a more optimized way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using `COUNT()`, the query needs to count all the occurrences of that particular
    element which may be inefficient when the database is extensive. On the other
    hand, `EXIST()` will check only the first occurrence of that element and then
    stop when it finds the first occurrence. This saves a lot of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, you are only interested in finding whether a particular element is present
    or not. You are not interested in finding the number of occurrences. That’s why
    also `EXIST()` is better.

- en: The above query will return **1** if at least one table row contains an entry
    where a column named `myColumn` has a value equal to **val**. Otherwise, it will
    return **0**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Use of Varchar instead of Char
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both `char` and `varchar` data types are used to store character strings in
    the table. But `varchar` is much more memory efficient than `char`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The char datatype can only store the character string of fixed length defined.
    If the length of the string is less than the fixed length, then it will pad the
    blank spaces to make its length equal to the set length. This will unnecessarily
    waste memory in padding. For example,`CHAR(100)` will take 100 bytes of memory
    even if a single character is stored.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, varchar datatype stores the character string of variable
    length having a length less than the maximum length specified. It does not pad
    the blank spaces and only takes the memory equal to the string's actual length.
    For example, `VARCHAR(100)` takes only 1 byte of memory when storing a single
    character.

- en: In the above example, a table `myTable` is created having two columns, `charCol`
    and `varcharCol` having char and varchar datatypes respectively. `charCol` will
    always take 10 bytes of memory. In contrast, `varcharCol` takes memory equal to
    the actual size of the character string stored in it.

- en: 3\. Avoid Subqueries in WHERE Clause
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We must avoid using subqueries inside the WHERE clause to optimize an SQL query.
    As the subqueries can be expensive and difficult to execute when they return a
    large number of rows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of using the subquery, you can get the same result by using a join operation
    or writing a correlated subquery. A correlated subquery is a subquery in which
    the inner query depends on the outer query. And they are very efficient as compared
    to non-correlated subquery.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Below is an example to understand the difference between the two.

- en: '[PRE2]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the 1st example, the subquery first collects all the customer ids that belong
    to INDIA, and then the outer query will get all the orders of the selected customer
    ids. And in the 2nd example, we have achieved the same result by joining the `customers`
    and `orders` tables and then selecting only orders where the customers belong
    from INDIA.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this way, we can optimize the query by avoiding the use of subqueries inside
    the WHERE clause and making them easier to read and understand.

- en: 4\. Ordering JOINs from a Larger Table to a Smaller Table
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Applying the `JOIN` operation from a larger table to a smaller table is a common
    SQL optimization technique. Because joining from a larger table to a smaller table
    will make your query to execute faster. If we apply a `JOIN` operation from a
    smaller table to a larger table, our SQL engine has to search in a larger table
    for matching rows. This is more resource-intensive and time-consuming. But on
    the other hand, if the `JOIN` is applied from a larger table to a smaller table,
    then the SQL engine has to search in a smaller table for matching rows.

- en: 5\. Use `regexp_like` instead of `LIKE` Clause
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the `LIKE` clause, `regexp_like` is also used for pattern searching.
    The `LIKE` clause is a basic pattern-matching operator that can perform only basic
    operations like **_** or **%**, which are used to match a single character or
    any number of characters respectively. The `LIKE` clause must scan the complete
    database to find the particular pattern, which is slow for large tables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, `regexp_like` is a more efficient, optimized, and powerful
    pattern-searching technique. It uses more complex regular expressions to find
    specific patterns in a character string. These regular expressions are more specific
    than simple wildcard matching because they allow you to search for the exact pattern
    that we are finding. Due to this, the amount of data that needs to be searched
    is reduced, and the query executes faster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Please note that `regexp_like` may not be present in all database management
    systems. Its syntax and functionality may vary in other systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The above queries are used to find the elements that name starts with A or B.
    In the first example, `LIKE` is used to search all the names that start with A
    or B. `A%` means that the first character is A; after that, any number of characters
    can be present. In the second example, `regexp_like` is used. Inside `^[AB]`,
    `^` represents that the symbol will match at the beginning of the string, `[AB]`
    represents that the beginning character can be A or B, and `.*` represents all
    the characters after that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using `regexp_like`, the database can quickly filter out the rows that don’t
    match the pattern, improving performance and reducing resource usage.

    SQL query. This article gives you a clear understanding of how to write efficient
    SQL queries and the importance of optimizing them. There are many more ways of
    optimizing the queries, like preferring the use of integer values rather than
    characters or using Union All instead of Union when your table doesn’t contain
    duplicates, etc.
