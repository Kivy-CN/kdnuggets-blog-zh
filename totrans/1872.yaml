- en: An algorithm is a series of steps with rules that help us solve problems and
    accomplish goals. And when we structure these steps and rules the right way we
    can automate the algorithm to establish Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). And it
    is this A.I. that helps us do our analytical heavy lifting so we can focus our
    time on doing the things that we’re good at… the things we were hired to do.

    helps us discover and focus on the key subject matter expertise that makes our
    human capital good, really good at what they do. But using A.I. in the work place
    does get complicated. It gets complicated because there are different levels of
    algorithms used to implement A.I., each varying in their use and impact. To better
    balance our human capital with our A.I. capital, here are the top 10 algorithm
    categories used to implement A.I., Big Data, and Data Science.

    rules to number crunch a complex problem. We give these algorithms the data, and
    they come back with an answer. If we don’t like the answer we give the algorithms
    more data to fine-tune their answer. Crunchers are good at classifying customers,
    estimating project durations, and analyzing survey data to understand our business
    culture.'

- en: '**Guides.** These algorithms guide us on how to best navigate a policy, process,
    or workflow based on historic actions that were successful. Guides are good at
    coordinating a lot of moving parts needed to understand and execute things like
    risk management, strategic change, and complex project management.'

    with predictions, rankings, and likelihood-of-success based on historic patterns.
    Advisors are good at advising us on decision-making, planning, and risk mitigation.'

- en: '**Predictors.** These algorithms predict future human behaviors and events
    by using small repeatable decisions and judgments that interpret historic behaviors
    and events. Predictors are good at business planning, market forecasting, brand
    management, health diagnosis, and predicting consumer behaviors, brand attractiveness,
    fraud, marketing opportunities, weather events, and disease outbreaks.'

    and react accordingly. They do this by applying a combination of short-term tactical
    rules along with information they learned about the people involved. Tacticians
    are good at balancing supply chains, systems performance, human capital workloads,
    and assembly lines.'

    accordingly. Strategists look past the data uncovering insights and innovative
    opportunities. They do this by applying a combination of short-term and long-term
    strategic rules along with information they learned about the people involved
    and how these people react in various environments. Strategists are good at forecasting
    market demand, customer attrition, human productivity, and employee attrition.'

    work freeing us to do what we’ve been hired to do. These algorithms have some
    subject matter expertise allowing them to do our analytical heavy lifting. Lifters
    are good at analyzing and recognizing repeatable patterns and gaps in regulations,
    fraud, risks, improvements, transformations, opportunities, and innovations.'

    amount of subject matter expertise in our area allowing us to be more productive
    and more focused. Partners are good at advising us, training us, keeping us up
    to date with market changes, and coordinating us and our efforts daily, quarterly
    and annually. Partners understand how we tick from our behaviors to when we should
    eat lunch to what temperature we need the air conditioning at.'

    allowing groups of us to do all our foundational analytical work. Once the algorithms
    complete their analyses we each review the work based on our own expertise and
    then okay the work. Okays are good at building the big picture through deep analysis
    and looking at things from all angles. They are useful for business planning,
    strategic change, and culture change.'
