    Now, the field of big data and analytics is driving the bulk of business operations,
    marketing strategies, logistical decisions, and, of course, the burgeoning field
    of AI.

    commonplace that any organization worth their salt, no matter the size, should
    be leveraging insight from big data analytics and technology — and industry reports
    show that they are beginning to. According to the Dresner Advisory Services’ [Big
    Data Analytics Market Study 2017](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/20/1267022/0/en/Dresner-Advisory-Services-Publishes-2017-Big-Data-Analytics-Market-Study.html),
    big data adoption was up 53 percent in 2017 across all companies surveyed, a marked
    uptick from the 17 percent reported in 2015.

    have been and still are proliferating around the globe. By 2020, there will be
    an estimated [6.1 billion smartphone users](https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/6-1b-smartphone-users-globally-by-2020-overtaking-basic-fixed-phone-subscriptions/#.brp6v1:RPIH)
    worldwide, creating exorbitant amounts of data every second. In fact, the amount
    of data in our digital universe doubles about every two years, and is predicted
    to reach a size of [40,000 exabytes (or 40 trillion gigabytes)](http://www.baselinemag.com/analytics-big-data/slideshows/surprising-statistics-about-big-data.html)
    by 2020 as well, according to Baseline Magazine.

    and analytics, with graduates, job seekers, and those seeking career changes alike
    all vying for an opportunity to execute them. Because big data touches almost
    every industry across the board, those who aren’t already working in data and
    analytics will soon be utilizing the technology for its undeniable business benefits.
    Whichever way you slice it, the future of work is through data.

    of all the data generated by these technologies and connected devices, more people
    are needed than ever to work in the information technology sector. In fact, [according
    to statistics established in the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2016-2017 Occupational
    Outlook Handbook (OOH)](https://www2.staffingindustry.com/Editorial/IT-Staffing-Report/Archive-IT-Staffing-Report/2016/Jan.-7-2016/US-Bureau-of-Labor-Statistics-projects-12.5-growth-in-IT-employment-through-2024),
    employment in the *Computer and Information Technology* occupation group is projected
    to increase 12.5 percent in the 10-year period between 2014 and 2024\. This is
    well ahead of the 6.5 percent growth projected for the rest of the job market,

    data, rather than the analysis of it. Ashley Stein, [writing for the Record Nations
    blog](https://www.recordnations.com/2016/09/data-breach-recovery-plan/), notes
    that an essential part of any organization’s data breach recovery plan should
    include hiring an outside expert to investigate the issue.

    for in potential big data hires is the ability to demonstrate “flexibility” or
    “adaptability.” This is because big data and analytics has been such a disruptive
    field itself, in relation to the rest of the workforce — assuming any type of
    immunity to similar disruptive forces would be severely asinine. In fact, disruptive
    technological changes might already on the horizon for big data, as researchers
