- en: A Data Science team, carefully constructed with the right set of dedicated professionals,
    can prove to be an asset to any organization. It's a fact that success of any
    project is dictated by the expertise of its resources and data science is no exception
    to this golden rule of thumb. Professionals with diversified skill-sets are required
    to successfully negotiate the challenges of a complex big data project.

- en: For your data science project to be on the right track, you need to ensure that
    the team has skilled professionals capable of playing three essential roles - **data
    engineer, machine learning expert** and **business analyst**. The presence of
    these three groups, working together for a common goal, would result in proper
    analysis of relevant information for predicting the behavior of consumers, in
    line with the business objective.

    We will also shed some light on the profile of the desired candidates who can
    be trusted to do justice to these three roles.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The role of a data engineer is at the base of the pyramid. Data engineers constitute
    the foundation of a data science project and they are trusted with the responsibility
    of capturing, storing and processing the relevant data. Data Collection, Data
    Warehousing, Data Transformation and Data Analysis - these are typically handled
    by a team of data engineers.

- en: They are the professionals who play with the tools and frameworks, like Hadoop
    or HBase, in a distributed environment to ensure that all the raw data points
    are captured and processed correctly. The processed data is then handed over to
    the next group of people, the machine learning experts, for taking it further.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data engineer is predominantly a technical role. The ideal candidate does not
    need to be very academic but must possess technical competency on the back-end
    frameworks and tools used for capturing the data points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are pro with Hadoop, MapReduce or HBase, then the role of a data engineer
    would perfectly match your profile. Besides technical acumen, analytical skills
    are also required to become a successful data engineer. A data engineer should
    be flexible to learn new tools according to the changing business needs and always
    be willing to upgrade to specialized techniques related to data analysis.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning experts play the role of a link between the data engineers
    and the business analysts. They are primarily responsible for building data models
    and developing algorithms to draw conclusive information. Their job is to ensure
    that the derived information is well researched, accurate, easy to understand
    and unbiased.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Candidates with statistical background, having a deep interest in quantitative
    topics, are usually preferred for the role of machine learning experts. The ideal
    professional must have a solid understanding of data algorithms and data structures
    in specific, and software engineering concepts in general. Capability of handling
    computational complexity can be considered as an added bonus.

- en: Data exploration and data visualization are the two most important responsibilities
    associated with the role of a business analyst. Business analysts work with front-end
    tools related to the core business and interact with the higher management of
    an organization. They further analyze business-level data provided by the machine
    learning experts to find out insights related to the organization's core business
    interests.![data-480](../Images/5a0dbca3e436e0953c88455a4676e264.png)

- en: Another important responsibility of a business analyst is to coordinate with
    the data engineers and machine learning experts to make them understand the business
    objectives and identify possible focus areas. The ultimate responsibility of a
    business analyst is to produce actionable insights based on the processed data
    and help the company leadership in their decision making process.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Business analysts should have expert level knowledge on the underlying business
    data and source systems. The ideal candidate should have an eye for details and
    must possess exceptional analytical skills. Moreover, solid understanding of the
    organization's business model and the ability to think out of the box are two
    important qualities that all business analysts should definitely have. It is also
    important to have sufficient technical skills to come up with precise dashboards
    for representing business data in a structured manner.

    alone may not be sufficient for attaining success. It holds true for almost any
    project that relies on a team. Whether you want to [start a blog](http://wisestartupblog.com/)with
    multiple authors or wish to build an online business with a team of partners,
    it is important for all the involved parties to think beyond the individual scope
    and work as one single coherent unit. When that happens, rest assured, success
    will automatically follow suit.**'
