    into various GPU and CPU cores. TensorFlow can be used with various programming
    languages like C++, Python, and Java. It uses tensors which are storages that
    contain n-dimensional data with their liner operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TensorFlow handles deep and neural networks, text, speech, and image recognition,
    which are the principal focus of all businesses. It can handle partial differential
    equations easily. You get new updates every two to three months, which can be
    annoying for the user to download and bind with the current system.

    work with different programming languages and as a [valuable tool for ML](/2020/09/most-complete-guide-pytorch-data-scientists.html)
    and DL learning. It is open-source like many ML libraries; like TensorFlow, PyTorch
    also uses Tensors. Moreover, it can support Python and C++ programming languages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, since PyTorch is relatively new, there is plenty of room for improvement.
    The good news is that it has a strong support community. It is more Python-friendly
    and supports both GPU and CPU. PyTorch is an easy debugging tool that has simple
    code, robust APIs, better optimization, and the benefit of computational graph
    support.
