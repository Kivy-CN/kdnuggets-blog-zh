  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    how good a data scientist you are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or subject area. This knowledge includes intricacies, challenges, terminologies,
    processes, and nuances of that particular domain.

    for a particular company within a particular industry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you practice coding, it would be ideal if you did that on actual questions
    by the company you’re interviewing for. I mentioned [StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+ds+job+interview+tips)
    and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) in the first article.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, you can practice on challenges not coming from the interviews directly.
    But when you choose them, try to find [data science interview questions](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/40-data-science-interview-questions-from-top-companies/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+ds+job+interview+tips)
    and datasets from the relevant industry. Say you’re interviewing for Meta (tech
    industry) and Pfizer (pharmaceutical industry). These companies work with completely
    different data, which behaves differently. Naturally, the questions will then
    be different, too. So, for Meta, use tech/social media data, and for Pfizer, pharmaceutical
    data.

    You’ll possibly run into specific data you’re unfamiliar with, so you’ll have
    to learn about it and its importance within the industry.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data storytelling means you can communicate the insights from your data projects
    clearly and understandably. Think about why you started a certain project and
    what you achieved; there’s always a story in there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By creating a story from your project, you’ll make data more accessible for
    non-technical people. In return, you’ll have more influence on the decision-making.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here are some tips for showcasing this skill.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Create a Narrative:** Any good story has an arc: exposition, a problem, rising
    action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Include this in telling your story
    using data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You could start with the business context, e.g., “The company launched five
    new products in the last three years.” Then, the problem. You noticed that sales
    are increasing, but customer retention is not. You’ll now act by going deeper
    into the data and trying to find the reasons for the retention issue. Here, your
    story should dig deep into the technical aspects of the project: *what* you did
    and *why*. The climax is when you find one product with high sales but also high
    return rates. The falling action is when you discuss potential reasons for high
    returns. In the resolution, you make a recommendation for product improvements.
    In the resolution, directly relate to what your project did, and quantify its
    achievements. Don’t let your story finish with you giving product improvement
    recommendations, but tell about the sales increase of that product, how much money
    it brought to the company, etc.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Use Clear Visualizations:** Use visualizations that support your story.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In your project on sales trends over the past years, don’t just show a table
    with monthly sales figures. Instead, use a line graph to visually represent the
    ups and downs in sales. This way, the audience will grasp the trend. For significant
    spikes in sales, use a bar chart to break down the sales by product or product
    categories, highlighting which products drove the spike.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Avoid Jargon And Simplify Complex Concepts:** Use technical terminology only
    when necessary. The point is to ‘sell’ (sometimes even literally) your idea and
    project to business people, so simplify complex concepts for them. Don’t say,
    “The heteroscedasticity in the residuals indicated that our linear regression
    model might not be the best fit.” Instead, say, “The patterns in our data suggested
    that our initial model might not be capturing all the information effectively."
    Much better!'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We all make mistakes. They are necessary in the learning process. Interviewers
    don’t seek a perfect candidate; they’re looking for someone who wants and can
    learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let the interviewer get to know that side of you. If you honestly share your
    failures and what you learned from them, it will build trust and demonstrate your
    setbacks resilience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here are some tips on how to talk about this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Avoid the Blame Game:** Avoid blaming everyone and everything for your mistakes.
    Of course, give the context of circumstances out of your control, but don’t play
    a victim. Take responsibility for your part, show what you learned from these
    circumstances, and talk about what you should’ve done differently.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Emphasize the Learning, Not the Failure Part:** Talking about the failures
    should only serve to present how and what you learned from them, so focus on that.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Talk From Experience:** Find a real example from your previous job. Even
    if it’s not in data science, it may be applicable if it shows your focus on learning
    and self-awareness. If you don’t have working experience, talk about mistakes
    you made in your data projects and what you learned.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Talk About the Steps You Took:** This relates to what you did to correct
    your mistake or minimize its impact, e.g., changing the data, tweaking the algorithm,
    or altogether ditching the project and starting a new.'

    for a project aimed at predicting customer churn. I chose the k-nearest neighbor
    algorithm based on my initial understanding and ran with it. However, the results

    so my EDA wasn’t very thorough. Despite that, I realize now that I should''ve
    done a more detailed EDA. After I found out about the inconsistencies, I collaborated
    with the data quality team to understand them better. I also explored other algorithms
    and evaluated them. Finally, I switched to the XGBoost algorithm, which improved
    the model’s prediction accuracy significantly. I learned not to underestimate
    the importance of EDA. I’m also glad that I wasn’t afraid to admit mistakes and
    start from scratch having in mind that we would have no use for a model we couldn’t
    trust.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science is more than brainless data handling and code writing. This involves
    being able to translate your work into mere mortals’ language via data storytelling
    and visualizations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will showcase this by talking about it in the interview. You need to make
    sure you can talk the talk but also prove that you can walk the walk. The best
    way to do this is by having a solid data project portfolio, where your coding,
    storytelling, and visualization skills will be apparent.

    them openly and seek feedback from your interviewer.
