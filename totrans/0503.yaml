- en: Analytics Engineer is a new position [coined](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) (and
    made possible) by dbt. If a Data Engineer (DE) marries a Data Analyst (DA) and
    they have a baby girl, that baby girl will be an Analytics Engineer (AE). Well,
    it does not work that way, but you get the point.

    wants to do more because that DE guy works like a snail. She knows her data well
    because she spent hours per day navigating it using her mad SQL skills. She also
    knows the business inside out, having to interact with them on a daily basis.
    But she is faced with enormous challenges wanting to take on the work of the DE
    guy. Here are some of them:'

    create an entirely new position in the field, you ask? Let’s see.
