    design, forecasting, modelling, statistical inference, or other things typically
    taught in statistics departments. Generally speaking though, the work product
    of a data scientist is not "p-values and confidence intervals" as academic statistics
    sometimes seems to suggest (and as it sometimes is for traditional statisticians
    working in the pharmaceutical industry, for example). At Google, Type A Data Scientists
    are known variously as Statistician, Quantitative Analyst, Decision Support Engineering
    Analyst, or Data Scientist, and probably a few more.

    Data Science. But building itself is not enough. When you start with limited resources
    and try to build a serious app for Data Science, you find quite quickly that the
    biggest limitation is the lack of serious data. So, like everyone else you also
    end up building your app against the [UCI datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)
    (or similar). Hence, you need to think of wider strategies in addition to building.
    Here are some of the strategies we follow in our teaching:'

    imagine you have spent the better part of your career with Oracle and you want
    to be a Data Scientist. Why not start with Oracle?  There is a whole suite of
    [Oracle BI tools](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/business_intelligence) . These
    cover the whole range from visualization to advanced analytics. They use Pl/SQL
    or R. That helps to get you started a lot faster instead of learning something
    entirely new. I would also use the same strategy for Microsoft ([Azure and Power
    BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-azure-and-power-bi/))
    and [Amazon (AWS IoT)](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/how-it-works/) – both these
    platforms are advanced'

    and application of algorithms) with Big Data (Hadoop based distributed infrastructure).
    To master the former – you must have some background with Statistics and understand
    the maths behind the predictions. I do not think you can really master both especially
    in the early stages. But people still try! And they do not get far in either.
    So, my advice in my teaching is to focus on the use of Statistics(algorithms)
    to solve problems. It is also worth reading this insightful post - [Why Big Data
    is in trouble? Because they forgot about applied statistics](/2016/07/big-data-trouble-forgot-applied-statistics.html).
    Also remember that some of the best known Data Scientists today like [Gregory
    Piatetsky-Shapiro](/gps.html) and [Kirk D Borne](http://www.boozallen.com/careers/meet-our-people/kirk-borne)
    come from a strong maths/stats background.'

    the same as Big Data(because it may not be distributed data processing) – but
    focusing on very large datasets gives you a richer experience. This is valid even
    if that dataset is not directly related to the application you may be working
    with in future. In other words, the experience of handling large datasets in itself
    is valuable. That explains why many Data Scientists like [Kirk D Borne](http://www.boozallen.com/careers/meet-our-people/kirk-borne)
    have a background with NASA (or Space research) – because of the abundance of
    Data. Also, many good data scientists come from a background of weather prediction(for
    the same reason). In our business (Data Science for IoT), the data volumes matter.
    You can either do IoT analytics using a simple Raspberry Pi/Arduino or you can
    analyse data for an entire Airliner or an Oil Rig. The two are entirely different.
    One of the best books I like on Data Science is [Statistics, Data Mining, and
    Machine Learning in Astronomy: A Practical Python Guide for the Analysis of Survey
    Data Željko Ivezić, Andrew J. Connolly, Jacob T. VanderPlas & Alexander Gray](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10159.html).
    Even at 550 odd pages it is very readable. But more importantly, it works with
    [very high volumes of Datasets](http://www.astroml.org/user_guide/datasets.html)'
