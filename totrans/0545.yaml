    journey at this company as a Machine Learning Engineer, but rather transitioned
    to it as I was growing within the company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My formal education is Computer Science/Software Engineering, and in fact I
    have been working as a software developer for about 8 years. All these years as
    a software engineer have given me some skills that have made my path towards ML
    Engineering rather particular. I want to share with you what I wished I had focused
    on more when preparing for the role, and also how I think my background helped
    me on this transition.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First off - why? Was I not happy with my job as a Software Engineer? Do I think
    being an ML Engineer is somehow better than being a Software Engineer? **By no
    means!** It is just a matter of what I like to spend my time with, and that is *data*.
    I have been coding since I was 15, and I have always loved it. But what I love
    the most is using my work to understand the world. As lots of people, I have a
    lot of “pet project” *ideas* that never come alive, but nonetheless when I read
    this list of ideas, I find things like: *Build tool to use twitter data for natural
    disaster detection, analyse data from my social media accounts to understand my
    own behaviour, detect moods in friends’ chats, etc.* Do you see the pattern? All
    of those project ideas seek understanding of some situation, and all are centred
    around data. I have then always had a great interest in data, and about two years
    ago I made the decision that I wanted that to be my main job. I want to think
    that Machine Learning was my personal choice, but in the spirit of being data-driven,
    I can map my decision to the tip of the hype in the Machine Learning field in
    recent years, when every tech article you read was about some ML innovation, so
    I guess I will never know.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyway, I took that decision, and fortunately for me, iZettle was running a
    Machine Learning mentoring program in which I happily enrolled.

    Machine Learning](https://www.packtpub.com/product/python-machine-learning-third-edition/9781789955750).
    Every week, we would discuss a chapter and code some exercises to experiment with
    the concepts learned. I found it very much exciting and it really settled my base
    understanding on how Machine Learning works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides that, I used my free time to take some online courses, like a [Deep
    Learning specialisation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) in
    Udacity, participating in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions (with
    not much success, I have to admit), and trying to implement some of those projects
    I mentioned before.

    it was from that first project that I started noticing how different it is to
    study machine learning from actually *doing* machine learning. This first project
    was about trying to predict bankruptcy for our merchants, so that we could reach
    out and help them in their business.

    of that project is already done for you. That is: *What is it exactly you are
    trying to do?* In a course, you are given a dataset, a target metric, and all
    you have to do is “massage” your data and train models to get good performance
    on your target metric.

    from a Machine Learning point of view? For the bankruptcy problem, I was shocked
    about how many questions suddenly arose in my mind, almost out of nowhere: what
    does it mean to predict bankruptcy? Does it mean a merchant is going bankrupt
    tomorrow? In a week? In a month? How do I know which of our merchants has already
    gone bankrupt? Is it a lack of activity? What about seasonality then? Is it some
    external information? How do I map that to a label that my algorithm can learn
    from?… I was so used to being given a labeled dataset, that I never considered
    that just creating that label requires a lot of thinking, domain knowledge and
    business considerations. And that depending on how you define the label, the problem
    and features you can use change completely.'

    that getting the correct data is a hard part of an ML problem. However, it still
    strikes you when you stumble upon this problem for the first time. Data is hard
    to get, and it is messy, and you shouldn’t trust it blindly. Building the label
    comes actually *after* you get your data sources. In my first assignment, I had
    two datasets coming from different sources, that I had to merge and map to our
    own set of features per merchant. For each new source of information you introduce,
    you need to make sure not only that the data quality is acceptable, but that you
    are not introducing any kind of [bias](https://towardsdatascience.com/survey-d4f168791e57),
    or at the very least that you account for it.'

- en: '**Evaluation**: We have our dataset and our label. We start modelling and…
    how do we measure performance? This is not only a matter of which metric to use,
    but also if it makes business sense. Trade offs play a big role here. I had never
    had to think about what metric to use to measure my model’s performance before,
    that was a given. I was literally waiting for someone to tell me: use accuracy/ROC-AUC/etc.
    When that didn’t happen, and I had to think about a metric *and the implications
    of it*, I realised how important it is to spend a lot of time thinking about this,
    and I was kind of disappointed with the little attention that this topic is given
    on any book or course I had taken. Just think about it: Depending on how “bad”
    is it to predict true when it is actually false (a.k.a False Positive) or any
    variation like this, you might want to keep a minimum precision or recall, regardless
    of how your general metric (say, ROC-AUC) goes up or down. That’s just an example,
    there are [many](/2018/06/right-metric-evaluating-machine-learning-models-2.html).'
