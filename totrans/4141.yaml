- en: How do you stay up to date as a Python developer? This is an important question
    as it is one of the most important things you can do for your career and continue
    to grow. Technology is moving at a fast rate and it can be difficult to keep on
    top of all the changes and what’s specifically happening in your specialized programming
    language.

    News section where you can find the most recent articles about Python... but also
    understand that you will see a lot of articles about the actual snake.

    Python, which has been around since 2012\. If you want to stay current with Python,
    what a better place to get that information from than a dedicated team that is
    all and everything about Python!

    The point of their membership is when their owner and editor-in-chief, Dan Bader
    was frustrated with the understanding that once you’re a professional developer,
    you’re also an adult with responsibilities. Therefore, the time to sit and learn
    about new tools and aspects of Python can become very difficult. The membership
    provides you with hundreds of Python video lessons and new course content which
    is released every week with a supporting Python community to keep you going and
    available when you have questions.

    are doing with Python, and learn from them. You can find out more about these
    conferences, including Python-focused events, as well as other related conferences
    on our websites, [here](/meetings/index.html). You can also find out more on [PyCon](https://pycon.org/),
