    data, we cannot train the models to do what we want, and our expensive and powerful
    hardware becomes useless.

    than done. That’s because the [data collection process](/2021/02/6-web-scraping-tools.html)
    is often just as complex and time-intensive as setting up the actual machine learning
    models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and clean data before it can be used. But there is a way to address this challenge
    – by using synthetic data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike actual data, synthetic data isn’t collected from real-world events but
    is generated artificially. This data is made to resemble a real dataset. You can
    [use this synthetic data](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-real-deal-about-synthetic-data/)
    to detect inherent patterns, hidden interactions, and correlations between variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All you need to do is design a machine learning model that can comprehend how
    the real data behaves, looks, and interacts. Then, the model can be queried, and
    millions of additional synthetic records can be generated that act, look, and
    feel like the real data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, there isn’t anything magical about synthetic data, but if you want to create
    high-quality synthetic data, you need to follow a few basics. For instance, your
    synthetic data will be based on the actual data used to make it. So, if you use
    poor-quality data points, you can’t expect it to deliver a high-quality synthetic
    dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To expect high-quality data as your output, you need high-quality data as your
    input. Besides that, it should also be plentiful, so you have enough input to
    expand your existing dataset with first-rate synthetic data points.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To realize how synthetic data can help you overcome data shortage, you need
    to understand the reasons behind data shortage in the first place. This is one
    of the two [biggest problems](/2022/02/common-data-problems-solutions.html) with
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For starters, available data may be insufficient for AI/ML models. Due to data
    privacy laws, enterprises need explicit permission to use sensitive customer data.
    And it can be challenging to find enough users, customers, or employees who would
    agree to let their data be handed over for research purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides this, [machine learning models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/windows-ml/what-is-a-machine-learning-model)
    cannot integrate with dated data. The reason is that they require new trends or
    must be able to respond to novel processes, technologies, or product features.
    So, historical data is of little to no use, limiting the data collection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, the sample sizes are usually small due to the nature of the data itself.
    For instance, you might only get data once a month for a customer price index
    in a model that measures the sensitivity of stock prices. Even if you go for historical
    data, you would only obtain 600 records for 50 years of CPI history - clearly,
    a very small data set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some instances, the effort to label data is not cost-effective or timely.
    For example, to predict customer satisfaction and measure customer sentiment,
    the ML model needs to manually inspect many text messages, emails, and service
    calls, but that requires an excessive number of hours, the time you may not have.

    issues.

    variables, making it difficult to make a prediction. You are also limited from
    obtaining more data for this marginal class. In this case, [synthetic data](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/08/what-is-synthetic-data/)
    can come to the rescue. It will allow you to synthesize more data points for the
    marginal class and balance your model, increasing performance.

    or an apple just by understanding the characteristics of both fruits, such as
    their shape, color, seasonality, etc. For that, you have 500 samples for oranges
    and 3,000 samples for apples. So, when the ML model tries to analyze the data,
    its algorithm is expected to be automatically biased towards apples due to the
    enormous class imbalance. Hence, the model will be inaccurate and deliver you
    unsatisfactory performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only way you can address this imbalance is by using synthetic data. Generate
    2500 more samples for oranges to give the model enough data to not be biased toward
    either of the fruits. The prediction will be more accurate now. In the same way,
    you can also effectively use this model to [manage the online reputation](https://www.getweave.com/reputation-management/)
    of your business as you can sort the good online reviews from the bad ones.

    that it includes sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII),
    social security numbers, full names, bank account numbers, etc. Since [privacy
    is of utmost importance](https://privacycanada.net/online-privacy-guide/), this
    data must be guarded carefully. Now, suppose you wish to analyze this data or
    build a model. But since you’re dealing with PII, you won’t be able to share this
    data with a third party without bringing in legal teams, using only non-personally
    identifiable information, anonymizing data, implementing secure data transfer
    processes, and much more.
  prefs: []

    immediately. Here, [synthetic samples can come in handy](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/synthetic-data-may-be-solution-to-ai-privacy-concerns)

    you won’t risk your data privacy being invaded and personal information leaks.

    adversarial network (GAN) models advance the precision of synthesized tabular
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another recent advancement in creating synthetic data is Wasserstein GAN or
    WGAN. The critic neural network tries to find the minimal distance between the
    distribution observed in produced samples and the distribution of the data observed
    in the used training set. Then, WGAN trains the generator model to generate more
    realistic data. To predict the probability of the realness of the generated images,
    it keeps the score of an images’ realness instead of utilizing a discriminator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike GANs, WGAN does not pursue stability by looking for an equilibrium between
    two contrasting models. Instead, the [WGAN seeks a junction](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-code-a-wasserstein-generative-adversarial-network-wgan-from-scratch/)
    between the models. As a result, it generates synthetic data with features more
    similar to real life.

    overcome data shortage will become more likely over time as you can generate and
    use synthetic data more efficiently. Synthetic data will also help maintain user
    privacy and keep enterprises compliant while also enhancing the speed and intelligence
    of ML models.
