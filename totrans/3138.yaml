- en: Deep Learning, one of the subfields of Machine Learning and Statistical Learning
    has been advancing in impressive levels in the past years. Cloud computing, robust
    open source tools and vast amounts of available data have been some of the levers
    for these impressive breakthroughs. The criteria used to select the 20 top papers
    is by using citation counts from [**academic.microsoft.com**](http://academic.microsoft.com).
    It is important to mention that these metrics are changing rapidly so the citations
    valued must be considered as the numbers when this article was published.

    specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Almost 50% of them refer to
    pattern recognition applications in the field of computer vision. I believe tools
    like TensorFlow, Theano and advancements in the use of GPUs have paved the way
    for data scientists and machine learning engineers to extend the field.

    previous millennium. Shallow and deep learners are distinguished by the depth
    of their credit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal
    links between actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating
    the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning
    & evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep
    and large networks.
