    that makes agriculture more efficient and effective with the help of high-precision
    algorithms. The mechanism that drives it is Machine Learning — the scientific
    field that gives machines the ability to learn without being strictly programmed.
    It has emerged together with big data technologies and high-performance computing
    to create new opportunities to unravel, quantify, and understand data intensive
    processes in agricultural operational environments.

    It begins with a seed being planted in the soil — from the soil preparation, seeds
    breeding and water feed measurement — and it ends when robots pick up the harvest
    determining the ripeness with the help of computer vision.

    determine the effectiveness of water and nutrients use, adaptation to climate
    change, disease resistance, as well as nutrients content or a better taste. Machine
    learning, in particular, deep learning algorithms, take decades of field data
    to analyze crops performance in various climates and new characteristics developed
    in the process. Based on this data they can build a probability model that would
    predict which genes will most likely contribute a beneficial trait to a plant.

    results analyzing the leaf vein morphology which carries more information about
    the leaf properties.

    with complex processes and vague mechanisms. Its temperature alone can give insights
    into the climate change effects on the regional yield. Machine learning algorithms
    study evaporation processes, soil moisture and temperature to understand the dynamics

    of daily, weekly, or monthly evapotranspiration allowing for a more effective
    use of irrigation systems and prediction of daily dew point temperature, which
    helps identify expected weather phenomena and estimate evapotranspiration and

    agriculture as it defines yield mapping and estimation, matching of crop supply
    with demand, and crop management. State-of the-art approaches have gone far beyond
    simple prediction based on the historical data, but incorporate computer vision
    technologies to provide data on the go and comprehensive multidimensional analysis
    of crops, weather, and economic conditions to make the most of the yield for farmers

- en: Both in open-air and greenhouse conditions, the most widely used practice in
    pest and disease control is to uniformly spray pesticides over the cropping area.
    To be effective, this approach requires significant amounts of pesticides which
    results in a high financial and significant environmental cost. ML is used as
    a part of the general precision agriculture management, where agro-chemicals input
    is targeted in terms of time, place and affected plants.

    The biggest problem in weeds fighting is that they are difficult to detect and
    discriminate from crops. Computer vision and ML algorithms can improve detection
    and discrimination of weeds at low cost and with no environmental issues and side
    effects. In future, these technologies will drive robots that will destroy weeds,
    minimizing the need for herbicides.

    estimation of farming parameters to optimize the economic efficiency of livestock
    production systems, such as cattle and eggs production. For example, weight predicting
    systems can estimate the future weights 150 days prior to the slaughter day, allowing

    farm. Animals behavior classifiers can connect their chewing signals to the need
    in diet changes and by their movement patterns, including standing, moving, feeding,
    and drinking, they can tell the amount of stress the animal is exposed to and
    predict its susceptibility to diseases, weight gain and production.

    He needs someone to talk through the various options to take a final decision.

    Alexa and similar helpers, since they would be able not only to give figures,

    that the most popular models in agriculture are Artificial and Deep Neural Networks

    model of the structure of the biological neural network emulating complex functions
    such as pattern generation, cognition, learning, and decision making. Such models
    are typically used for regression and classification tasks which prove their usefulness
    in crop management and detection of weeds, diseases, or specific characteristics.
    The recent development of ANNs into deep learning that has expanded the scope
    of ANN application in all domains, including agriculture.

    classify data instances. SVMs are used for classification, regression, and clustering.
    In farming, they are used to predict yield and quality of crops as well as livestock
    production.

    into artificial intelligence systems. At present, machine learning solutions tackle
    individual problems, but with further integration of automated data recording,
    data analysis, machine learning, and decision-making into an interconnected system,
    farming practices would change into with the so-called knowledge-based agriculture
    that would be able to increase production levels and products quality.
