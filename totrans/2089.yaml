    as a mix or blend of different "expert" models working together to deal with or
    respond to complex data inputs. When it comes to AI, every expert in an MoE model
    specializes in a much larger problem—just like every doctor specializes in their
    medical field. This improves efficiency and increases system efficacy and accuracy.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a neural network design that improves
    efficiency and performance by dynamically activating a subset of specialized networks,
    called experts, for each input. A gating network determines which experts to activate,
    leading to sparse activation and reduced computational cost. MoE architecture
    consists of two critical components: the gating network and the experts. Let''s
    break that down:'

- en: At its heart, the MoE architecture functions like an efficient traffic system,
    directing each vehicle – or in this case, data – to the best route based on real-time
    conditions and the desired destination. Each task is routed to the most suitable
    expert, or sub-model, specialized in handling that particular task. This dynamic
    routing ensures that the most capable resources are employed for each task, enhancing
    the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the model. The MoE architecture takes
    advantage of all 3 ways how to improve a model’s fidelity.

- en: The gating network acts as the decision-maker or controller within the MoE model.
    It evaluates incoming tasks and determines which expert is suited to handle them.
    This decision is typically based on learned weights, which are adjusted over time
    through training, further improving its ability to match tasks with experts. The
    gating network can employ various strategies, from probabilistic methods where
    soft assignments are tasked to multiple experts, to deterministic methods that
    route each task to a single expert.

    model, or LLM optimized for a specific subset of the problem domain. For example,
    in Mistral, different experts might specialize in understanding certain languages,
    dialects, or even types of queries. The specialization ensures each expert is
    proficient in its niche, which, when combined with the contributions of other
    experts, will lead to superior performance across a wide array of tasks.
