    of a set of fantastic notes on the fast.ai machine learning and deep learning
    learning streams that are [freely available online](http://www.fast.ai/). The
    author of all of these notes, [Hiromi Suenaga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiromis/)
    -- which, in sum, are a great supplement review material for the course or a standalone
    resource in their own right -- wanted to ensure that sufficient credit was given
    to course creators Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas in these summaries.'

    an excerpt from each post. This first series includes notes for only 3 courses,
    while subsequent summaries (for the deep learning courses) include full course
    sets. Make no mistake, however, the notes are still very informative. [Find more
    of Hiromi's notes here](https://medium.com/@hiromi_suenaga).

- en: '**Question**: What about a curse of dimensionality? There are two concepts
    you often hear — curse of dimensionality and no free lunch theorem. They are both
    largely meaningless and basically stupid and yet many people in the field not
    only know that but think the opposite so it is well worth explaining. The curse
    of dimensionality is this idea that the more columns you have, it creates a space
    that is more and more empty. There is this fascinating mathematical idea that
    the more dimensions you have, the more all of the points sit on the edge of that
    space. If you just have a single dimension where things are random, then they
    are spread out all over. Where else, if it is a square then the probability that
    they are in the middle means that they cannot be on the edge of either dimension
    so it is a little less likely that they are not on the edge. Each dimension you
    add, it becomes multiplicatively less likely that the point is not on the edge
    of at least one dimension, so in high dimensions, everything sits on the edge.
    What that means in theory is that the distance between points is much less meaningful.
    So if we assume it matters, then it would suggest that when you have lots of columns
    and you just use them without being careful to remove the ones you do not care
    about that things will not work. This turns out not to be the case for number
    of reasons.'

- en: '**Question**: Could you explain the difference between a validation set and
    a test set [20:58]? One of the things we are going to learn today is how to set
    hyper parameters. Hyper parameters are tuning parameters that are going to change
    how your model behaves. If you just have one holdout set (i.e. one set of data
    that you are not using to train with) and we use that to decide which set of hyper
    parameter to use. If we try a thousand different sets of hyper parameters, we
    may end up overfitting to that holdout set. So what we want to do is to have a
    second holdout set (the test set) where we can say I have done the best I can
    and now just once right at the end, I am going to see whether it works.'

- en: You must actually remove the second holdout set (test set) from the data, give
    it to somebody else, and tell them not let you look at it until you promise you
    are finished. Otherwise it is so hard not to look at it. In the world of psychology
    and sociology, it is known as replication crisis or P-hacking. That is why we
    want to have a test set.

- en: '**Importance of good validation set**: If you do not have a good validation
    set, it is hard, if not impossible, to create a good model. If you are trying
    to predict next month’s sales and you build models. If you have no way of knowing
    whether the models you have built are good at predicting sales a month ahead of
    time, then you have no way of knowing whether it is actually going to be any good
    when you put your model in production. You need a validation set that you know
    is reliable at telling you whether or not your model is likely to work well when
    you put it in production or use it on the test set.'

- en: Normally you should not use your test set for anything other than using it right
    at the end of the competition or right at the end of the project to find out how
    you did. But there is one thing you can use the test set for in addition — that
    is to calibrate your validation set.
