    the training data in the best manner, so that outcomes are satisfying. So, here
    are the 6 common mistakes you need to understand to make sure your AI model is
    successful.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The use of unverified & unstructured data is one of the most common mistakes
    machine learning engineers do in AI developments. The unverified data might have
    errors such as duplication, conflicting data, lack of categorization, data conflict,
    errors and other data issues that could create anomalies during the training process.

    examine your raw data set and eliminate the unwanted or irrelevant data, helping
    your AI model work with better accuracy.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One should avoid re-using the data that has already been used to test the model.
    Hence, such mistakes should be avoided. For example, if someone has already learned
    something and has applied that knowledge to their area of work; using the same
    learnings on another area of work could lead to one being biased and repetitive
    in inferencing.

- en: Similarly, in machine learning, the same logic applies, AI can learn with the
    bulk of datasets to predict the answers accurately. Using the same training data
    on Models or AI based applications could lead the model to be biased and derive
    results which are the resultant of their previous learning. Hence, while testing
    the capabilities of your AI model, it is very important to test using the new
    datasets that were not used earlier for machine learning training.

- en: To make your AI model successful you need to use the right training data so
    that it can predict with highest level of accuracy. Lack of sufficient data for
    training is one of the primary reasons behind the failure of the model.

    of training data is varied. For deep learning, you need more quantitative as well
    as qualitative datasets to make sure it can work with the high precision.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is not possible to develop an AI model that can give a hundred per cent accurate
    results in various scenarios. Just like humans, machines could also be biased
    due to various factors such as age, gender, orientation, and income level etc.,
    which could affect the results one way or another. Hence, you need to minimize
    this by using statistical analysis to find how each personal factor is affecting
    the data and AI training data in process.

    datasets. But if AI is using the repetitive machine learning process that needs
    to be considered while training such models.

- en: Here, as a machine learning engineer, you need to make sure that your AI model
    is learning with the right strategy. To ensure this you must frequently check
    the AI training process and its results at regular intervals to get the best outcomes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, while developing the machine learning AI, you need to keep asking yourself
    important questions such as; is your data sourced from a trustworthy reliable
    source? Does your AI cover a wide demographic and is there anything else affecting
    the results?

    you need a well-defined strategy. This will not only help you to get the best
    outcomes but also to make the machine learning models more reliable among the
    end-users.

- en: Though, mentioned above are the key points you need to keep in mind while training
    your model. But training data accurately with highest level of precision is highly
    crucial in making the AI successful and work with the best level of accuracy in
    various scenarios. If your data is not properly labelled it will affect the performance
    of the model.

    training data, [**image annotation**](https://www.cogitotech.com/services/image-annotation/?utm_source=KDNuggets&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=KDBuggetsApril)
    is the precise technique to create such datasets. Getting the right labelled data
    is another challenge for AI companies while training the model. But there are
    many companies offering data labeling for machine learning and AI
