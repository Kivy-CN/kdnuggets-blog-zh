- en: I have been in the data science field for the last half-decade when python programming
    came into the trend. Back then, in 2016, neural networks and deep learning were
    just some buzzy words. At that time, there was a hype about Google self-driving
    cars and reinforcement learning. But, most of the data science enthusiasts were
    not even aware of the working of neural networks.

- en: Today in 2021, most companies are adopting a data science strategy to make more
    revenue by automating different scenarios and replacing dozens of IT people with
    a single data scientist who can automate the task of those IT people using various
    automating tools like BluePrism, UI Path, Python and machine learning algorithms.
  prefs: []

- en: That’s why most of us are working hard to learn python, machine learning, analytics,
    deep learning. Why? Because there is an excellent value for the data scientist
    in the industries. And, also people are getting a good hike in their job data
    in the data science field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, do you know in today’s time, these “automation tasks are being automated
    using another automation strategy?” The whole data science pipeline is being automated
    using a single tool.

- en: In 2019, data scientists used to spent days in data gathering, data cleaning,
    feature selection, but now we have many tools in the market that can do these
    tasks in a few minutes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, we were trying different machine learning libraries like
    logistic regression, random forest, boosting machines, naive Bayes, and other
    data science libraries to a better model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, today, we have tools like H2O, PyCaret, and many other cloud providers
    who can do the same model selection on the same data using the combination of
    other 30–50 machine learning libraries to give you the best machine learning algorithms
    for your data with least error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Things are now getting change at a fast pace. And, we are anyhow losing our
    value because everyone will trust the tool that tries more than twenty machine
    learning algorithms to come up with better accuracy than us who tries only a couple
    of machine learning libraries to come up with less accuracy.

- en: Until now, we have discussed how some automation tools are doing well in the
    machine learning area. And these tools are doing well than us because where we
    are using limited machine learning algorithm knowledge. In contrast, these tools
    are using the combination of libraries to get more efficient results by automating
    the complete EDA process providing the best possible results in less time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, what about the deep learning area where we have less command than the machine
    learning area and having limited processing power. There also we have a good amount
    of tools in the market. These tools invest a good amount of money in having the
    best processors.
  prefs: []

    network that needs more processing power to provide more accurate results.

- en: When we talk about deep learning, that is famous for handling unstructured data.
    And, 95% time, we work with images and test data here. Object detection, image
    segmentation, building chatbots, sentiment analysis, document similarity are the
    famous use cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, working on these use cases required knowledge of different deep learning
    algorithms like convolution neural network, recurrent neural network, U-Net, hourglass,
    YOLO, and many more models that need a good amount of processing power to process
    more data for better accuracy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The catch here is that when in today’s time in 2021, companies are investing
    a good amount of money in automating these complete pipeline workflows. And, we
    are busy understanding basic machine learning and deep learning model irrespective
    of the fact that we can’t afford high-end machines without any investors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each company is aware of this fact, so after five years, when these cloud-enabled
    data science tools will become more efficient and will be able to provide better
    accuracy in much less amount time, then why companies will invest in hiring us
    and not buying the subscription of those tools?

    future of data science enthusiasts. Will, there be a shortage of jobs or will
    there be fewer hirings?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, things become easier when we think differently. It is true that companies
    will keep focusing on the automated workflow of machine learning. But, remember,
    no company wants to depend on another company for their work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each company aims to build their product so that instead of depending on others,
    they can build their automated system and then sell them in the market to earn
    more revenue. So, yes, there will be a need for data scientists who can help industries
    build automation systems that can automate the task of machine learning and deep
    learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At last, we can say that the role of data scientists will be to automate the
    pipeline with optimized results. So, in the end, we will be automating the pipeline
    of machine learning workflow and let the automation decide the best features in
    the data and derive the best possible result using the best-curated algorithm.

- en: We have seen how there will be a lack of data science jobs in the next five
    years because companies will be adopting the automated pipelines of data science.
    But, there will also be high demands for data scientists who can automate data
    science pipelines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As per my thought to automate those pipelines, we first need to understand machine
    learning algorithms to build a better automated system, which will eventually
    lead to more jobs.
