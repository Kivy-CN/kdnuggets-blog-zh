    ways for startups to differentiate themselves, I’ve been working to identify baby
    steps that would allow startups to identify and create valuable data science projects
    on their own. I recently attended [MLconf 2016](http://mlconf.com/mlconf-2016-sf/),
    an event bringing together a nice mix of academics, product leaders, and practicing
    data scientists.

    bigger and more established companies are attacking these challenges. The talks
    were a mix of recipes, reflections, and advice. Since I have more of an engineering
    mind, some of the content was over my head. Overall, though, I learned so much
    from the presenters and other attendees. I walked away with some thoughts on how
    we as startup product leaders might best tackle data science challenges. I wanted
    to try to organize these thoughts as a playbook others could use for getting started.

    standalone industry. There is no shortage of platforms, tools, and algorithms
    available from a variety of vendors to tackle just about any application. On the
    other hand, finding experts with availability to tackle your challenges is a different
    matter. The big companies are all at war to lure away each other’s data scientists.
    That doesn’t leave much opportunity for the rest of us who are looking to build
    the next great chatbot or insight-driven application.

    make this person your partner in planning and executing your projects. Meanwhile,
    understand that data scientists many times don’t have the same expertise and experience
    as other engineers in building and scaling all the other complex parts of applications.
    Be sure to get both data scientists and engineers involved in the planning of
    projects to best ensure success.

    leaders still pursue meaningful data science-driven features for their applications?
    I advocate for an extremely practical approach — as with most other product planning
    processes, get ready for a number of trade-offs. Luckily, the highly competitive
    environment of tools and platforms means that almost any dreamy feature can be
    built. For a product leader, then, the focus needs to be on finding the right
    feature and balancing the implications.

    at the conference. Slack has a lot of interesting ways they look at product, particularly

    way to identify the least amount of work required to establish that we have solved
    a customer’s problem. Josh advocates for Minimum Viable Data Products as a way
    to balance “the vision of what’s possible with what is necessary.” Slack chose
    a small set of features — channel recommendations, as an example — then strove
    to identify the lowest effort, most-easily-measurable way to validate that it
    made the customer’s experience better.

    can quickly prove that a feature is valuable to customers*. Once that value is
    established, then additional layers of complexity can be added on top. With data
    science projects in particular, though, it’s important to guard against too much
    complexity up front to reduce the chance that a given project won’t get off the
    ground.

    but they may not yet have the experience and expertise to do this all on their
    own today. A data scientist provides a higher-level understanding of the possibilities
    in a given dataset, the right tool/technique to build a feature, and then (and
    equally important) how to put it into production. Fortunately, the internet is
    full of courses, learning materials, applications, and APIs that can help companies
    launch data science features even if they don’t have their own data scientist.

    customer satisfaction will be measured. Given the additional complexities of data
    science projects, it’s even more important to create a tight loop between customer
    feedback and feature iteration. With the enormous dependency on data and potentially
    complicated models, it can be difficult for teams to isolate exactly why a given
    feature isn’t as effective as planned. The product leader has an important role
    in understanding how much work is anticipated for each iteration and will likely
    have to make judgment calls in terms of the value of additional work. Sometimes,
    it may be necessary to abandon a feature altogether if it seems that too much
    work will be required or if the results remain unpredictable.

    were just part of the portfolio of their product investments. He continued that
    in most cases, one or two of those efforts will pay for all of the rest of them.
    Getting started at data science is really hard — he called it an act of faith.
    He said companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are already way over that
    initial hump and now data science drives almost everything they do. Machine learning
    and data science are the tools those companies are using to create value, and
    user experience becomes a function of delivering insights and opportunities to
    make customers’ lives easier through automation.

    science features into their own applications. While catching up with the big companies
    may be a challenge, we need to stay focused on the needs of our own customers
    and work to make their experience better in the most reasonable way possible.
