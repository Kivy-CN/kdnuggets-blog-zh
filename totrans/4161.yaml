    patterns and experiences that inform algorithms and allow them to continually
    infer new patterns from data. To support the creation of new and exciting ML and
    artificial intelligence (AI) applications, developers need a robust programming
    language. That's where the Python programming language comes in.

    developers use, and for good reason. Let's take a quick look at why Python is
    the perfect choice when getting started in AI/ML development and some of its different
    applications for ML.

    understand why Python is such an effective language for programming ML applications.
    Basically, ML refers to the mathematical models - [what we call algorithms](/2016/08/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers.html)
    - that let ML applications predict things such as categories or other continuous
    values. They modulate their data input to make these predictions, and they use
    different parameters that they derive from their data inputs to do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ML models rely on the above process to continuously and iteratively learn. They
    take in their input and make their best possible prediction of the continuous
    value they need to arrive at. They further refine their ability to make predictions
    by means of a loss function that lets the model know how far off it is from the
    desired data output. This process is repeated many times to gradually improve
    accuracy.

    [are often used interchangeably](https://dataconomy.com/2021/05/machine-learning-vs-artificial-intelligence-future-data-science/),
    they are not the same. Different types of machine learning algorithms are better
    suited to different functions, but deep learning and reinforcement learning are
    the subfields that  primarily enable the functions that make up our common understanding
    of AI.

- en: Python has become the go-to language for programming ML applications in large
    part because of its readability. Python is simple to learn, accessible to developers
    of all experience levels, and highly portable since it can run on all popular
    operating systems. The biggest factor that lends to its [popularity among ML developers](/2019/05/poll-top-data-science-machine-learning-platforms.html),
    though, is its large ecosystem. The majority of ML algorithms can be implemented
    with Python as a framework.

    with data and need ML applications to iteratively learn from those data sets.
    Most developers will [charge at least $75 an hour for work](https://www.freshbooks.com/hub/estimates/how-much-do-web-designers-charge)
    on a development project if they’re reasonably skilled, which means that Python-based
    projects can at least be relatively inexpensive when handled by a team of experienced
    developers. And in the unlikely event that a development team runs into problems,
    Python's active community can readily provide support on question-and-answer platforms
    such as StackOverflow, Reddit, and Yahoo.

    valuable to B2B organizations that need to better [analyze customer trends](https://www.syntax.com/sap-machine-learning-what-you-should-know/)
    for competitive research and predictive planning. The larger the sets of data
    a development team has access to, the more accurately ML applications can predict
    customer trends using behavioral analytics. ML-powered analysis of customer behavior
    requires continuously growing sets of data, which means development teams must
    create powerful computational processing models to keep up.

- en: There are some basic concepts that provide useful context for developers who
    are exploring ML with Python. One of the most fundamental of these concepts is
    that of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Supervised algorithms handle data that are labeled manually by developers and
    that [use target variables](/2021/12/beginner-guide-end-end-machine-learning.html)
    for each data point. Supervised algorithms are relatively expensive compared to
    unsupervised ones, which handle unlabeled data and discern underlying regularities
    in their input by themselves.

- en: Supervised and [unsupervised learning applications](https://pythonistaplanet.com/applications-of-unsupervised-learning/)
    contribute to the ways ML improves customer analytics. Both types of algorithms
    can pull data to predict behavioral patterns and detect precisely when customers
    need assistance while shopping. This ensures a greater number of customers continues
    along their sales process without encountering complications. It can even help
    organizations identify and contact prospects before those prospects contact them,
    improving sales success and enhancing the overall customer experience.

    ML applications that predict categories and continuous values. Classification
    algorithms use classifiers that handle [binary problems](/2021/12/introduction-binary-classification-pycaret.html)
    (for example, true or false) or multiclass distinctions to predict categories
    (for example, categorical animal types). In contrast, regression models predict
    continuous values such as house prices.

    fraudulent behavior or suspicious network activity. Hackers are relentless, and
    once they’ve gained entry or access to a website, they are likely using the site
    to either infect other people or providers. Machine learning powers AI-based security
    monitoring systems that  help security professionals [detect and respond to breaches](https://bestwebhostingaustralia.org/website-hacking/),
    decreasing the risk that an attack will spread throughout the network.

    and it makes use of many important concepts that developers can explore with Python.
    Although this article covers some of the most common ML concepts, it's important
    that developers [gain a larger understanding of ML in practice](/2021/10/20-python-packages.html)
    by choosing problems that interest them or their organizations. From there, developers
    can both work on their own ML projects and apply their improved understanding
    of ML models in the workplace.
