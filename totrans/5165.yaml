- en: When working with databases, the question will often arise whether a person
    should use structured query language (SQL) or object-relational mapping (ORM).
    Here’s an overview of the two to help people make educated decisions about this
    matter.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL allows people to interact with relational databases by using specific queries.
    A relational database stores information in fields and usually organizes the content
    in rows and columns. Each database a person works with typically contains at least
    one table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL is the programming language that allows the [individual to pull up or modify](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_syntax.asp)
    the desired information when working with the database. They’d do that by inputting
    non-case-sensitive queries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the CREATE DATABASE command makes a new database, while the INSERT
    INTO command moves information into one. Those are two straightforward types of
    queries. However, depending on what someone needs to do, they can get much more
    complicated. In those cases, a distracted developer could become more likely to
    make an error.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Object-relational mapping lets people interact with databases in their programming
    languages of choice rather than forcing them to use SQL. Developers can use tools
    called object-relational mappers. They show the data in a structured way that
    helps users understand the content and layout of a database without using SQL.
    One of the major [benefits is that it saves time](https://dev.to/tinazhouhui/introduction-to-object-relational-mapping-the-what-why-when-and-how-of-orm-nb2)
    compared to entering SQL queries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As people’s interactions with data become more complex, so do the length of
    SQL queries to input. That reality increases the likelihood of errors. Things
    also get more complicated since there are multiple ways to write questions and
    get the same result.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An object-relational mapper works as a translator that converts code from one
    form to another. The tool creates objects representing a virtual map of the database.
    The user can then interact with the objects rather than directly engaging with
    code.

    few things to keep in mind that can help them reach the right decisions for their
    situations.

- en: Any [comprehensive data security approach](https://datamotion.com/best_practices_-securing_data_at_rest_in-use_and_in_motion/)
    must protect information at rest, in use and in transit. SQL injection attacks
    allow malicious parties to tamper with stored data. Many things can make these
    incidents more likely, but old or error-ridden code are some of the main culprits.
    Using parameterized queries is one best practice for avoiding SQL injection attacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many ORM tools parameterize some types of queries by default. That allows them
    to prevent some SQL attacks. Using an ORM is not a foolproof way to stop them,
    but it can reduce their likelihood.

- en: Data showed that [47.8% of developers worldwide](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/)
    used SQL in 2021\. That’s an overall minority but is still a substantial percentage.
    Someone who does not use SQL as often as they’d like or does not feel very comfortable
    may prefer using ORM instead. They may then be less likely to make mistakes, especially
    with complex queries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, some developers point out that the availability of [ORMs is no excuse](https://tylerclark.dev/orm-vs-vanilla-sql/)
    to shy away from learning SQL. An ORM still requires setup and configuration before
    people can work with it.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to consider about using an ORM versus SQL is that the former option
    can sacrifice some speed. As a result, people [may find their productivity reduced](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/object-relational-mapping-orm-supun-ishara-weerasekara)
    when running complex queries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If people worry about making mistakes when inputting complex queries with SQL,
    they might find the slower speed an acceptable tradeoff for the improved accuracy
    an ORM tool allows. However, someone with years of experience with SQL and who
    is confident in their abilities may not want to use an ORM tool and experience
    the slower processing speed.

- en: '**Vendor Lock-In Possibilities**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using ORM means always relying on a third-party tool when working with a database.
    SQL does not. If a person does not like the idea of needing a vendor’s product
    to make database changes, it’s better to have someone else with strong SQL skills
    do the job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are numerous ORM products on the market, and it’s not always easy to determine
    which is the best one to meet an organization’s needs. Perhaps decision-makers
    have yet to reach that conclusion, and they need database work done soon. In that
    case, SQL allows someone to complete the task before a company gets around to
    purchasing the ORM.

- en: '**Ease of Troubleshooting**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL requires developers to work directly with code. That means it’s often easier
    for them to carry out low-level troubleshooting because they can see exactly what
    queries got them to a certain point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ORM works with a layer between the developer and the code, so it’s not easy
    to see what’s happening in the background. That aspect makes troubleshooting more
    complicated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**No Universally Best Choice**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many developers will likely use SQL and ORM at different times. That’s because
    there are instances when one is clearly the more appropriate option. However,
    it’s too short-sighted to say that one is the best choice in all cases. With that
    in mind, developers should think about factors such as the project’s scope, the
    organization’s needs and their abilities before determining which one to use.
