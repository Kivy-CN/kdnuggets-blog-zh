- en: There are many courses and resources available on machine learning and data
    science, but very few on data engineering. This raises some questions. Is it a
    difficult field? Is it offering low pay? Is it not considered as exciting as other
    tech roles? However, the reality is that many companies are actively seeking data
    engineering talent and offering substantial salaries, sometimes exceeding $200,000
    USD. Data engineers play a crucial role as the architects of data platforms, designing
    and building the foundational systems that enable data scientists and machine
    learning experts to function effectively.
