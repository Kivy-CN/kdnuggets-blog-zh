    Research has come a long way, from simple description statistics to text classification
    and advanced text generation. With the addition of the Large Language Model in
    our arsenal, our working tasks become even more accessible.

    the power of LLM. This package stood out because we could integrate the standard
    Scikit-Learn pipeline with the Scikit-LLM.

    to enhance text data analytic tasks via LLM. It was developed by [Beatsbyte](https://beastbyte.ai/)
    to help bridge the standard Scikit-Learn library and the power of the language
    model. Scikit-LLM created its API to be similar to the SKlearn library, so we
    don’t have too much trouble using it.'

    code.

    some of the OpenAI and GPT4ALL Models. That’s why we would only going to work
    with the OpenAI model. However, you can use the GPT4ALL model by installing the
    component initially.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s try out some Scikit-LLM capabilities with the environment set. One ability
    that LLMs have is to perform text classification without retraining, which we
    call Zero-Shot. However, we would initially try a Few-Shot text classification
    with the sample data.

    in the dataset. In this case, the label consists of the sentiment, which is Positive,
    Neutral, or Negative.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can see, the process is similar to using the fitting method in the Scikit-Learn
    package. However, we already know that Zero-Shot didn’t necessarily require a
    dataset for training. That’s why we can provide the labels without the training
    data.

    and use XGBoost as the model classifier. We would also wrap the steps into the
    model pipeline.

    which I suggest you check the documentation to learn further. You can also use
    the open-source model from [GPT4ALL](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) if necessary.
