- en: If you have a basic knowledge of data science and your writing skills are good,
    you can earn a handsome amount of money just by writing articles. [Medium](https://medium.com/) is
    the best platform for beginners to get started with writing. Along with this,
    there are different websites that pay writers for original blogs. You can write
    for those websites, or you can even start your own blog (this will not only help
    you financially, but it will also improve your resume as well). In the case of
    your own blog, you will write blogs related to AI/ML/DL/DS. Once your blog reaches
    a certain threshold (views/traffic-wise), you can apply for monetization. If your
    monetization is enabled, then you will earn money for every view of your blog.

    2020–21 when everything is locked down and people are in their homes. So, you
    can start doing freelance work regarding data science on websites like [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/), [freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/),
    etc. And as you complete more and more projects, your profile becomes more valuable,
    and you start to get more orders.

    crystal clear. So focusing on the above saying, you can teach data science at
    your university as an assistant professor or start an academy at home or somewhere
    that teaches data science. Start from the beginner level and change things along
    the way. By starting to teach, you not only earn a reasonable amount of money,
    but you also start giving back to the programmer's community.

    are a game-changer. This is because some data science skills can only be solidified
