- en: Skeptical detective. Signal-extractor. Possessed. If you’re a data scientist,
    it’s entirely legitimate for you to claim one (or all) of these identities as
    your own. At least, so say some of the leading innovators in data science today.
    In these quotes, they share their advice and insights drawn from years of experience
    to address the field’s most pressing questions. The list is designed to help both
    aspiring and established data scientists advance their careers, and also to spark
    some intelligent conversation at your next data science meetup.
