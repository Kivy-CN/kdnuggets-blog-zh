    open-source ecosystem. **[EvalML](https://github.com/alteryx/evalml)** is a library
    for automated machine learning (AutoML) and model understanding, written in Python.

- en: EvalML provides a simple, unified interface for building machine learning models,
    using those models to generate insights and to make accurate predictions. EvalML
    provides access to multiple modeling libraries under the same API. EvalML supports
    a variety of supervised machine learning problem types including regression, binary
    classification and multiclass classification. Custom objective functions let users
    phrase their search for a model directly in terms of what they value. Above all
    we’ve aimed to make EvalML stable and performant, with ML performance testing
    on every release.

- en: EvalML pipelines produced by AutoML include preprocessing and feature engineering
    steps out of the box. Once users have identified the target column of the data
    which they’d like to model, EvalML’s AutoML will run a search algorithm to train
    and score a collection of models, will enable users to select one or more models
    from that collection, and to then use those models for insight-driven analysis
    or to generate predictions.

    which can integrate data from multiple tables and generate features to turbocharge
    ML models, and with [Compose](https://compose.alteryx.com/), a tool for label
    engineering and time series aggregation. EvalML users can easily control how EvalML
    will treat each inputted feature, as a numeric feature, a categorical feature,
    text, date-time, etc.

- en: EvalML models are represented using a pipeline data structure, composed of a
    graph of components. Every operation applied to your data by AutoML is recorded
    in the pipeline. This makes it easy to turn from selecting a model to deploying
    a model. It's also easy to define custom components, pipelines and objectives
    in EvalML, whether for use in AutoML or as standalone elements.

    match your data and your domain. This allows you to articulate what makes a model
    valuable in your domain, and to then use AutoML to find models which deliver that
    value.

    and after the search process. Using a custom objective will help guide the AutoML
    search towards models which are the highest impact. Custom objectives will also
    be used by AutoML to tune the classification threshold of binary classification
    models.

    before they cause model quality problems or mysterious bugs and stack traces.
    Current data checks include a simple approach to detecting [target leakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(machine_learning)),
    where the model is given access to information during training which won’t be
    available at prediction-time, detection of invalid datatypes, high class imbalance,
    highly null columns, constant columns, and columns which are likely an ID and
    not useful for modeling.
