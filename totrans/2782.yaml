    privacy concerns. This is especially true when it comes to training machine learning
    models with data obtained from the interaction of users with devices such as smartphones.

    learning models without sharing personally-identifiable data? That is the question
    that we’ll seek to answer in this look at a technique known as federated learning.

- en: The traditional process for training a machine learning model involves uploading
    data to a server and using that to train models. This way of training works just
    fine as long as the privacy of the data is not a concern.

    identifiable data is involved (on-device, or in industries with particularly sensitive

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Federated learning is a model training technique that enables devices to learn
    collaboratively from a shared model. The shared model is first trained on a server
    using proxy data. Each device then downloads the model and improves it using data
    — *federated data —* from the device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The device trains the model with the locally available data. The changes made
    to the model are summarized as an update that is then sent to the cloud. The training
    data and individual updates remain on the device. In order to ensure faster uploads
    of theses updates, the model is compressed using random rotations and quantization.
    When the devices send their specific models to the server, the models are averaged
    to obtain a single combined model. This is done for several iterations until a
    high-quality model is obtained.
