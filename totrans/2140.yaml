  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Experimental Prompts**: Similar to the iterative and experimental development
    of machine learning models, data scientists can also experiment with prompts with
    varying levels of guidelines. This is an essential skill for budding data scientists,
    primarily because ChatGPT tends to assume any missing information rather than
    ask for it. A typical example would be an instruction asking ChatGPT to read a
    file and do some processing over the data, which can result in it assuming that
    the input file is a CSV. This may or may not be true, depending upon your use
    case. Thus, experimenting with incremental guidelines is often a best practice.'

    As a quick reference, CoT is a technique that invokes the reasoning process of
    LLMs by providing them with a few-shot examples, explicitly outlining the reasoning
    process. The model then follows a similar reasoning process to answer the prompt,
    thereby improving the model's performance on tasks that require complex reasoning.
