    the world involved in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy techniques for protein
    structure and disorder characterization. dSPP data are derived from solution and
    solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy experiments for 7200+ unrelated
    proteins studied under physiologically-relevant conditions.

    (IDPs), which are a challenging class of proteins to study. IDPs are implicated
    in numerous debilitating human pathologies, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,
    prion diseases, molecular basis of cancer, HIV, HSV, HVC, ZIKVR, and many others.

    structural stability of secondary structure motifs, as well as high throughput
    computational techniques, which aim to deliver realistic models of medically relevant
    proteins.

- en: As opposed to binary (*logits*) secondary structure assignments available in
    other protein datasets for experimentalists and the machine learning community,
    dSPP data report on protein structure and local dynamics at the residue level
    with atomic resolution, as gauged from continuous structural propensity assignment
    in a **range -1.0 to 1.0**.
