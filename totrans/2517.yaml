- en: One of the biggest promises of machine learning was that it would make things
    easier by computerizing human cognition. More enterprises are implementing machine
    learning (ML) to improve revenue and operations as they digitally transform their
    businesses. But with all the promise and opportunity behind ML, it can quickly
    make life harder for the teams tasked with managing it in production.

    predicting prices, detecting fraud, classifying health risks, processing documents,
    preventive maintenance, and more. Models are trained and evaluated on historical
    data until they appear to fit targets for performance and accuracy.  The results
    promise high business value by predicting, classifying, or prescribing future
    outcomes—and taking action. Enterprises are keen to reap the benefits that ML
    promises.'

    mechanisms introduces operational complexities and risks that need careful attention.
    Delivery and operational teams must holistically manage the ML lifecycle to make
    these projects efficient and effective. Data must be available and of the expected
    quality compared to what was used to train. Other complexities begin to emerge
    for the business as realization sets in:  this isn’t quite like other engineering
    efforts, and you need to start thinking about the problem differently to truly
    become an AI-powered company.  To succeed with machine learning, and specifically
    with ML models, here are three things you should consider:'

    the right fit.

- en: ML models are never right the first time, the second time... or usually even
    the third time!  Data between training and production rarely matches well enough
    to get it right out of the gate. Make specific and targeted investments to have
    deployment targets that can run and log results without production systems or
    customers seeing those results, and the ability to deploy there easily and fluidly
    until you have the model you like.  It’s much more effective and cheaper in the
    long term to assume there will be a lot of optimization or tuning of your models
    and a need to compare current versions to new candidates promising better outcomes.

    learning engineers usually won’t fit within traditional, application-centric “approved
    software” policies.

- en: Machine learning is a rapidly growing and diversifying field, with a constantly
    expanding list of technology providers, both large and small.  No one questions
    that IT needs to maintain proper controls, security scans, and support for your
    operating environments.  However, applying the same controls and processes for
    governing operating or product hosting technology to your machine learning practice
    is likely to greatly diminish the returns you will receive over time before you’ve
    ever crossed the starting line.  Additionally, many data scientists are strong
    technologists and inventors and could quite possibly go find other employment
    if they feel they are being pressed to deliver better and better results without
    changing what technology they use or how they can leverage it.

- en: 3\. Don’t mistake the model development lifecycle for just another software
    development lifecycle
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating machine learning models is a much different process than software development
    – and trying to treat it the same way will get you in trouble. Many businesses
    currently have elected to treat model delivery as just another software release
    and end up with sequential, extended timelines, gaps in cross-cutting capabilities
    like monitoring and analysis, and high overhead for knowledge transfer between
    creators and operators.  Specialists who deploy and support your models must understand
    how the model and the data work, not just triage error codes and service reliability. 
    Find the right talent, build hybrid teams and invest in tools, so you can test
    and interpret not just whether the software is executing but also to what degree
    the responses are accurate and explainable.

- en: ML models have the potential to bring huge efficiencies and advantages to your
    organization, but keeping up with all the aspects of building and managing a sound
    model can become a full-spectrum enterprise problem. Its operational complexities
    and risks must be recognized early; consider using these and other principles
    to anticipate where your problems and challenges will arise. If managed properly,
    ML models can be highly agile, easy to change, and well worth the learning curve.
