- en: Statistics plays a pivotal role across numerous fields including data science,
    business, social sciences, and more. However, many of the foundational statistical
    concepts can seem complex and intimidating, especially for beginners without a
    strong math background. This article will look at 10 foundational statistical
    concepts in simple, non-technical terms, with the goal of conveying these concepts
    in an accessible and approachable manner.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A probability distribution shows the likelihood of different outcomes occurring
    in a process. For example, say we have a bag with an equal number of red, blue,
    and green marbles. If we draw marbles randomly, the probability distribution tells
    us the chances of drawing each color. It would show that there's an equal 1/3
    chance or 33% probability of getting red, blue, or green. Many types of real-world
    data can often be modeled using known probability distributions, although this
    is not always the case.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hypothesis testing allows us to make claims based on data, similar to how a
    courtroom trial aims to prove guilt or innocence based on available evidence.
    We start with a hypothesis or claim, called the null hypothesis. Then we check
    if the observed data supports or refutes this claim within a certain confidence
    level. For example, a drug manufacturer may claim their new medicine reduces pain
    faster than existing ones. Researchers can test this claim by analyzing results
    from clinical trials. Based on the data, they can either reject the claim if evidence
    is lacking or fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there isn't
    enough evidence to say the new drug does not reduce pain faster.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When sampling data from a population, confidence intervals provide a range of
    values within which we can be reasonably sure that the true mean of the population
    lies. For example, if we state that the average height of men in a country is
    172 cm with a 95% confidence interval of 170 cm to 174 cm, then we are 95% confident
    that the mean height for all men lies between 170 cm and 174 cm. The confidence
    interval generally gets smaller with larger sample sizes, assuming other factors
    like variability remain constant.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regression analysis helps us understand how changes in one variable impact another
    variable. For instance, we can analyze data to see how sales are impacted by advertising
    expenditure. The regression equation then quantifies the relationship, allowing
    us to predict future sales based on projected ad spends. Beyond two variables,
    multiple regression incorporates several explanatory variables to isolate their
    individual effects on the outcome variable.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ANOVA lets us compare means across multiple groups to see if they are significantly
    different. For example, a retailer might test customer satisfaction with three
    packaging designs. By analyzing survey ratings, ANOVA can confirm whether satisfaction
    levels differ across the three groups. If differences exist, it means not all
    designs lead to equal satisfaction. This insight helps choose the optimal packaging.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The p-value indicates the probability of getting results at least as extreme
    as the observed data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value provides
    strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you may consider rejecting it
    in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Going back to the clinical trials example,
    a small p-value when comparing pain relief of the new and standard drugs would
    indicate strong statistical evidence that the new drug does act faster.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While frequentist statistics relies solely on data, Bayesian statistics incorporates
    existing beliefs along with new evidence. As we get more data, we update our beliefs.
    For example, say the probability of actually raining today based on forecasts
    is 50%. If we then notice dark clouds overhead, Bayes' theorem tells us how to
    update this probability to say 70% based on the new evidence. Bayesian methods,
    which can be computationally intensive, can be popular in aspects of data science.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard deviation quantifies how dispersed or spread out data is from the
    mean. A low standard deviation means points cluster closely around the mean, while
    a high standard deviation indicates wider variation. For example, test scores
    of 85, 88, 89, 90 have a lower standard deviation than scores of 60, 75, 90, 100\.
    Standard deviation is extremely useful in statistics and forms the basis of many
    analyses.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The correlation coefficient measures how strongly two variables are linearly
    related, from -1 to +1\. Values close to +/-1 indicate a strong correlation, while
    values near 0 mean a weak correlation. For example, we can calculate the correlation
    between house size and price. A strong positive correlation implies larger houses
    tend to have higher prices. It''s important to note that while correlation measures
    a relationship, it does not imply that one variable causes the other to occur.
    Everyone, together: *correlation does not imply causation!*'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The central limit theorem is more accurate when the sample size is large and
    states that when we take such samples from a population and calculate sample means,
    these means follow a normal distribution pattern, regardless of the original distribution.
    For example, if we survey groups of people about movie preferences, plot the average
    for each group, and repeat this process, the averages form a bell curve, even
    if individual opinions vary.

- en: Understanding statistical concepts provides an analytical lens through which
    to view the world and begin to interpret data so that we are able to make informed,
    evidence-based decisions. Be it in data science, business, school, or our everyday
    lives, statistics is a powerful set of tools that can provide us seemingly endless
    insight into how the world works. I hope this article has provided an intuitive
    yet comprehensive introduction to some of these ideas.
