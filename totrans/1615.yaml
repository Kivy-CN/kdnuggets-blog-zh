    Hitachi’s “Data Science 部会” is to help lead the development of Hitachi’s data
    science capabilities. We have a target number of people who we want trained and
    operational by 2020, so there is definitely a sense of urgency. And I like urgency
    because it’s required to sweep aside the inhibitors and resistors to change.

    Data Integration and Data Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-difference-between-data-integration-engineering-bill-schmarzo/)?”
    that laid out the differences between traditional Data Integration and modern
    Data Engineering (see Figure 1).

    the “Data Science 部会” – which is to become more effective at leveraging data and
    analytics to optimize key business and operational processes, mitigate compliance
    and security risks, uncover new revenue opportunities and create a more compelling,
    differentiated user experience – we need to consider three key roles, and the
    interaction between those three key roles, that round out the data science community.
    We need to understand the responsibilities, capabilities, expectations and competencies
    of the Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Business Stakeholder.

    and Data Scientists at the Silicon Valley’s leading data science organizations
    (Thanks John!).  We then created a graphic to highlight the focus and capabilities
    of those roles, as well as the interactions between those roles – the Data Science
    Capabilities Venn Diagram (see Figure 2).

    Venn Diagram.  We can then use the Venn Diagrams to not only assess the current
    capabilities of the data science community, but now we have the basis, or benchmarks,
    against which we can build individualized development plans to improve the data
    science capabilities across all three roles.

     That way the Business Stakeholders can understand how best to collaborate with
    a data scientist and a data engineer to uncover the customer, product, service
    and operational insights that will drive business success.  See the blog “[Refined
