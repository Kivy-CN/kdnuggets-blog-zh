- en: Several supporting packages written in Python and R allow analysts to combine
    Python and R in one Python or R script. Those familiar with R can use the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package
    to call Python code inside R. Then, an R script is interoperable between Python
    and R (Python objects are translated into R objects and vice versa). However,
    if you use Python but want to use some functionalities of R, consider using the [rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/introduction.html) package
    written in Python to enable embedded R code.

    code and results in one output, provides an elegant Python and R integration.
    We’ll create a dynamic report combining both languages in one Rmd script. We’ll
    use [forex trading data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market) to
    capture price movements in 15 minute intervals and then plot a candlestick graph
    that trading analysts use in pricing models ([OHLC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ohlcchart.asp) charts).'

- en: An R markdown, or Rmd, is a text file containing text or commentary (combined
    with text formatting) and chunks of R code surrounded by [PRE0]{python} and [PRE1]{r}
    and ends with ```. The code is followed by a Python chunk and an object referenced
    inside the R code. In our example, the R object is converted from Python object
    with the help of reticulate package. The command py$data retrieves the object
    that is created in Python and converts it into R data frame. Now, when R data
    frame is created, it can be used further in R code.

- en: Python and R are the hottest data science languages today. It’s good to be familiar
    with both, since projects may require aspects from each. There are many packages
    to help integrate both for use-cases. One is R markdown, a file format for making
    dynamic documents in R. Rmd files integrate seamlessly executable code and commentary.
    With the help of the reticulate package, R objects can be reached easily in Python
    and vice versa. Analysts now need not choose between Python and R — it is possible
    to integrate both in one file.
