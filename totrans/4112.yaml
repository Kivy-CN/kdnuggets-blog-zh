    services, we all are accustomed to getting things done at our fingertips. The
    world has always been automating something or the other, be it using simple machines,
    assembly lines, robots, or computers for processing transactions. Humanity has
    reaped significant benefits and enjoyed ease by automating and delegating mundane
    tasks to machines.

- en: When it comes to programming, Python is a much sought-after and easy-to-use
    language used for automating some of the repeated tasks. As machine learning and
    AI become mainstream, it is widely getting prominence as it is straightforward
    to learn. Simple mundane tasks like responding to emails, downloading videos,
    sending text messages at a particular time of the day to a set of recipients,
    reading emails out loud, etc can be automated easily with the help of Python.

    you would have a messy Downloads folder. We all have faced such a situation and
    struggle with manually deleting irrelevant files which are painstakingly difficult
    – is there a solution? Certainly. Why not automatically delete some of the files,
    let’s say by type?

- en: Most commonly we end up downloading a lot of pdf files from the internet and
    thus the script shared below comes in handy to remove such files. Notably, this
    script removes all the suggested files instead of sending them to the Recycle
    Bin.

- en: The library which supports this automation is “os”. Start with importing the
    “os” library. Change your directory to the Downloads directory. Now call the “listdir()”
    function, which lists all the files and directories inside the current directory
    i.e. Downloads in our case. Loop through these files, verify if the files end
    with a “.pdf” extension, and remove the file using the ".remove(file)” method.

    For example, I generally download images from “web.whatsapp.com” and all these
    image filenames start with the “Whatsapp” substring.

    to your desktop. Pyautogui is a Python library that supports the automation of
    mouse pointer movements and keyboard key presses without any hassle.

- en: The below code types the text “This Desktop is Automated!” to the already open
    TextEdit file. First, import the library “pyautogui” with the alias name “pag”.
    Call the “doubleClick()” method with the coordinates of where you want to double-click
    as arguments. In this case, the coordinates are chosen as x = 150 and y = 150.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Please note that on a computer screen the 0,0 coordinates start from the top
    left corner with the y-axis values increasing as you move down and x-axis values
    increasing while moving rightwards.

    blinks inside the file. You can also call a “click()” method instead of a “doubleClick()”.
    “pyautogui.write()” adds the text where the blinking cursor is located.

    screenshots, thus making it a versatile option for desktop automation.

    of the circle or the length of the side of a square in each iteration. The below
    [code](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) from the official documentation
    highlights this application.

    desktop. It’s easy with “pytube”. Just import pytube, and call the Youtube().streams.first()
    method with the video URL. Save the output into the video variable and then call
    the download() method with the location for downloading the video.
