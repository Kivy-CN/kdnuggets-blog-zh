    that automates the exploration of ML models and allows for interactive examination.
    It works in a model agnostic fashion, therefore is compatible with most of the
    ML frameworks (e.g.[ mlr/mlr3, xgboost, caret, h2o, scikit-learn, lightGBM, keras/tensorflow](https://modelstudio.drwhy.ai/articles/ms-r-python-examples.html)).'

    behind this tool: [The Grammar of Interactive Explanatory Model Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00497).
    Here are the highlights.

    of a model behaviour. The second generation of model explanation aims at integration
    of individual aspects into a vibrant and multi-threaded customisable story about
    the model that address the needs of different stakeholders.

    is an increasing number of voices arguing that a single method of model exploration
    cannot fit all needs of different stakeholders (see e.g. [Arya et al 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09734) or [Sokol
    et al 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09734)). In [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00497) article
    we show how common XAI methods can be combined into larger blocks that complement
    each other. Such constructs address a wider range of user needs. In the picture
    below we show how such a juxtaposition of aspects shows the model from different
    perspectives and allows to better understand how it behaves.'

    a complex model using a single method that gives only one perspective.

    to wrong reasoning. Without multi-faceted interactive explanation, there will
    be no understanding nor trust for models.

    methods of model exploration enrich each other. Names of popular techniques are
    listed in cells. Columns and rows span the taxonomy. Edges in this graph indicate
    which method can be complemented by which.

    that each explanation raises new questions. So a good XAI system should allow
    for interactive exploration of different aspects of the model. To make this possible,
    we introduce a taxonomy of explanations and propose the grammar that generates
    the process of exploring the complex model.'

- en: The topic of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence brings much attention recently.
    However, the literature is dominated by works either focused on a list of requirements
    for its better adoption or contributions with a very technical approach to explaining
    only a single aspect of the model. In the paper, we propose **a third way**. First,
    we argue that explaining a single aspect of the model is incomplete. Second, we
    propose a taxonomy of methods for explanations, which focuses on the needs of
    different stakeholders apparent in the lifecycle of Machine Learning models. Third,
    we describe that Interactive XAI is a process in which explanations are related
    to a sequence of analysis of complementary model aspects.

    exploration process. **If you have any suggestions and comments about this process,
    we will be happy to hear them.**
