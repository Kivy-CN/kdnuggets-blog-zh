    One of the best places to start is the [Statistics Foundations](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/statistics-foundations-probability-distributions)
    course from Pluralsight. It covers both descriptive statistics and inferential
    statistics.

- en: Python, R, and Julia are popular programming languages for data science projects.
    Each language has unique merits. Python is the most popular data science language,
    and Julia is the fastest. [Core Python](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/core-python)
    is a recommended course for learning the python language.

- en: R language is the best option for beginners, academics, and domain experts.
    It is overwhelming to learn data science and a general-purpose language like Python
    in parallel. R is easier to grasp as it is a data science language. It has good
    community support.

    of artificial intelligence. Learn machine learning after mastering statistics
    and programming. The book [Linear Algebra and Learning from Data](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Learning-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0692196382/)
    covers both simple and advanced topics. It teaches linear algebra together with
    deep learning and neural nets.
