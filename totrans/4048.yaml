- en: We know that programming is a useful (essential?) skill for data scientists
    to possess. But what level of programming skill is necessary? Should a data scientist
    aim to be "good enough," or instead desire to become an expert level programmer?
    Should we aspire to be coding ninjas?

    beginner, intermediate, and expert level programmer look like $mdash; or at least
    what their *code* looks like.

    for potential beginner, intermediate, and expert level programmer approaches to
    completing that tasks, with some explanation as to the differences. This should
    give us a foundations on which to build a discussion about the importance of programming
    abilities.

    different levels. All the scripts are functional and get the job done, but they

    finding the factorial of a given number. Let's implement this task for hypothetical
    beginner, intermediate, and expert Python programmers, and compare differences
    in the code.
