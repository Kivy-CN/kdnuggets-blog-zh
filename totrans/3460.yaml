    I recommend starting with the simplest hypothesis space first -- given that you
    don't know much about your data -- and work your way up towards the more complex
    hypothesis spaces. So, the linear kernel works fine if your dataset if linearly
    separable; however, if your dataset isn't linearly separable, a linear kernel
    isn't going to cut it (almost in a literal sense ;)).

- en: Now, it looks like both linear and RBF kernel SVM would work equally well on
    this dataset. So, why prefer the simpler, linear hypothesis? Think of Occam's
    Razor in this particular case. Linear SVM is a parametric model, an RBF kernel
    SVM isn't, and the complexity of the latter grows with the size of the training
    set. Not only is it more expensive to train an RBF kernel SVM, but you also have
    to keep the kernel matrix around, and the projection into this "infinite" higher
    dimensional space where the data becomes linearly separable is more expensive
    as well during prediction. Furthermore, you have more hyperparameters to tune,
    so model selection is more expensive as well! And finally, it's much easier to
    overfit a complex model!

- en: 'In any case, I wouldn''t bother too much about the polynomial kernel. In practice,
    it is less useful for efficiency (computational as well as predictive) performance
    reasons. So, the rule of thumb is: use linear SVMs (or logistic regression) for
    linear problems, and nonlinear kernels such as the Radial Basis Function kernel
    for non-linear problems.'

    our data in 2 dimensions ... but what do we do in a real-world problem, i.e.,
    a dataset with more than 2 dimensions? Here, we want to keep an eye on our objective
    function: minimizing the hinge-loss. We would setup a hyperparameter search (grid
    search, for example) and compare different kernels to each other. Based on the
    loss function (or a performance metric such as accuracy, F1, MCC, ROC auc, etc.)
    we could determine which kernel is "appropriate" for the given task.'
