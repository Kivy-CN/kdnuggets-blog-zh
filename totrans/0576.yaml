    develop into today’s data economy. It is the critical “last mile” of communication
    that transforms your findings into something that will inspire change and create
    value. Brent Dykes has more than 15 years of enterprise analytics experience and
    will share his insights about data storytelling at Crunch Conference.**'

- en: '**Brent Dykes:** Chip and Dan Heath’s book, “Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas
    Survive and Others Die” has had a profound impact on my career. Its principles
    transformed the way I think about communication. It was also one of the first
    books that highlighted to me the power that stories have over statistics. As a
    data geek, I often thought logic and reason (facts!) were all you needed to inform
    decision making. However, this book opened my eyes to why storytelling is such
    an essential form of persuasion.'

    After all the hard work it takes to find a key insight, you must then communicate
    it effectively so that other people (decision makers) can understand it and be
    compelled to act on it. Too often, data professionals excel in the exploratory
    phase but then fail in the explanatory phase. As a result, their insights go nowhere.
    Mastering the art of data storytelling can ensure you succeed in this critical
    last mile.'

- en: '**BD:** I think we can all safely say “big data” was always just “data.” Sure,
    the term might have represented a significant shift in the volume of data that
    companies deal with, but to me, the “bigness” emphasis detracted from its more
    challenging aspects (variety, velocity, veracity, and value). I’ve also never
    been a fan of the term “citizen data scientist”. This term mischaracterizes the
    capacity for business users to become “pseudo” data scientists.'
