- en: Building machine learning solutions at scale remains an active area of experimentation
    for most organizations. While many companies are starting their initial machine
    learning pilots, few have a robust strategy to scale machine learning workflows.
    This issue is particularly challenging if we consider that, in the current market,
    machine learning research and development frameworks have evolved disproportionately
    faster than the corresponding infrastructure runtimes required to scale machine
    learning programs. With so little guidance available about how to build machine
    learning solutions at scale, an invaluable source becomes the experience of internet
    giants such as Uber, LinkedIn, Google, Netflix or Microsoft whose scalability
    requirements are exceedingly more complex than the ones faced by most companies.
    At LinkedIn, the roadblocks for delivering machine learning solutions at scale
    were becoming so critical that the company decided to create a separate initiative
    called Productive Machine Learning(Pro-ML) to address this challenge.

- en: 'A machine learning solution typically goes through a series of stages from
    model training to deployment. While structuring that lifecycle in machine learning
    solutions with a handful of models and small teams is relatively trivial but scaling
    it across dozens of data science teams and thousands of machine learning models
    is nothing short of a nightmare. In an organization like LinkedIn, machine learning
    are vulnerable to many well-known scaling challenges:'

- en: Data exploration and model authoring are essential aspects of the lifecycle
    of machine learning solution. As a data science organization grows, they face
    the challenge of different teams adopting different approaches for data exploration
    and relying on different frameworks for creating models. This wouldn’t be a problem
    except for the fact that data exploration infrastructures tend to be one of the
    most computationally expensive components of machine learning workflows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To enable a consistent data exploration and model authoring experience, Pro-ML
    relied on a domain-specific-language(DSL) that abstracts the key representations
    of a machine learning model such as input features, transformation, algorithms,
    outputs and several others. Additionally, Pro-ML provides Jupyter Notebooks that
    hat allows step-by-step exploration of the data, selection of features, and drafting
    the DSL. The Pro-ML team also provided bindings to integrate their machine learning
    DSL with popular IDEs such as IntelliJ.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Providing an interoperable mechanism for representing machine learning models
    is a clever mechanism to ensure consistency across diverse data science stacks.
    Looking at the Pro-ML DSL, I wonder if something such as the [Open Neural Network
    Exchange Format(ONNX)](https://onnx.ai/) is a more natural fit but the approach
    makes sense nonetheless.

- en: Complementing the previous point, one of the key roles of data exploration processes
    in machine learning workflows is to identify the key features of the target datasets.
    At the scale of an organization like LinkedIn, machine learning solutions need
    to deal with tens of thousands of features that need to be produced, discovered,
    consumed, and monitored. To address this challenge, Pro-ML built a central catalog
    for model features called Frame.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of Pro-ML’s Frame is to capture the metadata related to features of
    datasets both online and offline. Frame captures the data in a centralized database
    which is connected to Pro-ML’s model repository. Additionally, Frame provides
    a UI that allows data scientists to search for features based on various facets
    including the type of feature (numeric, categorical), statistical summary, and
    current usage in the overall ecosystem.

    can be divided into two main groups: real time(online) and batch(offline). Machine
    learning models that are time-sensitive require regular training using near real
    time datasets. Other models are better off being trained in batches on larger
    time cycles like daily or weekly.'

    models. The infrastructure includes a training service that supports different
    model types as well as tools for capabilities such as hyperparameter tuning. Pro-ML’s
    training runtime relies on Hadoop for offline training and also leverages technologies
    such as [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/)and [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) to
    execute training workflows.

    learning solutions. Effective model deployment typically requires to structure
    and package the different model artifacts in portable formats that can be executed
    across the infrastructure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pro-ML includes a deployment service that identifies the different artifacts
    of a machine learning models such as features, libraries or code dependencies
    and store them in a centralized repository for automatic validation. The deployment
    service enables capabilities such as orchestration, monitoring, and notification
    to ensure that the desired code and data artifacts are correctly deployed and
    working.

    workflows. Differently from traditional software applications, the performance
    of machine learning models can require different infrastructure configurations
    during its lifecycle and its performance can vary substantially depending on several
    aspects.

- en: The current version of Pro-ML includes a model execution engine called Quasar
    that is responsible for executing machine learning models defined in the proprietary
    DSL discussed previously. Quasar integrates with the feature marketplace to regularly
    evaluate the performance of models and it leverages mainstream serving frameworks
    such as [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/) or [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to
    enable federated execution models.

    a health assurance layer that enable the testing and monitoring of machine learning
    workflows. The health assurance layer regularly validates that the performance
    of a deployed model is in-line with the behavior exhibited during training and,
    in the case that anomalies are detected, it provides tools to diagnose the source
    of the issue. Pro-ML’s health assurance layer includes tools for data replaying,
    bug diagnose or model retraining which help to ensure the correct behavior of
    machine learning models.
