- en: As a beginner in the data science industry, you must have read countless articles
    describing the importance of creating data science projects. In fact, I [landed
    my first data science role](https://towardsdatascience.com/18-months-into-my-data-science-journey-dfd2fa2c8dc9)
    due to the projects I showcased on my portfolio.

  prefs: []

- en: I have reviewed resumes of data science applicants in the past, most of whom
    were rejected from entry-level positions without even making it to the interview
    phase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of these candidates did include projects on their resume — but the projects
    they showcased were too simple. These were projects they created at a bootcamp
    or online course, and did more harm than good to their application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recruiters skim through more than a hundred resumes for the same job position.
    If every candidate showcases a Titanic survival prediction model in the project
    section of their application, there is nothing that differentiates them from each
    other.

    unique and creative.

- en: Hiring managers know that it isn’t possible for you to master the entire machine
    learning tool-stack when applying for an entry-level role. That’s not what they
    are looking for. Skill can be honed over time, and there are a lot of things you
    can learn on the job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All you need to do is go one step further than other applicants. Showcase a
    creative project and tell a story around it. This shows that you are passionate
    about learning — that you would spend hours creating something not because you
    are getting any immediate gain out of it, but simply because you enjoy doing it.
    This willingness to learn is a trait most good managers and recruiters actively
    search for, since every other skill can be honed over time.

    ideas that would look great on your resume.

    you with links to them if available. I hope you can take inspiration from some
    of these projects, and perhaps even come up with your own version of them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was a project I created last year. I created a web application that allows
    the user to upload a picture of themselves or another person, and the underlying
    machine learning model would predict their celebrity lookalike.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I used this celebrity database to build the model. I used Flask in the back-end,
    and Javascript and HTML for the front-end of the application. VGG16 — a popular
    pre-trained neural network was used for model training.

- en: This is another project I created some time back. I built a text prediction
    model that would predict a user’s Harry Potter personality twin based on a sentence
    they entered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I used the MBTI personality prediction dataset for this task, and also mapped
    each Harry Potter character to their respective MBTI types based on the information
    I got from a Google Search.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Highly accurate? Probably not. Nevertheless, the model was fun to create.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To perform this task, I experimented with an LSTM model (this is a recurrent
    neural network architecture commonly used to predict a sequence, such as text
    data). I also tried using a pre-trained model that was built into the FastAI library,
    and trained it again using the MBTI dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, I created a web application for users to enter a sentence, and the
    output prediction would be rendered on the screen. This interface was created
    using a package called JupyterDash.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a project idea that has applications in many real-world scenarios. Often,
    underaged users or predators attempt to conceal their age on friendship or dating
    platforms. Many of these applications aren’t moderated very well and a lot of
    these profiles end up going undetected, leading to unfortunate circumstances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A highly accurate model that can attract a user’s age based on their profile
    picture can help filter out and restrict age-inappropriate users.

    conversation for hours until you realize you have absolutely nothing in common
    with them?
  prefs: []

    to machine learning, you can start with a simple correlation based solution.
  prefs: []

    with basic demographic and interest details. You can then create a correlation
    matrix to score the similarity between each user’s answers, and provide recommendations
    accordingly.

    built with pre-trained models and modules available in packages like OpenCV.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main thing that separates these projects from the ones I regularly see on
    candidate’s resumes is creativity. These projects are different. They attempt
    to solve a problem that is frequently encountered in the real world, or they’re
    fun to play around with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think along these lines when building a data science project for your resume.
    Create an interface that users can interact with. Work on your data presentation
    and storytelling skills, and don’t just let these projects sit in your GitHub
    repository.
