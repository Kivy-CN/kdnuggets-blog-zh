- en: scikit-feature is an open-source feature selection repository in Python developed
    at Arizona State University. It is built upon one widely used machine learning
    package scikit-learn and two scientific computing packages Numpy and Scipy. scikit-feature
    contains around 40 popular feature selection algorithms, including traditional
    feature selection algorithms and some structural and streaming feature selection
    algorithms.

- en: It serves as a platform for facilitating feature selection application, research
    and comparative study. It is designed to share widely used feature selection algorithms
    developed in the feature selection research, and offer convenience for researchers
    and practitioners to perform empirical evaluation in developing new feature selection
    algorithms.
