    deal with new situations that are ”related to” this experience. The inductive
    leap needed to deal with new situations seems to be possible only under certain
    biases for choosing one generalization of the situation over another. This paper
    defines precisely the notion of bias in generalization problems, then shows that
    biases are necessary for the inductive leap.

    harm our model. Bias control needs to be in the hands of someone who can differentiate
    between the right kind and wrong kind of bias.

    domain. In a program that learns the rules of baseball (Soloway & Riseman 1978),
    general knowledge about competitive games constrains the number of generalizations
    considered. This kind of prior knowledge can provide a strong, justifiable constraint
    on the generalizations considered. In such a case, the goal of the generalization
    system becomes ”determine generalizations consistent with the training instances,
    and with other known facts about the task domain”.

- en: Knowledge of the intended use of learned generalizations can provide a strong
    bias for learning. As a simple example, if the intended use of the learned generalizations
    involves a much higher cost for incorrect positive than for incorrect negative
    classifications, then the learning program should prefer more specific generalizations
    over more general alternatives that are consistent with the same training data.

    constraint on learning. For instance, in learning from a human teacher, we seem
    to take advantage of many assumptions about the existence of an organized curriculum
    to constrain our search for appropriate generalizations. In an organized curriculum,
    our attention is carefully focused on particular features of instances, in a way

- en: If a system is learning a collection of related concepts, or generalizations,
    then a possible constraint on generalizing any one of them is to consider successful
    generalization of others. For example, consider a task of learning structural
    descriptions of blocks-world objects, such as ”arch”, ”tower”, etc. After learning
    several concepts, the learned descriptions may reveal that certain features are
    more significant for describing this class of concepts than are others. For example,
    if the generalization language contained features such as ”shape”, ”color”, and
    ”age” of each block in the structure, the system may notice that ”age” is rarely
    a relevant feature

    features. The justification for this learned bias must be based upon some presumed

    how to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary biases that are in our models.
    Certainly we have to eliminate biases that would be a hindrance but as we practice
    and dig deep into the data, we may realize that some biases actually improve our
    model to what we actually want.
