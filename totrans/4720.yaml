- en: Let's face it. The only way to learn computer programming is to do it. Whether
    you want to skill up for your next job interview or just get a few pet projects
    done, programming can be an amazing tool. Python is an especially great tool for
    beginners, and it’s also a language that grows with you. You can use Python for
    everything from web development to data science by taking advantage of its huge
    array of frameworks and toolkits. Know the basics of Python, and you can go (nearly)
    anywhere in the programming world!
