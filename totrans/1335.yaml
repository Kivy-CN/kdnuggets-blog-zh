- en: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought numerous impacts to our routine. One of the
    most important factors organizations are discussing is the acceleration of Digital
    Transformation and its impact when it comes to data and technology. As noted by
    [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/04/11/the-changes-covid-19-is-forcing-on-to-business),
    one of the most obvious consequences of the pandemic will be “the infusion of
    data-enabled services into ever more aspects of life.” Which brings together another
    problem, the huge amount of data and how to get valuable consumer insights into
    that. Everybody knows how important is understanding your customer, but again,
    how to do that in an era of Information Overload?

- en: Information overload, a term coined by Debra Brass (former global president
    of J&J) in 2013, describes a reality in which the excessive availability of data
    makes its analysis so complex that, at a certain point, it becomes dysfunctional
    and stops to contribute to insightful analyses. It prevents companies from effective
    decision making because they can’t take action in face of so much data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This problematic context is likely a result of the rapid evolution in a company's
    ability to collect data, which is not followed by an evolution in the ability
    to integrate and analyze that data correctly. While the problem may affect companies
    as a whole, it is especially problematic for customer-facing teams such as Marketing,
    Customer Service, Sales, and Consumer Insights.

    estimate thatup to 80% of a Marketing or Consumer Insights executive''s time is
    spent trying to analyze consumer data. Among these executives, only 1 out of 5
    believe they have the right tools for the job. The exponential increase in the
    number of customer reviews in e-commerce platforms is a good example. Consumers
    are not only writing more reviews but also asking and answering more questions
    online, generating challenging amounts of data to analyze.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is as much of an opportunity as it is a problem: with more consumer reviews
    and conversations, companies have the chance to get access to that data and learn,
    in a very unbiased way, about their consumers, in real-time and faster than ever.
    But how can they explore a new source of consumer information when they are still
    struggling with data overload, and are not getting the insights they are looking
    for?'

    This concept, coined by Greylock Partners (one of the most relevant investment
    funds in the software industry), is for many seen as the next big wave of innovation
    in the world of data analytics. Systems of Intelligence appear as an additional
    layer that connects Systems of Record - platforms on which the data is stored,
    such as a CRM or ERP platform - and Systems of Engagement - platforms on which
    interactions occur to capture that data (such as a Customer Service or messaging
    tools).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main value proposition of Systems of Intelligence is to connect different
    data from different sources - that in most cases are underutilized because companies
    can’t even access them - to make it possible to generate deep insights from these
    data. By implementing these systems of intelligence, companies can not only reduce
    their work of connecting their own data with spreadsheets but can also add new
    sources of data into their analyses in a much easier way, with less technical
    challenges and a streamlined workflow, improving their quality in every operational
    cycle.

    to be missing. We all have access to data, but in most cases, we don’t know for
    sure what to look for: we analyze the wrong data, looking only at a part of the
    collected content without seeing the correlation of this with the rest, and we
    even chose the wrong metrics to measure it. More than that, we spend more time
    trying to understand the past than planning the future.'

    of time focusing our energy on actions that are not relevant to our success. According
    to a [Gartner's Study](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/why-gartner-expects-cmos-to-cut-marketing-analytics-units-in-half/546014/),
    60% of the areas of Data Intelligence and Consumer Insights will be cut by half
    by the year 2023 simply because they are unable to generate value from the captured
    data.
