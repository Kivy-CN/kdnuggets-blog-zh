- en: Data science and analytics are progressing faster than ever before – and many
    predictions indicate that these fields will not slow down anytime soon. It makes
    a lot of sense, looking at their integration into the current business environment.
    But it goes beyond that. These fields are among the main driving forces in many
    important sectors right now, including ones where profit is not the main motivation.

- en: There is a lot of space for implementing advanced analytical solutions in a
    wide range of industries, from healthcare to logistics. In many regards, we’re
    barely scratching the surface of what’s possible, and it will be exciting to see
    where the future takes us. Until then, let’s have a look at some of the key trends
    on the horizon right now.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science has been heavily involved in fraud – unfortunately, on both sides
    of it. On the one hand, we have malicious actors aided by technology that allows
    them to effortlessly spoof communication from other parties, including producing
    fake voice recordings and videos. While most have been focused on the entertainment
    implications of this technology, various sectors like finance have been facing
    significant issues as a result of these trends. Video is quickly becoming unreliable
    as a form of identity verification, and companies have been scrambling to find
    alternatives that don’t raise any red flags in privacy-conscious users’ minds.

- en: On the other hand, advanced analytical systems are at [the forefront of combating
    scammers](https://www.henryharvin.com/blog/usage-of-data-science-in-fraud-detection/)
    right now. Many classic scams can be reliably identified almost completely automatically,
    relieving human operators of a huge portion of their work, and leaving them to
    focus on cases that actually require manual intervention.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the beginning, while data science was still gaining momentum, the technological
    forefront of the field was a huge mess. Researchers were trying to use pretty
    much every language and tech stack under the sun to figure out what works and
    what doesn’t, and it was difficult for newcomers to orient themselves in a direction
    that didn’t face the risk of obsoletion. Now, it’s a different story. Several
    languages like R and Python have [emerged as industry leaders](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/data-science-programming-languages/),
    and we’re already seeing some full stacks stabilizing on the market and enjoying
    attention from companies at all levels.

    because it provides them with much more security and confidence during their learning
    stage, which is arguably when people need that kind of support the most.

- en: 3\. Lower Technological Barrier of Entry
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data analytics used to be seen as something exclusive to companies that could
    afford the expensive specialists to handle those systems. Not anymore. Advanced
    analytical solutions are now increasingly being packaged into user-friendly ways,
    aimed at people with absolutely no experience in the field. That, in general,
    is not a new trend in the tech industry. Just look at application development
    – several decades ago, it required expensive, highly qualified specialists to
    just get some basic groundwork done. Today, those specialists are still needed,
    but in much more tightly defined positions. Scientists are still working on pushing
    programming paradigms further. But the rest of the work is handled by people with
    less experience, using technologies that have seen years of polishing to make
    them usable by the average person.

- en: The same is already happening with data science and analytics. And it will likely
    continue to happen over the next few years, possibly even through the whole decade.
    Which is great news for everyone involved – companies will find it easier to get
    access to in-depth analytics, while specialists will enjoy the freedom of working
    on more challenging projects instead of constantly being tasked with menial work.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that leads us to another important point. As these changes are taking over,
    the job market has started to shift in some predictable ways. While companies
    don’t need advanced specialists to handle their analytics anymore (at least on
    a basic level), demand for the most qualified professionals in that field has
    been climbing steadily. That’s because companies with deep pockets want to be
    at the front of new developments in the field, and that still requires significant
    investments and a competent workforce.

    a lot of potential ahead of them. And there’s no indication that things will move
    in a different direction anytime soon.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last decade saw an explosion in gathering data and storing it for future
    analysis. One of the benefits of advanced data analytics is that it can work just
    as well on historic data, which has prompted some borderline hoarding behavior
    in some of the biggest companies on the market – the ones that can afford the
    large data centers needed to store all of that information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But recently, a new trend has started to emerge. Companies have started to realize
    that a lot of the data they’ve been piling up for later analysis could actually
    end up largely useless, at least in its current state. Data collection practices
    weren’t exactly diligent and streamlined in the beginning, meaning that many companies
    are now in possession of huge sets that need a lot of sanitization work. Unfortunately,
    that’s still something that requires manual labor to a huge extent – and that’s
    [where a lot of the attention is going to fall](https://expressanalytics.com/blog/growing-importance-of-data-cleaning/)
    over the next decade.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, data science is moving towards a much more streamlined situation,
    one where everyone has a specific place in the industry and where typical requirements
    for a project are known in advance. That doesn’t mean that there will be any less
    opportunity for competent specialists to thrive though – quite the contrary. Now
    is the best time for those who want to be involved in that field as closely as
    possible.
