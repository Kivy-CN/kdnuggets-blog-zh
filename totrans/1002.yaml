    optimization algorithm, namely, the Gradient Descent Approximation (GDA) and we’ll

    the gradient descent algorithm will always find the minimum. How many optimization
    steps it’s going to take to get to *X_min* depends on how good the initial guess
    is. Sometimes if the initial guess or the learning rate is not carefully chosen,
    the algorithm can completely miss the minimum. This is often referred to as an
    “**overshoot**”. Generally, one could ensure convergence by adding a convergence
