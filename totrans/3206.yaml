    **supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, and **reinforcement learning**.
    In this tutorial, taken from the brand new edition of [Python Machine Learning](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition?utm_source=kdnuggets&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pml2e),
    we’ll take a closer look at what they are and the best types of problems each
    one can solve.'

- en: The main goal in supervised learning is to learn a model from labeled training
    data that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data. Here, the
    term **supervised** refers to a set of samples where the desired output signals
    (labels) are already known.

    a supervised machine learning algorithm on a corpus of labeled emails, emails
    that are correctly marked as spam or not-spam, to predict whether a new email
    belongs to either of the two categories. A supervised learning task with discrete
    class labels, such as in the previous email spam filtering example, is also called
    a **classification task**. Another subcategory of supervised learning is **regression**,
    where the outcome signal is a continuous value:'

    predict the categorical class labels of new instances, based on past observations.
    Those class labels are discrete, unordered values that can be understood as the
    group memberships of the instances. The previously mentioned example of email
    spam detection represents a typical example of a binary classification task, where
    the machine learning algorithm learns a set of rules in order to distinguish between
    two possible classes: spam and non-spam emails.'

- en: However, the set of class labels does not have to be of a binary nature. The
    predictive model learned by a supervised learning algorithm can assign any class
    label that was presented in the training dataset to a new, unlabeled instance.
    A typical example of a **multiclass classification** task is handwritten character
    recognition. Here, we could collect a training dataset that consists of multiple
    handwritten examples of each letter in the alphabet. Now, if a user provides a
    new handwritten character via an input device, our predictive model will be able
    to predict the correct letter in the alphabet with certain accuracy. However,
    our machine learning system would be unable to correctly recognize any of the
    digits zero to nine, for example, if they were not part of our training dataset.

    given 30 training samples; 15 training samples are labeled as negative class (minus
    signs) and 15 training samples are labeled as positive class (plus signs). In
    this scenario, our dataset is two-dimensional, which means that each sample has
    two values associated with it: X[1] and X[2]'

    decision boundary represented as a dashed line—that can separate those two classes
    and classify new data into each of those two categories given its X1 and X2 values:'

- en: Classification allows us to assign categorical, unordered labels to instances.
    A second type of supervised learning is the prediction of continuous outcomes,
    which is also called regression analysis. In regression analysis, we are given
    a number of predictor (explanatory) variables and a continuous response variable
    (outcome or target), and we try to find a relationship between those variables
    that allows us to predict an outcome.

    scores of our students. If there is a relationship between the time spent studying
    for the test and the final scores, we could use it as training data to learn a
    model that uses the study time to predict the test scores of future students who
    are planning to take this test.

    predictor variable x and a response variable y, we fit a straight line to this
    data that minimizes the distance—most commonly the average squared distance—between
    the sample points and the fitted line. We can now use the intercept and slope
    learned from this data to predict the outcome variable of new data:'
