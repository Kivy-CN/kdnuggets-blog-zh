- en: With the ever-increasing volume of electronic data in today’s organizations,
    end users lack the time to practice intelligent information governance. It has
    become a universal truth that the gargantuan amount of corporate data has far
    exceeded human ability to effectively manually manage it.

- en: Fortunately, in the not-too-distant future lies the possibility of [Predictive
    Information Governance](https://blog.archive360.com/are-pigs-starting-to-fly)
    (PIG). I consider this automated information governance—which is based on unsupervised
    machine learning technology—to be the holy grail for information management. Ideally,
    it results in intelligent, near error-free automation that keeps end users from
    having to make decisions that, due to information overload, they are no longer
    qualified to make, such as whether or not to retain documents, how long to keep
    them, and where to safely store them.

    themselves,” and it is the key to truly automating not only records management
    and document recognition/categorization, but the whole enchilada of information
    governance. By taking the error-prone human factor out of the equation,PIG not
    only allows the system to store, categorize, apply retention/disposition, and
    manage content *automatically* as it flows within the system, but it also revamps
    the learning process by removing the iterative manual training cycles.

- en: I believe that the reliance on end users is the weakest link in most intelligent
    automation and supervised machine learning technology platforms. Moving from supervised
    to unsupervised machine learning can help companies realize 100% automated predictive
    information governance. Yet when we think about predictive intelligence that can
    relieve people from having to anticipate and make content-related decisions, it
    can conjure up images of the main antagonist in “The Terminator” movies, Skynet,
    the malevolent conscious artificial intelligence.

    Skynet designers made a tactical error by failing to include Isaac Asimov’s famous
    [Three Laws of Robotics](https://www.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html). Here
    is an exact transcription of those laws:'
