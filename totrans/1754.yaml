- en: Talent acquisition may sound a minuscule term to most of us who have never been
    on the other side of the table. But in reality, the entire process of hiring is
    way too time-consuming, expensive and employs a number of resources. Hiring managers
    are responsible for all the hiring processes taking place in an organization.
    They have to devise such plans that attract a large number of eligible candidates
    while creating an environment where candidates would prefer to stay.

- en: '**Eligible Candidates:** Hiring managers have the responsibility to find out
    the best fit for a particular position. On an average, there are around 250 resumes
    received for a single corporate position. If the job is posted through an online
    job portal then these figures scale up to around 4,27,000 resumes. These figures
    are just not mind-boggling but filtering candidates manually or through some filtering
    algorithm is another uphill task.'

    the market candidates have become quite selective. They have various opportunities
    and they can easily reject a job offer if they find something more feasible and
    exciting elsewhere. Hiring managers have to jot down plans and create such marketing
    strategies that make the candidate stay. If a selected candidate drops off then
    again have to repeat the complete process and find a new replacement.'

    job requirements are not clearly communicated to the hiring managers. According
    to a survey conducted by ICIMS, 80% of recruiters think they have very good understanding
    of their job position while 61% of hiring managers believe that recruiters have
    moderate levels of understanding. This imbalance between both the parties is quite
    strenuous and creates a barrier for a smooth workflow.'

    according to the needs and requirements. As [stated by Mike Loukides](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-data-science),
    VP, O’Reilly Media "Data scientists are involved with gathering data, massaging
    it into a tractable form, making it tell its story, and presenting that story
    to others."

    that can be used to gain an insight into the candidate’s profile. The data is
    aggregated from various resources especially social media channels where candidate
    thoughts are left as a digital imprint and this discrete information can be analyzed
    and transformed into facts through various powerful algorithms.

    business goals more effectively and also cut down their total hiring costs. 27%
    employers said that a bad hiring cost them around $50000 in a year. But through
    data science and analytics, this cost can be reduced significantly while providing
    best candidates for a position.
