- en: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are frequently used terms
    these days. AI refers to the concept of machines mimicking human cognition. ML
    is an approach used to create AI. If AI is when a computer can carry out a set
    of tasks based on instruction, ML is a machine’s ability to ingest, parse, and
    learn from that data itself in order to become more accurate or precise about
    accomplishing that task.

    retail, and tech may already have a basic understanding of ML and AI. However,
    not everyone is an expert in developing a training data strategy, a necessary
    first step for realizing a high return on machine learning investments.

    the better they’ll learn. Insufficient or low-quality training data can result
    in unreliable systems that reach the wrong conclusions, makes poor decisions,
    can’t handle real-world variation, and introduce or perpetuate bias, among other
    problems. Poor data is also expensive. [IBM estimated](https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-data-costs-the-u-s-3-trillion-per-year)
    that poor data quality in the United States costs the country’s economy roughly
    $3.1 trillion per year.

    need to train, test, and tune AI systems, you run the risk of delayed projects,
    not being able to scale appropriately, and competitors outpacing you. Below are
    six tips for building a successful training data strategy.

- en: When launching a new machine learning project, the first thing to [define is
    the objective you’re trying to achieve](https://www.gartner.com/binaries/content/assets/events/keywords/catalyst/catus8/preparing_and_architecting_for_machine_learning.pdf).
    That will tell you what type of data you need and how many “training items” —
    data points that have been categorized — you’ll need to train your system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, training items for a computer vision or pattern recognition project
    would be image data that has been labeled by human annotators to identify the
    contents (trees, stop signs, people, cars, etc.) of the image. Furthermore, depending
    on what kind of solution you’re building, your model may need to be continuously
    retrained or refreshed. Your solution might require quarterly, monthly, or even
    weekly updates.

    evaluate your options for sourcing data, and calculate a budget.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to be clear-eyed about the time and money investment required
    to get the initiative off the ground, maintain it over time, and evolve the features
    and functionality — along with your business — so the solution stays relevant
    and useful to your customers. Starting a machine learning program is a long-term
    investment. Getting a great return requires a long-term strategy.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The type of data you’ll need depends on the kind of solution you’re building.
    Some data sourcing options include real-world usage data, survey data, public
    datasets, and synthetic data. For example, a speech recognition solution that
    understands spoken human commands must be trained on high-quality speech data
    (real-world data) that has been translated into text. A search solution needs
    text data annotated by human judges to tell it which results are the most relevant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common types of data used in machine learning are image, video, speech,
    audio, and text. Before they’re used for machine learning, training data items
    must be annotated or labeled, to identify what they are. Annotation tells a model
    what to do with each piece of data. For example, if a data item for a virtual
    home assistant is the recording of someone saying “Order more double-A batteries,”
    the annotation might tell the system to start an order with a particular online
    retailer when it hears “order,” and to search on “AA batteries” when it hears
    “double-A batteries.”

- en: Depending on the task, data annotation can be a relatively simple activity —
    but it’s also repetitive, time-consuming, and difficult to do right consistently.
    It requires a human touch.
  prefs: []

- en: The stakes are high because if you train a model on inaccurate data, the model
    will do the wrong thing. For example, if you train a computer vision system for
    autonomous vehicles with images of sidewalks mislabeled as streets, the results
    could be disastrous. Indeed, “[poor data quality is enemy number one to the widespread,
    profitable use of machine learning](https://hbr.org/2018/04/if-your-data-is-bad-your-machine-learning-tools-are-useless).”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we talk about quality here, we’re talking about both the accuracy and consistency
    of those labels. Accuracy is how close a label is to the truth. Consistency is
    the degree to which multiple annotations on various training items agree with
    one another.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Emphasizing data quality helps companies mitigate bias in their AI projects,
    which can be hidden until your AI-based solution reaches the market. At that point,
    the bias can be difficult to fix.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bias generally comes from blind spots or unconscious preferences in the project
    team or training data, from the outset of a project. Bias in AI can manifest as
    uneven voice or facial recognition performance for different genders, accents,
    or ethnicities. As AI becomes more prevalent in our culture, now is the time to
    address built-in bias.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To avoid bias at the project level, actively build diversity into the teams
    defining your goals, roadmaps, metrics, and algorithms. Hiring a diverse team
    of data talent is easier said than done, but the stakes are high. If the internal
    makeup of your team doesn’t represent the external makeup of potential customers,
    then the end product risks only working for, or appealing to, a subset of people,
    and missing a mass-market opportunity or worse: bias might lead to real-world
    discrimination.'

- en: Not every data project uses personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive
    data. For solutions that do leverage that type of information, data security is
    more important than ever, especially when you’re working with the PII of your
    customers, financial or government records, or user-generated content. Increasingly,
    government regulations are dictating how companies must handle customer information.
  prefs: []

- en: Securing this confidential data protects your—and your customers’—information.
    Being transparent and ethical about your practices and sticking to your terms
    of service gives you a competitive advantage. Not doing so puts you at risk of
    scandal and negative impacts on your brand.

    Most organizations need large volumes of high-quality training data, fast and
    at scale. To achieve this, they must build a data pipeline that delivers sufficient
    volume at the speed needed to refresh their models. That’s why choosing the right
    data annotation technology is crucial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tool(s) you select must be able to handle the appropriate data types for
    your initiative, allow for flexible labeling workflow designs, manage individual
    annotator quality and throughput, and provide machine learning-assisted data labeling
    to augment human annotators’ performance.

    revealed that 87% of organizations are adopting at least one form of transformative
    technology like AI, but only 26% believe that appropriate business models are
    in place to capture full value from these technologies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating a solid training data strategy is the first step toward capturing the
    value of AI. That includes setting your budget, identifying your data sources,
    ensuring quality, and building in security. A clear data strategy can also help
    provide the steady pipeline of data that most machine learning models need for
    regular refreshes. A training data strategy alone won’t guarantee AI success,
    but it can help ensure companies are better positioned to leverage the benefits
    that AI offers.
