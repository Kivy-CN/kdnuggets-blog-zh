    then hire more people to maintain them. Also, you will be responsible for security
    and any service outage.

- en: Instead of using one tool for each step in the MLOps pipeline, you can use only
    one to do them all. With just one end-to-end MLOPs tool, you can train, track,
    store, version, deploy, and monitor machine learning models. All you have to do
    is deploy them locally using Docker or on the Cloud.
  prefs: []

- en: Using open-source tools is suitable for having more control and privacy, but
    it comes with the challenges of managing them, updating them, and dealing with
    security issues and downtime. If you are starting as an MLOps engineer, I suggest
    you focus on open-source tools and then move to managed services like Databricks,
    AWS, Iguazio, etc.
