    Machine Learning. Well, it didn’t but you can use it for testing your personalized
    AutoML software. In this tutorial, we will show you how to build and containerize
    your own Automated Machine Learning software and test it on GitHub using Docker
    container.

    Python to develop a simple AutoML solution and deploy it as a Docker container
    using GitHub actions. If you haven’t heard about PyCaret before, you can read
    official announcement for PyCaret 2.0 [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/announcing-pycaret-2-0-39c11014540e) or

- en: Automated machine learning (AutoML) is a process of automating the time consuming,
    iterative tasks of machine learning. It allows data scientists and analysts to
    build machine learning models with efficiency while sustaining the model quality.
    The final goal of any AutoML software is to finalize the best model based on some
    performance criteria.

- en: Traditional machine learning model development process is resource-intensive,
    requiring significant domain knowledge and time to produce and compare dozens
    of models. With automated machine learning, you’ll accelerate the time it takes
    to develop production-ready ML models with great ease and efficiency.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many AutoML software out there, paid as well as open source. Almost
    all of them use the same collection of transformations and base algorithms. Hence
    the quality and performances of the models trained under such software are approximately
    the same.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Paid AutoML software as a service are very expensive and financially infeasible
    if you does not have dozens of use-cases in your back pocket. Managed machine
    learning as a service platforms are relatively less expensive, but they are often
    hard to use and require knowledge of the specific platform.

- en: Among many other open source AutoML libraries, PyCaret is relatively a new library
    and has a unique low-code approach to machine learning. The design and functionality
    of PyCaret is simple, human friendly, and intuitive. In short amount of time,
    PyCaret was adopted by over 100,000 data scientists globally and we are a growing
    community of developers.
