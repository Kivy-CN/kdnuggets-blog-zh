    can be used to help with everything from predicting supply and demand for clean
    energy systems to [identifying](https://www.widsconference.org/blog_archive/the-women-in-data-science-wids-datathon-2022-is-now-live-on-kaggle)
    which buildings to target for energy efficiency upgrades. As we use data science
    to develop innovative solutions to climate change, we should be careful not to
    replicate, or worsen, existing inequities - or create new ones.

    will hit harder in poor countries and communities least equipped to deal with
    the consequences. Unfortunately, many of the solutions we are developing are also
    inequitable. Poor households that still cook with coal and kerosene can’t afford
    solar roofs and energy-efficient appliances. Low-income parents juggling work
    and childcare have little time to spend at charging stations to charge electric
    vehicles and may not have a garage or driveway to charge them at home.

    that are both greener and more equitable. For example, many communities don’t
    have access to reliable public transportation. According to [Dr. Tierra Bills](https://www.widsconference.org/tierra-bills.html),
    Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UCLA, data on [transportation
    needs](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-76059-5_8) is often
    unavailable or inaccurate, especially for groups like the elderly or disabled
    who face access issues. New geolocation data sources and methods for collecting
    transit preferences directly from users can offer a more comprehensive picture
    of people’s transportation needs. Data science could help us optimize route planning
    and create on-demand bus routes and carpool matching services for underserved
    areas.

    to clean, reliable energy. A staggering 760 million people worldwide lack [electricity](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/06/07/report-universal-access-to-sustainable-energy-will-remain-elusive-without-addressing-inequalities)
    and many more experience frequent disruptions. According to energy expert [Dr.
    Xin Ma](https://www.widsconference.org/xinma.html), Managing Director of the Asia
    Platform at TotalEnergies Ventures, advances in data science can help us expand
    and democratize access to energy. For example, microgrids and mini grids can bring
    energy to remote and underserved communities by enabling small scale, localized
    electricity generation that is not dependent on the traditional power grid. Data
    science is used to forecast energy supply based on weather patterns and to monitor
    and optimize the condition of solar panels and batteries. In recent years, [microgrids
    and mini grids](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/06/07/report-universal-access-to-sustainable-energy-will-remain-elusive-without-addressing-inequalities)
    have brought power to more than 11 million people worldwide.

    show how the thoughtful use of data science can support equitable clean energy
    solutions. On March 7, the discussion will continue in a panel moderated by my
    colleague [Dr. Jenny Suckale](https://www.widsconference.org/jenny-suckale.html)
    at the [Women in Data Science Worldwide Conference](https://www.widsconference.org/)
    hosted at Stanford University and online. Here are some lessons inspired by these
    panels about how data scientists can help put equity into practice.

- en: '**1) Consider the many dimensions of equity.** In the past, efforts to promote
    equity often focused on giving people equal *access* to resources and opportunities.
    But equal access rarely leads to equitable *outcomes* when people start on uneven
    footing. [Equity](https://medium.com/paper-pinecone/teaching-the-difference-between-equality-equity-and-justice-in-preschool-paper-pinecone-3c6bbbd443ca)
    is a broader framework that looks in part at how benefits and burdens are distributed
    across different groups (race, income, gender, etc.) and geographies (rural vs.
    urban areas, Global North and South). It also takes people’s *agency* into account,
    asking questions like: Who is represented when decisions are made? What power,
    if any, do people have to change their situations and shape their communities?
    When looking at datasets with an equity lens, ask what is being measured, by whom,
    and for what purpose, as well as who is included in the data and who is not. It
    is also critical for marginalized groups to be represented in data science and
    data-driven decision making, so they play a role in decisions that will impact
    their communities.'

    to start any data science project with a clear articulation of your goals, rather
    than just gathering a bunch of data and throwing an algorithm at it. If you don’t
    understand the human impact of the problem you are trying to solve, you cannot
    develop equitable responses. For example, researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley
    National Laboratory were working with data on [rooftop solar installations](https://emp.lbl.gov/projects/solar).
    It was only by combining this dataset with demographic data that they were able
    to get insight into equity questions such as who is (and isn’t) installing solar
    on their homes, why or why not, and what barriers stand in the way of uptake among
    groups with less solar penetration.'

- en: '**3) Look out for “data deserts” and work to correct them.** If people aren’t
    represented in the data we have about a problem, they will be invisible when solutions
    are being designed. For example, if you’re developing supply and demand models
    for clean energy systems but don’t have data on the power needs of remote rural
    areas, the resulting system is unlikely to serve them well. There are useful technical
    approaches to address sparse or messy data, but we shouldn’t simply patch over
    data deserts using statistical techniques. Instead, we need to ensure data collection
    represents all relevant people and places. We need to think broadly about how
    we can get more, better data and push to open up data access across the private,
    research, and government sectors. This often requires carefully designed stakeholder
    and community engagement.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**4) Acknowledge the limits of existing data.** Data shows us what people do
    given existing resources and constraints, not what they ideally want or need or
    what they would do under different incentives. For example, areas with inconsistent
    access to power may have low energy usage not because there isn’t demand, but
    because people don’t install appliances or engage in activities that they might
    if they were guaranteed a consistent power supply. We shouldn’t assume that how
    people behave now is how they would prefer to act in a more equitable world.'

- en: '**5) Be careful not to smooth over inequities with big data.** While big data
    is all the rage these days, it isn’t the only scale we should be looking at. Equity
    problems are often local and in the weeds. These small signals can get washed
    out when they are just a blip in a massive dataset. For example, average travel
    times for commuters may mask the outliers whose only option to get to work is
    a two-hour, multi-stage journey. You can avoid smoothing over inequities by using
    techniques that disaggregate data and get as granular as possible. For example,
    agent-based models like the [BEAM model](https://transportation.lbl.gov/beam)
    for transportation planning allow you to look at people’s behaviors and preferences
    at an individual level.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**6) Find innovative ways to gather data on community needs.** Marginalized
    groups are often underrepresented in existing data sources. Look for creative
    ways to collect both quantitative and qualitative data about these communities
    - and to gather their input about the data collection and analysis process itself.
    New data-gathering tools like mobile apps and online surveys can help, but be
    cautious that tech-enabled tools don’t further overlook people with limited access.
    It’s essential to directly engage with marginalized groups, collaborating with
    key stakeholders and community members to understand their perspectives on what
    questions to ask, what data to collect, and what solutions to design.'

- en: These are just some of the ways we can use data science to help address climate
    change in a more equitable way. Right now, there’s a lot of “equity-washing” happening.
    Organizations claim to take equity into consideration but aren’t really doing
    much to challenge the status quo. Instead, equity needs to be front and center
    throughout the data science process, from gathering data and analyzing problems
    to designing and implementing solutions. This is how we can build a world that
    is both greener and more just.
