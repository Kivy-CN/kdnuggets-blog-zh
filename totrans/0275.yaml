- en: Are deep neural networks creative? It seems like a reasonable question. Google's
    ["Inceptionism"](https://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html)
    technique transforms images, iteratively modifying them to enhance the activation
    of specific neurons in a deep net. The images appear *trippy*, transforming rocks
    into buildings or leaves into insects. Another neural generative model, introduced
    by Leon Gatys of the University of Tubingen in Germany, [can extract the style
    from one image (say a painting by Van Gogh),](https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/01/art-algorithm-recreates-paintings)
    and apply it to the content of another image (say a photograph).

    are capable of synthesizing novel images by modeling the distribution of seen
    images. Additionally, character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) language
    models now permeate the internet, appearing to hallucinate [passages of Shakespeare](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/),
    Linux source code, and even [Donald Trump''s hateful Twitter ejaculations](https://twitter.com/deepdrumpf).
    Clearly, these advances emanate from interesting research and deserve the fascination
    they inspire.'

    or explain the methods (which has been done, ad nauseum), we'll instead address
    the question, can these nets reasonably be called "creative"?Already, some make
    the claim. The landing page for [deepart.io](deepart.io), a site which commercializes
    the "Deep Style" work, proclaims "TURN YOUR PHOTOS INTO ART". If we accept creativity
    as a prerequisite for art, the claim is made here implicitly.

    Aaron Souppouris described a character-based RNN, suggesting that higher sampling
    temperatures make the network "more creative". In this view, creativity is the
    opposite of coherence.

- en: Can we accept a view of creativity which consists primarily of stochasticity?
    Does it make any sense to accept a definition by which creativity is maximized
    by a random number generator? In this view, creativity reduces to entropy maximization.
    Interestingly, this seems opposite to views on creativity espoused by deep learning
    pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber, [who suggests that low entropy, in the form of short
    description length is a defining characteristic of art.](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/locoart/locoart.html)
    More importantly, it seems at odds with the notion of creativity we attribute
    to humans. It seems uncontroversial to label Charlie Parker, Beethoven, Dostoevsky,
    and Picasso, as creative, and yet they their work is clearly coherent. [![charlie-parker-001](../Images/b80a7b5409ff69e8e5a874f72b400ccd.png)](/wp-content/uploads/charlie-parker-001.jpg)

- en: 'The algorithms, to which we seem tempted to hastily ascribe creativity, tend
    to fall into two classes. First, there are deterministic processes like Inceptionism
    and Deep Style. Then there are stochastic models, like RNN language models and
    generative adversarial networks, which model the distribution underlying training
    data, providing a sampling mechanism for generating new images/text from the approximate
    distribution. *Note: Given random auto-encoder weights, Deep Style could be grouped
    in the category of stochastic generating mechanism. Similarly, Inceptionism could
    be made stochastic by randomly choosing the nodes to enhance.*'

- en: In the deterministic case, creativity enters the process in two places. First,
    the creators of Inceptionism and Deep Style are themselves exceptionally creative.
    These papers introduced new and captivating tools that did not previously exist.
    Secondly, the wielder of these tools can make creative decisions about what images
    to process and what settings of the model's parameters to use. But of course,
    just as a camera cannot truthfully be described as creative, these tools have
    no agency. While the capabilities are impressive, with respect to a creative process,
    these tools function as super-cool Photoshop filters but do not themselves express
    creativity.

    capacity of GANs and RNNs to generate images on their own, requiring only a random
    seed, captures our imaginations. Recent research papers and blog posts, including
    my own, tend to anthropomorphize these models, describing their generative process
    as an act of "hallucination". However, I'd argue that these models, while exciting
    and promising, do not meet a reasonable bar to be called "creative".

    some creative humans invented an airplane. Of course, in a world without airplanes,
    no amount of random sampling from the distribution of existing technologies could
    produce an airplane. Creativity, as we apply the term most superlatively, refers
    not to those individuals who produce unbiased samples imitating that which exists,
    but to those with a capacity for divergent thinking, producing ideas and art,
    that is simultaneously compelling and yet surprising. This work doesn't reflect
    the distribution of previous work, but actually shifts it. That is, following
    the invention of airplanes, the probability of observing one became substantially
    higher.

    example Bach, whose development of counterpoint altered musical composition, or
    Charlie Parker, whose improvisational language, termed bebop, altered instrumental
    improvisation across decades and musical styles. In contrast, artists and writers
    who convincingly imitate, might more accurately be described as masterful than
    as creative. The papers introducing GANS and Deep Style are themselves creative
    precisely because they opened new areas of research.

    of a creative machine. The human brain is itself a creative machine, and it would
    be absurd to suggest that creativity is a property of carbon that could not be
    reproduced in silicon.

- en: However, we should hesitate before attributing the human virtue of creativity
    to today's models. Deterministic image generators are fascinating, but exhibit
    no agency. Stochastic models that produce realistic output might possess something
    akin to mastery. But for AI to exhibit creativity, it must do more than imitate.
    Perhaps reinforcement learners, upon discovering novel strategies, do exhibit
    creativity. AlphaGo for example achieved superhuman performance at playing GO,
    [discovering strategies that diverged dramatically from those known to human players](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/03/15/what-alphagos-sly-move-says-about-machine-creativity/).
    This system might reasonably be called creative. Still, humans exhibit creativity
    not only in producing strategies, but also in the broader domain of inventing
    problems to solve. It seems inevitable that truly creative AI will come. And while
    we should consider the possibility seriously, we should be wary of premature proclamations
    and the temptation to anthropomorphize our algorithms.
