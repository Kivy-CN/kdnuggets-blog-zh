    plot hierarchical clustering, choose an interesting branch in a histogram and
    show where these data are in a PCA plot. Or do k-means clustering, plot its silhouette
    diagram, choose instances with low silhouette and reveal these outliers in the
    most informative scatter-plot. Interactive visualizations, where one can select
    a subset of the data for further exploration, was always a strong feature of Orange.
    In Orange 3, we focus on exploratory data analysis even more by making every visual
    display interactive.'

- en: '**6\. Numpy based data storage.** While Orange’s front-end for visual programming
    has not changed much, there are several major overhauls under the hood. We have
    replaced the custom data storage implementation (the old ExampleTable class) with
    a new one (Orange.data.Table) that stores the actual data in numpy arrays. The
    algorithms that work on the data are also no longer a part of the C library, but
    implemented using a combination of code in Cython and efficient numpy operations.'

- en: '**7\. Wrappers for scikit-learn algorithms.** Numpy-based data storage that
    replaced Orange’s own internal data format was only a part of a bigger vision:
    interoperability with now abundant external Python-based data science libraries.
    We love the suite of algorithms Orange offers, with quite some focus on symbolic
    learning, but are also happy to be able to integrate external libraries that provide
    well-tested implementations of powerful data mining algorithms. An example of
    such library is scikit-learn, from which we politely borrow multiple algorithms.
    If any of these is not included yet, Orange provides a set of classes that simplify
    the wrapping of scikit-learn methods. Wrapping tightens the gap between scikit-learn’s
    “know what you are doing” and Orange’s “no matter the data and formats, it just
    works” philosophies.'
