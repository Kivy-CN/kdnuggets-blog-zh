    by the rise in popularity of the cloud data warehouse/data lake/data lakehouse.
    With more data moving to the cloud, companies were faced with an architectural
    decision - store specific, structured data in an expensive data warehouse where
    you can run high speed analytics with very good price/performance, or use a data
    lake to store all data - structured and unstructured - at much lower cost but
    no built-in query or analytics mechanisms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 2022, we’ll see more AI and ML workloads migrating to the data lake/data
    lakehouse because of the emergence of the Open Data Lake Analytics stack - a stack
    purpose-built for cloud data warehouse workloads that includes an open source
    high-performance query engine (Presto) on the data lake for SQL analytics, open
    formats, and open cloud. The next phase of growth in the cloud will include the
    open data lake to augment the cloud data warehouse, more open source behind analytics
    & AI, and out-of-the-box cloud solutions to drive innovation, meaning data platform
    teams will spend less time spent on managing complex, distributed systems and
    more time focused on delivering business-driven innovation.

    turning to public data marketplaces, using two approaches. First, companies that
    use data catalogs to access, use, and understand the rich data within their organization,
    will recognize that joining enterprise data with third-party data sets unlocks
    even more value and productivity than ever before. In contrast, traditional companies
    will realize that proprietary internal data sets can be monetized and packaged

    and complexity, central data teams are forced to deal with a wide array of functional
    units and associated data consumers. This makes it difficult to understand the
    data requirements for all cross functional teams and offer the right set of data
    products to their consumers. Data mesh is a new decentralized data architecture
    approach for data analytics that aims to remove bottlenecks and take data decisions
    closer to those who understand the data.

    At a time when the world tried to return to a degree of normalcy, the need to
    work together and collaborate sooner – and do so without data silos standing in
    the way – became even clearer. In striving to improve the way we come together
    around data, networks, and processes, we’ll see the advent of “collaboration mining,”
    enabling decisions to be tracked. Businesses have also learned that if they want
    to become truly data-driven, they’ll have to figure out how to run the right queries
    in the right place. Lastly, the API economy has opened up entirely new ways for
    businesses to unite for joint initiatives while reducing the relevancy of buy-versus-build.
    Automation is a strongly emerging area that removes the need to code these integrations,
    and I expect the technology to have a lasting impact in 2022.
