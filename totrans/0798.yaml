- en: When it comes to increasing your knowledge and skill set, a lot of people think
    about seeing academia, research and other forms of core learning as the foundations
    of all forms of knowledge. Behind a lot of this knowledge is methodology and processes
    to get to the point of it becoming knowledge. But a question that keeps circulating
    in the academic community is ‘Does academia focus too much on methodology over
    insights?”.

- en: Before we get into it, let’s first define what ‘Methodology’ is. Methodology
    in an academic context refers to a system of approaches used to carry out research,
    using a variety of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Methodology is a key element when it comes to research. Research is used to
    support a statement or look further into a specific statement that does not have
    enough backing. Therefore when it comes to research, there needs to be a high
    degree of precision and reliability to it. Without precision and reliability,
    the research industry's reputation will lose credibility.

    we couldn’t have even imagined. Insight focuses on the discoveries that emerge
    from all the research, which have later been used to innovate, solve problems
    and create a different type of future for us ourselves.

    that insights have proven to be more useful than methodology?
  prefs: []

    for methodology.
  prefs: []

- en: It’s not a question of ‘what came first, the chicken or the egg?’. We know that
    methodologies and processes came first, the question now is does academia focus
    too much on methodology over insight?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Insights wouldn’t be here if we didn’t have rigorous systematic frameworks in
    place for research. These have played an integral role in the years of innovation
    the world has seen, however have these approaches caused people to focus on what’s
    right in front of them rather than seeing the bigger picture.

    success. You have parents pushing their children to be the best they can be, go
    to the best universities, and land amazing jobs. Yes, every parent wants their
    children to be successful, but don’t you think times have changed. There are less
    and less students wanting to pursue studying at universities, and more and more
    young millionaires. Something doesn’t seem to be adding up, right?

    have better access to the world, education, and resources to learn whatever they
    want. The one big thing they do have that was not so prominent in previous generations
    was being creative and unapologetically nurturing it.

    thinking side. This is what has led to breakthroughs, multi-million ideas and
    a whole paradigm shift. Is methodology killing open-mindedness? Or does academia
    need to adopt a more creative and interdisciplinary approach?

    to push the rigid process of methodologies can kill peoples creative spirit when
    it comes to academia. As we mentioned, groundbreaking discoveries have happened
    due to creative spirit, does it make sense to kill it?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both methodology insights are interdependent. Academia needs to be flexible
    and find the balance between embracing different values that insights can bring
    to the table, without completely taking methodology off the table. You can still
    have rigorous methods that do not negate or overshadow the potential of what insights
    can tell us.

    benefits, or the first telephone. We learnt to adapt to the times we are currently
    living in. Academia has seen a sharp drop in young people who want to continue
    higher education. This could be for various reasons, but one naturally is that
    the learning methods are ‘old school’. It does not resonate with the new generations,
    because they are living in a completely different time.

    they can do with that insight. Therefore, it is important for academia to shift
    in encouraging new creative approaches to research as well as ensuring to teach
    the importance of robust methodologies.

    with the baby boomers, Gen X and went to school with millennials. Change does
    not always have to be bad, and in this case I personally think change within academia
    will be highly beneficial for the next generations.

    is the only way to continuously drive progression within academia and innovation
    to create a better world.
