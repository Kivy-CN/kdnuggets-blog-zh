    job vacancies that require a bachelor's degree. This additional requirement for
    a degree has eliminated 64% of working-aged adults as they do not hold a degree,
    according to [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/emerging_degree_reset_020922.pdf).

    degrees, as an educated workforce tends to have a higher rate of productivity,
    as stated by the [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/publication/states-education-productivity-growth-foundations/).
    Narrowing the pool of applications by adding a bachelor's degree requirement is
    also an easy route for many companies.

    new opportunities that AI brings to the table. Rather than being able to find
    overly skilled employees they once upon a time wanted, companies are not looking
    for employees who are willing to reskill and upskill are crucial.

    due to the lack of a degree. When I decided to pursue a career in Data Science,
    I didn’t have the time or finances to commit to a 3-year degree. My time was precious
    as I had to make money therefore I opted for a Data Science bootcamp. This Bootcamp
    would take me 9 months and I would only have to pay a % back once I earned over
    a certain amount.

    would say neither is the wrong route. However, you need to look further into the
    future. Is this a short-term goal for your career or do you want to keep building
    your long-term career goal?

    summarized in a recent report: “Jobs do not require four-year degrees, Employers
    do.” However, with that being said, many employers have chosen to drop bachelor’s
    degree requirements to cater to the current market needs.'

    your foot into the sector and starting from the bottom. However, if you want to
    eventually advance in your career and move onto different positions, what do you
    need to obtain that? Understanding what you want now vs what you want later on
    is key to helping you make the right choice.

    want to dive in and do some research. For example, you may want to start as a
    junior data scientist and then eventually make your way up to a lead data scientist.
    But your goals may not end here, you may want to take it a little further and
    state that your end goal is to become a Chief Technology Officer (CTO).

    titles, from entry-level up to senior level. Dive into the education requirements,
    and the years of experience, as well as find other people on platforms such as
    LinkedIn to review their educational path.

    less in comparison to degrees. They focus on technical skill development over
    soft skills which help you progress in a workforce setting. Professional certificates
    can be a great route for you to experience your interest in a short time frame
    and ensure this is what you want to do. You can reskill without losing too much
    of your time, as you would with a bachelor's or master's degree.

    and come at a cost. However, they can be worth it. Not only will you develop technical
    skills, but you will also be able to build soft skills such as critical thinking
    and creativity. Hard and soft skills go hand-in-hand when you want to be successful
    in the workforce. It is also well known that degrees raise your salary and you
    face lower unemployment risks in comparison to employees who do not acquire higher
    education. Although entry-level vacancies are dropping the requirement for bachelor's
    degrees, to advance in your career you may require one.
