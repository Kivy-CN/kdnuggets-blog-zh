    and [TextMining with R](http://www.slideshare.net/whitish/textmining-with-r).
    In the first case, most of these comments were requests for the slides (the author
    chose to disable downloads) and in the second case, most of the comments were
    requests for code that was excerpted in the presentation. Similarly, because some
    presentations had downloads disabled, the average download count is misleading.
    Adjusting for these comments and some downloads being disabled, the real averages
    are approximately 994 downloads and 3 comments per presentation.'

    generally applicable lectures, like [Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques](http://www.slideshare.net/Tommy96/data-mining-concepts-and-techniques-4036310),
    might draw a larger general viewership, the viewers will be less likely to favorite
    the slides. On the other hand, a more specific slideshow like [Mining Social Data
    for Fun and Insight](http://www.slideshare.net/adunne/mining-social-data-for-fun-and-insight)
    might not draw as large of a general crowd, but the viewers may be more likely
