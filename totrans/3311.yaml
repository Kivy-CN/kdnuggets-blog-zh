    "Daddy''s Car" and "Mister Shadow”, created by scientists at SONY CSL Research
    Lab. The researchers have developed FlowMachines, a system that learns music styles
    from a huge database of songs. Exploiting unique combinations of style transfer,
    optimisation and interaction techniques, FlowMachines composes novel songs in
    many styles.   The two songs are excerpts of albums composed by Artificial Intelligence
    to be released in 2017.'
