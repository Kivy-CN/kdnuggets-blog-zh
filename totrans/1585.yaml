    better to find a problem that you are interested in and that will motivate you.
    While searching for a topic, you should definitely concentrate on your preferences
    and interests.

    complaining about? This can be another good source of ideas for a data science
    project. In those cases where people are still complaining about it, this may
    mean that the problem wasn’t solved properly the first time around. Thus, if you
    challenge it with data, you could provide an even better solution and have an
    impact in how this topic is perceived.

    Berlin for work. Most newcomers complained that they hadn’t imagined Berlin to
    be so expensive, and that there were no statistics about possible price ranges
    of the apartment. If they had known this it beforehand, they could have asked
    for a higher salary during the job application process or could have considered
    other options.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but could not find any plausible statistics or visualizations of the current market
    prices. And this was how I came up with the idea of this analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wanted to gather the data, build an interactive dashboard where you could
    select different options such as a 40m2 apartment situated in Berlin Mitte with
    a balcony and equipped kitchen, and it would show you the price ranges. This,
    alone, would help people understand apartment prices in Berlin. Also, by applying
    machine learning, I would be able to identify the drivers of the rental prices
    and practise with different machine learning algorithms.

    while saving data into a file, and one of the fields also contains commas, you
    can end up having files which are not separated very well.

    apartment after a month. I was told that if nobody wanted this apartment, the

    of 2.5 rooms falls into the distribution of 2 room apartment. The reason for this
    is that most of the 2.5 room apartments aren’t situated in the center of the city
    which, of course, reduces the price.
