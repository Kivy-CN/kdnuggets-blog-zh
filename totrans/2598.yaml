- en: Many top universities make some of their courses available for free to non-students,
    a trend which has been gradually increasing over the years. While perhaps not
    the first example of such an offering, we can thank Andrew Ng (among others, certainly)
    for making his Stanford Machine Learning course available beyond the classroom,
    first via third party means, and then as one of the first courses on the MOOC
    platform Coursera. Since then, courses offered both via such a platform as well
    as those with publicly-accessible course websites have rapidly increased in number.
    There are no shortages of quality, free university level courses these days &mdash
    especially in computer science, data science, machine learning, and other tech
    disciplines.

    learning material has been made available to the masses without cost. Just so
    we are clear, you are not able to enrol in this course and earn a certificate
    of completion for free. But free access to high-quality learning materials from
    a top notch university really isn't anything to scoff at, especially when this
    material is put together and taught by a leading researcher in the field.

    Graphs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/index.html)**, taught by Jure Leskovec,
    with the assistance of advisor Michele Catasta and a whole host of dedicated teaching
    assistants. The iteration of the course being shared is that from this very semester.

    able better reveal insights which may not be visible to the human eye. Given the
    potential complexity of many networks, this can be a very valuable pairing.

    Such networks are a fundamental tool for modeling social, technological, and biological
    systems. This course focuses on the computational, algorithmic, and modeling challenges
    specific to the analysis of massive graphs. By means of studying the underlying
    graph structure and its features, students are introduced to machine learning
    techniques and data mining tools apt to reveal insights on a variety of networks.

    the combination of Stanford's Machine Learning with Graphs and Hamilton's Graph
    Representation Learning Book. The no-cost access to these high quality learning
    resources should be enough to quickly get anyone interested in doing so up to
    speed on contemporary uses of machine learning for solving graph-based problems.
    If you are interested, I suggest you check them both out now.
