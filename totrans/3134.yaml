- en: Deep learning is a significant part of what makes up the broader subject of
    machine learning. Still relatively new, its popularity is constantly growing and
    so it makes sense that people would want to read and learn more about the subject.
    If only there was a comprehensive list of such resources, collated in one place,
    all completely free of charge and open for anyone to view…

- en: This collection includes books on all aspects of deep learning. It begins with
    titles that cover the subject as a whole, before moving onto work that should
    help beginners expand their knowledge from machine learning to deep learning.
    The list concludes with books that discuss neural networks, both titles that introduce
    the topic and ones that go in-depth, covering the architecture of such networks.

    mechanism of data processing, that enables computers to learn technically similar
    to a brain and even generalize once solutions to enough problem instances are
    taught. Available in English and German.

    fundamental neural network architectures and learning rules. In it, the authors
    emphasize a fundamental understanding of the principal neural networks and the
    methods for training them. The authors also discuss applications of networks to
    practical engineering problems in pattern recognition, clustering, signal processing,
    and control systems. Readability and natural flow of material is emphasized throughout
    the text.

- en: This third edition of Simon Haykin’s book provides an up-to-date treatment of
    neural networks in a comprehensive, thorough and readable manner, split into three
    sections. The book begins by looking at the classical approach on supervised learning,
    before continuing on to kernel methods based on radial-basis function (RBF) networks.
    The final part of the book is devoted to regularization theory, which is at the
    core of machine learning.
