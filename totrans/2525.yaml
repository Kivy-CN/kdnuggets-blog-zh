  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Low-code** simply stands for a reduced amount of coding. A lot of elements
    can be simply dragged and dropped from the library. However, it is also possible
    to customize them by writing your own code, which gives increased flexibility.'

    be used by different people like artists, teachers, top managers. They need AI
    in their work but don’t want to dive deep into programming and computer science.
    No-code solutions are quite limited in functionality but allow you to build something
    simple quickly.'

    Platforms that promote themselves as ‘no-code’ still usually leave some space
