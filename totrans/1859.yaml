    it is advisable to develop the ability to work with BIG DATA (!). In short: the
    main memory of a single computer is not going to cut it, and if you want to simultaneously
    train models across hundreds of virtual machines, you need to get to grips with
    distributed computation and parallel algorithms.'

    farcical. The term is continually confused and often used as an umbrella term
    for all analytics. Furthermore, massive data volumes (and the technologies to
    store and manage these quantities) are not new like they once were, so it is only
    a matter of time before it expires from our lexicon. For an expanded discussion
    on this, there is yet another sensible post from Sean McClure: *[*Data Science
    and Big Data: Two Very Different Beasts*](http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-science-big-two-very-different-beasts-sean-mcclure-ph-d-?trk=prof-post)*(this
    is getting ridiculous now – I swear I have never even talked to the guy).*'

    So if this is the type of data scientist you want to become, you do not need to
    be an engineer. However, if you want to put machine learning algorithms into production
    (i.e. Type B), you will need a strong foundation in software engineering.'

    this will take up the majority of your time*. If you fail to remove the noise
    from your dataset (e.g. wrong/missing values, non-standardised categories, etc.),
    then the accuracy of the model will be affected and will ultimately lead to incorrect
    conclusions. Therefore, if you are not prepared to spend the time and attention
    on this step, it renders your advanced technical know-how irrelevant.

    organisations and many businesses have complicated infrastructures when it comes
    to data storage. So if you are not prepared for this environment and you want
    to work with nice clean datasets, unfortunately commercial data science is not
    for you.

    data scientist should take precedence over everything else: technologies constantly
    change and can ultimately be learnt in a relatively short timeframe. But we shouldn’t
    ignore them altogether, so it is useful to be aware of the most widespread tools
    in use today.'

    you have a choice, perhaps use one of these when you are experimenting.

    intuitive dashboards is very powerful for communicating with non-technical business
    stakeholders. You might have the best model and the best insights, but if you
    cannot present/explain the findings effectively, what use is it? It really doesn’t
    matter what tool you use for visualisation – it could be R, or Tableau (which
    seems to be the most prevalent at the moment), but honestly – the tool is unimportant.

    with databases in industry; whether we are talking about relational databases,
    or derivatives of SQL used with big data technologies. And it is the bread and
    butter of data wrangling – at least when working at larger scales (i.e. not in
    memory). In summary: it really is worth investing your time into.'

    perhaps pure research (although let’s face it, there aren’t many of these positions
    around in industry), the vast majority of data science positions involve business
    interaction, often with individuals who are not analytically literate.

    actions and implications to a lay audience is absolutely crucial, particularly
    for Type A data science. I was chatting to Yanir about this, and this is how he

    are not rock stars, ninjas, unicorns or any other mythical creature. If you are
    planning on referring to yourself like this, perhaps take a long look in the mirror.
    But I digress. The point I want to make here is this: there are some data scientists
    who possess expert level ability in all of the above, and perhaps more. They are
    rare and extremely valuable. If you have the natural ability and desire to become
    one of these, then great – you are going to be hot property. But if not, remember:
    you can specialise in certain areas of data science, and quite often, good teams
    are comprised of data scientists with different specialities. Deciding what to
    focus on goes back to your interests and capability, and this leads us nicely
    to the next chapter in our journey.'
