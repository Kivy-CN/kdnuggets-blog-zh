- en: There are many great boosting Python libraries for data scientists to reap the
    benefits of. Some include XGBoost, and the new CatBoost algorithm. However, there
    is one algorithm that combines some of both of these other algorithm characteristics,
    making it a must for data scientists. The benefits are of course great in learning
    and education, but more importantly, for working in a quick, professional environment
    that requires an algorithm that is fast. Below, I will discuss [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ.html)
    [1] benefits and how they are specific to your data science job.

- en: Perhaps the best feature of this library is the categorical feature support.
    Whereas a lot of data scientists might use one-hot encoding to create tons of
    new columns for only one categorical feature, this library allows you to specify
    the categorical features with the categorical_feature parameter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While one-hot encoding is useful, in academia, inside your Jupyter Notebook,
    for example, it can be less useful in the professional setting. Say you have 10
    categorical features with 100 unique bins, that can be expanded to 1,000 new columns.
    Not only does this make your dataframe sparse, but it also makes your model incredibly
    slower. Another stressful outcome for this sparsity is when you have to translate
    your features into production code for software engineers working on your prediction
    service and deployment. This transferring of responsibilities (*if you have that
    setup, of course*), can be confusing and overwhelming for both parties to have
    to deal with.

    LightGBM also has a few other tricks to improve your training and prediction speeds.
    LigthGBM uses both GOSS and EFB, or Gradient-based One-Side Sampling, and Exclusive
    Feature Binding, as well as histogram-based splitting.

- en: All XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM are accurate models. Yes, it depends on
    your problem, features, and data ultimately, but in general, these algorithms
    lead to accurate results after you have performed the necessary steps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because you can use categorial features, you will are likely to have an accurate
    model, more so, than an algorithm that can only perform one-hot encoding. The
    way that LightGBM splits can lead to more accurate models as well. It is important
    to note that you will want to prevent overfitting though.
