    and keep you occupied. Compared to many other roles, data scientists can be given
    a lot of autonomy to explore and solve interesting problems. And, in many cases,
    you’ll get the opportunity to work with talented and skilled people in a variety
    of domains.

    roles, according to this [Kaggle survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017).
    In fact, those working in machine learning regularly top lists of developers looking
    for new roles — 20.5% in the [2020 Developer Survey from Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020),

    or from a research position in academia. It’s easy to fall into an infinite timescale,
    infinite budget mindset. All too often, I’ve heard protests from data scientists
    saying they can’t put a timeline on when their work will be finished, and it’ll
    take as long as it takes. This simply isn’t true and won’t fit well with the culture
    at most organisations.

    deal of the job isn’t terribly exciting. In most organisations, you’ll have to
    spread your time between doing technical work and the other, less exciting stuff.
    This can be an issue if you’re not keen on reporting, writing, and delivering
    presentations, repeatedly explaining the basics of your models or approaches,
    project management, and administrative overhead, or trying to get buy-in from
    other parts of the organisation.

    who’d been there 18 months had spent the entire time building some fundamental
