    data analytics students in the Alteryx for Good Data Challenge held at February’s
    Alteryx Inspire conference in Sydney. The competition, co-sponsored by Alteryx
    partner RXP, brought new analytic approaches and insights to these invaluable
    organizations.

    their data needs, participating also benefited the students, who gained new skills
    with real-world problems and added to their personal networks. (You can hear about
    their experiences [in this podcast episode](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alter-Everything-Podcast/59-Reporting-from-Australia-an-Alteryx-for-Good-Data-Challenge/ba-p/565871)!)

    and collaborate, both longtime Community folks and newer [ADAPT](https://www.alteryx.com/why-alteryx/alteryx-for-good/adapt-program) participants.
    Registration is closed for that hackathon, but keep an eye out for future opportunities.
    Other online communities, like LinkedIn and Facebook groups for data professionals,
    will likely share posts about similar events.

    competitions focus on for-profit companies’ data and needs, but there are sometimes
    opportunities to look at nonprofits’ data and offer solutions for them. For example, [this
    competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions) looks at
    social and environmental issues in cities to address questions around sustainability. [Another
    competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-str-pulmonary-embolism-detection),
    coordinated by medical organizations, focuses on diagnosing pulmonary embolism
    based on image analysis. Both of these offer substantial cash prizes!'

    or coach. Through our own [Alteryx for Good](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-For-Good/ct-p/afg) program,
    I recently served as a judge for a data case competition run by the [Information
    Systems & Business Analytics Students Society](https://uoaibss.co.nz/) at the
    University of Auckland. It was inspiring and fun to see these impressive students
    apply their Alteryx skills, their critical thinking, and their analytic mindset
    to the challenge.

    if you prefer to operate independently or can’t commit to a competition or organization.
    Come up with your own project and find publicly available data that could help
    you address it in some way, whether through modeling, data visualization, app
    building, data storytelling, or any other approach. For example, we recently shared
    lists of data sources related to [COVID-19](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alter-Nation/Data-Wizards-Unite-Use-Your-Skills-to-Fight-COVID-19/ba-p/545240) and
