    a series of posts designed to highlight the Top 10 use cases from the [IBM Machine
    Learning Hub](http://ibm-ml-hub.com/). In particular, we’re eager to share scenarios
    that can stretch our understanding about machine learning — compliments of our
    collaborations with data scientists from across our client base.

    cases that come to mind when considering a particular sector. For example, Part
    1 focused on government but looked beyond the role of ML in sentencing and parole
    to explore use cases driving vital improvements to regional and municipal agencies.
    Here in Part 2, we’ll look beyond the role of ML in oncology and radiology to
    its influence on mental health, whole-life health, and reducing re-admission rates.

    patient stay to ER wait times to direct surveys of service. High on the list of
    metrics is the re-admission rate, defined as the return of a discharged patient
    to the hospital or clinic within some specified amount of time. Readmissions can
    create huge costs — and hassle — for providers, insurers, and patients alike.

    a lens into the factors that impact readmission. Starting as an effort to anticipate
    readmission rates, the predictive modeling and cognitive evaluation models aggregated
    many factors: doctors’ notes, healthcare annotators, social factors, patient demographics,
    and more. Not only did the models help improve prediction accuracy by 47 percent,
    they helped isolate factors that work to reduce re-admission rates across the
    board, keep patients healthier, and save money.'

    care in its own health centers through a wide network of affiliates. For years,
    they’ve coordinated primary and specialty care, diagnostic testing, hospital services,
    and follow-up care.

    the data they capture is giving them incredible power to personalize health care
    plans that serve patients better, smooth the transitions between centers of care,
    build trust, and slash costs. Doing so means running deep analytics on the combination
    of patient data, risk factors, and proactive solutions.

    any standard — but even more so for researchers eager to bring the insights from
    their labs and clinics into real-world programs for helping struggling individuals
    to improve their lives. That’s the mandate of a research institution in the northeastern
    US that worked with IBM to organize, maintain, and mine their research for trends
    in the data that could inform the interventions they undertake. With help from
    IBM offerings, they built a system that tracks results across research environments,
    across patients, and across time.

    ability to substantiate the rigor of their findings — and the results of their
    interventions — helps convince funders to support the institution’s vital work.

    prescription info, wearable sensors, and more, providers are poised to use machine
    learning to root out inefficiency and dazzle patients with improved services and
    outcomes. Progress relies on all of us to see and advocate for the opportunities.
    Let’s continue to evangelize for [machine learning](http://ibm.biz/machinelearning) — and
    to keep sharing the new visions for bringing it to bear.
