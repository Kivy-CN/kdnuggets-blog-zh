- en: Anthropic has recently launched a new series of AI models that have outperformed
    both GPT-4 and Gemini in benchmark tests. With the AI industry growing and evolving
    rapidly, Claude 3 models are making significant strides as the next big thing
    in Large Language Models (LLMs).

    Claude 3, reviewed its benchmark, and tested its vision capabilities. We also
    learned to generate simple, async, and stream responses. It's too early to say
    if it's the best LLM out there, but if we look at the official test benchmarks,
    we have a new king on the throne of AI.
