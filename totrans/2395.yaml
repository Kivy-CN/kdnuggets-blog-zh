- en: Developing machine learning models involves a lot of steps. Whether you’re working
    with labeled or unlabeled data, you might think numbers are just numbers, and
    it doesn’t matter what each of the features of a dataset signifies when it comes
    to spitting out insights with the potential for true impact. It’s true that there
    are tons of great machine learning libraries out there like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
    which make it straightforward to gather up some data and plop them into a cookie-cutter
    model. Pretty quickly, you might start to think there’s no problem you can’t solve
    with machine learning.

- en: Frankly, that’s a beginner’s mindset. You are not yet aware of everything you
    don’t know. Datasets given in machine learning courses or the free ones you find
    online have often already been groomed and are convenient to use when applying
    machine learning models, but once you take your skills and knowledge out of the
    play-pen and into the real world, you’ll face some additional challenges.
  prefs: []

- en: Lots of people believe that domain knowledge, or additional knowledge regarding
    the industry or area the data pertains to, is superfluous. And it’s kind of true.
    Do you NEED domain knowledge in the area you’re developing the model? No. You
    can still produce fairly accurate models without it. Theoretically, deep and machine
    learning are black-box approaches. This means you can put labeled data into a
    model without deep knowledge of the area and without even looking at the data
    very closely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, if you go down this route though, you’ll have to deal with the consequences.
    This is a very inefficient way to train classifiers, and in order to properly
    function, you’ll require massive amounts of labeled datasets and a lot of computational
    power in order to produce accurate models.

- en: If you incorporate domain knowledge into your architecture and your model, it
    can make it a lot easier to explain the results, both to yourself and to an outside
    viewer. Every bit of domain knowledge can serve as a stepping stone through the
    black box of a machine learning model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's very easy to think that domain knowledge isn’t required because for lots
    of visible datasets like [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home), the limited domain
    knowledge that is required is part of being a seeing human. Even more complex
    data sets that contain cancer cells are similarly obvious to the human eye, despite
    a lack of expert-level knowledge. You can do basic evaluation of similarity or
    differences between cells without any specific medical knowledge.

- en: Natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision are prime examples of
    areas where it’s easy to think that domain knowledge is entirely unnecessary,
    but more so because they are such normal tasks for us, we may not even notice
    how we’re applying our domain knowledge.

    human task, the importance of domain knowledge quickly becomes apparent.

    step of the machine learning model development cycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a dataset, not every data point has the same value. If you collect 100 new
    samples which are identical, they don’t help the model learn any additional information.
    They might actually focus the model in a specific direction which isn’t important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re looking at 100 pictures of umbrellas, and you know this model is supposed
    to classify all kinds of accessories, it’s clear that your sample dataset isn’t
    representative of the whole population. Without domain knowledge, it can be very
    challenging to know which data points add value or if they are already represented
    in the data set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re working in an area that doesn’t so easily lend itself to your existing
    general knowledge, you can build in biases through the training data which can
    hurt the accuracy and robustness of your model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way in which domain knowledge can pack a punch in the data pre-processing
    step is in determining feature importance. If you have a good feel for the importance
    of each feature, you can develop better strategies to process the data accordingly.
    It’s really important to understand what the actual features are in order to do
    so. This has a big influence on how you handle the features going forward.

- en: There are many different machine learning models, and some may be more fitting
    than others given many factors. Is the data labeled or unlabeled? How much data
    do you have? What kind of data types are the features? Are the data types of the
    features homogeneous? Is your target output a continuous value or a classification?
    Choosing the right model is important, but it’s very rare to be able to apply
    your selected model directly without making adjustments to it. Random forests,
    for example, can handle heterogeneous data types right out of the box.
  prefs: []

    there are lots of resources out there to help you make your selection if you’re
    not quite a machine learning expert. I’ve gathered my top three from machine learning
    cheat sheets from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-minutes-cheat-sheet-explaining-all-machine-learning-models-3fea1cf96f05),

    adjustments have been made over the last few decades to better apply machine learning
    models in many areas. Domain knowledge has definitely been applied to the models
    used in natural language processing. Let’s walk through a few examples of how
    these developments came about.

- en: If you think about numbers and words, there’s a pretty big difference in how
    we think about them. If you have the heights of everyone in a group, you can easily
    spit out some stats regarding the median, outliers, etc, all based on height.
    If everyone in the group gave you a word to represent how they are feeling today,
    how would you convert that to any kind of meaningful aggregate?
  prefs: []

- en: You should consider what you can do to create a digital representation of a
    word. Should you just use letters? Does that make sense? As a person who speaks
    the language, we immediately have the meaning behind the word. We do not store
    words by their letters. Think about a tree. Did you picture a tree or did your
    mind go to t-r-e-e? Storing the representation of a word as the letters doesn’t
    really bring us any advantage when it comes to understanding meaning or significance.

    are “a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have
    a similar [numerical] representation”. The numerical representations are learned
    using [unsupervised learning models](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/overview-of-machine-learning-algorithms-unsupervised-learning/).'

    This numerical representation goes so far as to allow you to use the Euclidean
    distance between two-word representations to quantify how similar two words are
    used in the training text.

    each field of the vector represents is certainly unclear as they’re developed
    using unsupervised learning, but it makes sense that a word that represents a
    similar concept has a similar representation as far as the model understands.

    [the early 2000s](https://aylien.com/blog/a-review-of-the-recent-history-of-natural-language-processing).
    Around 2013, [long short-term memory](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/lstm-for-text-classification/)
    (LSTM) debuted in the field and dominated for a few years. An LTSM model reads
    the sentence, creates a hidden representation, and then uses the hidden representation
    to generate the output sentence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As humans, if we translate, we don’t just read the sentence and spit out the
    translation. We tend to look at the whole sentence again and again, or we’ll focus
    on certain parts when we want to revisit the context of the target word.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example the word “read”. Is it representing present or past tense? Which
    other parts of the sentence do you focus on to determine that? Do you need information
    from surrounding sentences? “I read books every year” means one thing on its own,
    but if I were to say, “I did many things before I went to university. I read books
    every year. I ate dinner with my parents every day,” the sentence takes on a different
    meaning, and “read” represents an action that took place in the present in the
    first example and in the past for the second.
  prefs: []

- en: Attention builds these relationships between different words in the sentence
    or sentences. For each word we want to translate, it highlights different words
    in the original sentence according to the importance of these associated words
    with the target word. Someone who isn’t an experienced or professional translator
    might just translate word-for-word, and while the general information would still
    be conveyed, accounting for the importance of associated words when translating
    the target word will produce a much more accurate translation. Attention allows
    us to build that professional translation pattern into the architecture of the
    deep learning model.

    model which spits out some numbers. With domain knowledge, you’ll know what data
    is best to use to train and test your model. You will also realize how you can
    tailor the model you use to better represent the data set and the problem you’re
    trying to tackle, and how to make the best use of the insights your model produces.

    you to take the impact of your machine learning skills to a much higher level
    of significance.
