- en: If you wanted to classify animals, for example, based on a plethora of relevant
    collected data, you would quickly find that all sorts of potential data attributes,
    or features, were relatively unhelpful for classification. For example, given
    that most living creatures have precisely 1 heart, this particular feature would
    not be beneficial, from a learning perspective. On the other hand, an attribute
    denoting whether or not a given animal is hoofed would likely be a powerful predictor.

- en: Further, using all of these irrelevant attributes, mixed in with the powerful
    predictors, may actually have a negative effect on the resulting model. This is
    to say nothing of the increased training times that may come along with the inclusion
    of useless attributes, or the overfitting which may occur on the training data.

    attributes, to be used in the predictive modeling process. Feature selection is
    useful on a variety of fronts: it is the best weapon against the Curse of Dimensionality;
    it can reduce overall training times; and it is a powerful defense against overfitting,
    increasing model generalizability.'

    there is one conclusion: There''s NOTHING like a good Feature Selection.'

    and generalization power can be leveraged by a correct feature selection, based
    in correlation, skewness, t-test, ANOVA, entropy and information gain.

    Machine Learning models. Consider the picture below (Support Vector Machine classification
    of the IRIS dataset): on the left side a wrong variable selection is presented.
    The linear kernel cannot handle the classification task properly, neither the
    radial basis function kernel. On the right side, petal width and petal length
    were selected as features and even the linear kernel is quite accurate. A correct
    variable selection, a good algorithm choice and hyperparameter tuning are the
    keys to success. Picture below made with Python.'

- en: In a time when ample processing power can tempt us to think that feature selection
    may not be as relevant as it once was, it's important to remember that this only
    accounts for one of the numerous benefits of informed feature selection -- decreased
    training times. As Zimbres notes above, with a simple concrete example, feature
    selection can quite literally mean the difference between valid, generalizable
    models and a big waste of time.
