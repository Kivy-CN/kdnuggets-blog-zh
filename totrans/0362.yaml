    Labor Statistics still [predicts](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm)
    it will grow 36 percent over the next ten years, which is much faster than the
    average American job industry growth rate of 5 percent. But as any of the thousands
    of laid-off data scientists can tell you, statistics aren’t a shield against unemployment.
    The answer? Some experts suggest specializing is one of the best ways to stand
    out and make yourself unfireable.  “As data’s influence grows and technology advances,
    specific roles on data teams will be needed to maximize efficiency,” [writes](https://fortune.com/education/articles/data-science-predictions-for-2023-according-to-the-ceo-of-simon-data/)

    I was a run-of-the-mill generalist data scientist. I was constantly learning new
    skills and technologies to stay on top of the rapidly evolving field. But of course,
    the day came when I realized I needed to differentiate myself. I decided to specialize
    in infrastructure and how to enable data science work through infrastructure.
    My work in infrastructure changed the day the data scientists on my team worked,
    empowering them to deliver models and results faster than before.
  prefs: []

- en: After several years of focusing on data science infrastructure, I landed a job
    in data strategy in the biotech field. I quickly realized that my specialization
    gave me a significant advantage in the job market, as there were few people with
    the specific skills and experience that I had. This also meant that I was able
    to command a higher salary and a higher position, as the deep knowledge I gained
    specializing in one focal area propelled me to a more senior position solely because
    I had more knowledge and experience to influence other data scientists on my team.

    depending on your current situation and your overarching goal.

    was the only way to avoid getting fired by his capricious boss.

    As a specialist, you’re much more valuable. It’s much easier to say, “No, we can’t

    helps us make all our marketing and sales pipelines. He’s crucial for the team.”
