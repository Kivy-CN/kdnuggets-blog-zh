- en: 2012 was a big year in Great Britain. The country was awash with national pride.
    Union Jacks proudly flying at full mast across most British streets and a feverish
    party atmosphere, as we hosted arguably the best ever Olympic Games. During the
    games, we witnessed the prominent rise and rightful public recognition of the
    athleticism of disabled athletes, competing in the Paralympics and Special Olympics.
    Tanni Grey-Thompson, Ellie Simmonds and Lee Pearson are now just as likely to
    be debated as Britain’s best Olympians from those games, alongside Mo Farah and
    Bradley Wiggins, amongst friends down the pub. Whatever stigma previously existed
    was smashed to bits, as our heroic athletes brought home gold medal after gold
    medal.

- en: As a result of the games, we are now seeing society becoming far more understanding
    and inclusive of the disabled community, but with the United Nations reporting
    that around 15% of the world’s population suffer with some type of disability,
    there is a growing feeling that we need to do more, to help make the lives of
    people with disabilities easier.

    in the last few years, and several practitioners are taking a more philanthropic
    outlook on life, supporting people suffering with both physical and mental disabilities.

    support of people suffering with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is a condition
    suffered by approximately 1 in every 100 people, with men more likely to be diagnosed
    with the condition than women. It affects children at around age 3, and results
    in the child having difficulty processing or engaging in human interaction or
    emotion, which can make integrating into groups of other children very difficult.
    However, the London Knowledge Lab was incredibly successful in introducing a group
    of ASD children to a virtual autonomous robot called Andy. The experiment found
    that the children interacted readily with Andy, listening intently, asking and
    answering questions far more freely than if it had been a human adult. Similarly,
    an artificial intelligence robot called Milo has been rolled out to over 50 schools
    in the United States to encourage children with ASD to interact more readily face
    to face, and in some cases, even permit physical contact from the robot, unthinkable
    for the majority of ASD sufferers. While there is no recognised cure for ASD at
    present, the experiment offers hope to the families of children and adults suffering
    with ASD, that they might one day be so comfortable conversing with artificial
    intelligence software that they might grow in confidence in their interactions
    with other people.

    in order to make the lives of disabled people easier. For many amputees or people
    living without the use of one or more limbs, the options are very limited, and
    often very rudimentary, focusing on bare essential rather than everyday usability.
    However, Deka Research, headed up by Segway inventor Dean Kamen, have pioneered
    a prosthesis they call the ‘Luke’ arm (named in tribute after Luke Skywalker).
    The unique aspect of this piece of technology is that its modelled more closely
    on the internal workings of a human arm, with the mechanical equivalent of tendons,
    muscles and bones allowing the user a much more natural range of motion, closer
    to a human arm than to the hooks and claws that have been more prevalent in the
    last 20 years. The arm itself can be controlled in several ways: with microscopic
    nerve endings attached to the base of the arm, or controllers in the wearer’s
    shoes. The project was granted a significant financial boost by the US Army Research
    Office, but the prostheses are likely to still be incredibly expensive to produce
    on a mass scale, with some estimates at around the $50,000 mark. While this may
    not be the answer for everyone who needs a prosthetic, the range of movement and
    sophistication of technology on show here is a brilliant sign for the future,
    when similar technologies will be available for less cost, and potentially with
    even more uses.'

    famous scientists, Professor Stephen Hawking, the electronic augmentative and
    alternative communication system (AAC) has become integral to the lives of those
    people who are unable to speak due to conditions such as motor neurone disease
    or cerebral palsy. One of the latest innovations in this market, and still closely
    related to the ‘Equaliser’ device used by Hawking from 1986 onwards, is the DynaVox
    EyeMax. This device uses Computer Vision techniques, via a front-facing camera
    to track the movements of the user’s eyes across the screen of commands, and can
    even be programmed to use certain intonation in order for the speech to not be
    misconstrued. It has the potential to use Natural Language Processing to give
    speech to a large number of people who may have lost the ability, but there are
    some limitations to the technology; each device must be individually programmed
    for the respective user, to include places of interest, names of friends and family
    and other unique information, and the cost of the devices is not often covered
    by health insurance. It is expected however that the inclusion of deep learning
    technology into the devices in future should reduce the time taken to program
    the device, which could bring the cost of the devices down to a more affordable
    level.

    and philanthropically, of using data science technologies to improve the lives
    of disabled people. Google recently announced that they were looking to boost
    the accessibility of their smartphones and other devices for users who might have
    limited or no use of their sight, hearing or dexterity. One of the most exciting
    and unique developments is a Braille system for use with Google smartphones, which
    allows users to connect a Braille device to their phone via Bluetooth. In addition,
    Android systems can now be controlled by ‘switches’, not dissimilar to those used
    by Stephen Hawking in his wheelchair. This, according to Google, opens them up
    to a new group of users who previously would not have been able to access this
    technology, and allows users to use the same hardware as their friends rather
    than having something custom-made and potentially less appealing. There is a huge
    financial incentive to these developments, as both Switch Access and BrailleBack
    are free to download for Android, meaning that unlike many technologies designed
    for the disabled community, price does not have to be a barrier. Overall, Google’s
    contribution has laid down a benchmark for other technology companies to follow
    their lead in producing affordable and easy-to-use platforms for those with disabilities,
    and we look forward to see who steps up next.

    stage right now, but shows enormous potential for the future. In 2011 Dr Dennis
    Hong, from Virginia Tech University’s RoMeLa Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory,
    pioneered a car that was designed for blind or partially-sighted people to be
    able to drive independently. Using a system that combined machine learning software
    that was able to learn a pre-determined route and sense obstacles and pedestrians,
    and a series of sensors packed into pressure-pad gloves, that would tell the driver
    where they should be going and if there was an impeding obstacle that needed to
    be avoided. During his TED talk in the same year, Dr Hong demonstrated the car
    with a blind person driving, doing a whole lap of a pre-determined course safely
    at the Daytona Speedway. It must be noted that there are a few reasons why this
    system could not be implemented immediately, least of which is that the route
    had to be meticulously entered into the car’s computer in order for the sensors
    to direct the driver, and this would not be feasible for every road. However,
    it shows enormous progress in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning,
    and a huge leap forward for the blind and partially sighted community as a whole.

    Data Science and Disability can be labelled a success. Firstly, are the technological
    innovations that are beginning to emerge at an advanced enough stage to benefit
    those who are suffering from a disability now, or is the real breakthrough likely
    to come in 5-10 years? Similarly, are these options all financially viable, not
    for the producer, but for the consumer, who might only have limited income as
    a result of their income? Furthermore, are innovations offered by Data Science
    limited to making the lives of disabled people easier, or is there scope, for
    example, for deep learning being used to identify the genes that cause certain
    disabilities, giving doctors the chance to study and limit the genes in the future?

- en: The future for Data Science looks incredibly bright, as several innovations
    are already making marked differences to the lives of disabled people around the
    world. The next step, whether that be into genetics research, deep learning integration
    or another field, is dependent on whether many of the major companies will look
    past the finance sheets and instead look to improve the lives of the many millions
    of disabled people all over the world. Let’s hope it doesn’t have to take until
    the next Olympic Games, until they do.
