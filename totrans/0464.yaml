    fields, and it doesn’t have a gold standard on what skills you need to acquire
    to be called a professional data scientist. This is where [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/certification) certification
    comes in to access your knowledge and skills. Just like in the world of computer
    networks, the [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html) certification
    is a gold standard. Similarly, DataCamp is accessing an individual’s skills by
    conducting various challenges.

    I was a professional data scientist working with various companies on various
    projects. Initially, I thought it was a piece of cake for me, but in reality,
    it was challenging, and I had to give my 100 percent to clear all the stages.
    The certification challenges are designed to filter out 90 percent of candidates
    and award only a few individuals with specialized skills. In this guide, we are
    going to learn each step in detail, and I will give you tips and tricks to pass
    all the stages.

    skills of individuals and their ability to solve data problems. In my case, I
    had to clean the data, add additional features, and finally use statistical tools
    to come up with a solution. This challenge can be solved within 30 minutes but

    you need to gain the required skill either by practicing on projects or completing
    the data science skill path. Then, start with a timed assessment on DataCamp.
    After that, move to code challenge and case study. It’s that simple, but not everyone
    is getting certified because candidates are making mistakes of jumping throughout
    the course. You need to gain enough experience and skills to get certified by
    DataCamp. So start working on the tips I have shared and jump-start your career
    as *Data Scientist*.
