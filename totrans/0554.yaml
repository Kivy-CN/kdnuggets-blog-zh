    when I was last was on the market, but instead of using these challenges to prolong
    our dreams of becoming a Data Scientist or end them in a worst case scenario,
    I’ve endeavored to better understand these challenges so I could come up with
    some solutions to make them work best in my favor, and now yours!

    personal and technical skills based on job descriptions would be mislead regarding
    the requirements to fulfill a role. Another issue with this is that recruiters

    what the potential reason for an outlandish job description may be as some scenarios
    may be harmful to your growth as a Data Scientist, such as being a jack of all
    trades.

    are merely a wish-list from the company, and they want to hire someone they believe
    has the ability to solve a real problem they actually have.
  prefs: []

    others (the companies) to perceive you have what it takes to tackle their challenges.
    Additionally, if you meet at least 50% of requirements on any job description,
    then you’re probably qualified and should definitely attempt to go for the role
    — if you meet the job description 100%, you’re probably overqualified.

    the real world, there’s a point we move past the experimental phase. I believe
    it should be expected of every Data Scientist to know how to spin up a Jupyter
    Notebook, but as Data Science is becoming more productionized, bonus points are
    given to the Data Scientist that can write production-level code because you’ll
    be saving cost and time.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fact that it’s difficult to get a job in Data Science should never be the
    reason you don’t have one. There are many challenges you’ll face at any job in
    itself, and getting the job is just the qualification phase to see if the employers
    believe you are capable of facing the challenges and whether you believe the employers
    are whom you would like to be on your team. Always seek to improve yourself, don’t
    wait to be ready to apply because you may never feel ready, and don’t be afraid
    to be rejected or to reject companies that don’t align with where you are going.
