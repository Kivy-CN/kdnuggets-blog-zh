    seen enough debates on the internet on which language is better. Even on this
    website ( an industry bellwether)  I could count four such articles  [here](/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html) by
    Datacamp ,[Stichfix](/2015/03/the-grammar-data-science-python-vs-r.html), by a [debate](/2015/05/r-vs-python-meetup-report.html) and
    by a [KDnuggets poll](/2015/07/poll-primary-analytics-language-r-python.html).
    Well if Data Science and Data Scientists can not decide on what data to choose
    to help them decide which language to use, here is an article on how to use BOTH.

- en: Both are good stable languages with interesting complementary qualities. You
    can get much better packages in one and then stich them with some data from the
    other. An example is using time series forecasting (forecast::auto.arima) and
    decision trees in R ([http://www.statmethods.net/<wbr>advstats/cart.html](http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cart.html))
    and doing data munging in Python.

    Hadley Wickham (Rstudio) borrows from Beautiful Soup (python) to make [rvest](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/) for
    web scraping. Yhat borrows from `sqldf` to make [pandasql](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/pandasql-sql-for-pandas-dataframes.html). Rather
    than  reinvent the wheel in the other language developers can focus on innovation

    Python an R
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use a Python package `rpy2` to use R within Python . You can see examples [here](https://sites.google.com/site/aslugsguidetopython/data-analysis/pandas/calling-r-from-python) You
    can also use Python from within R using the [rPython](http://www.programmingr.com/content/calling-python-r-rpython/) package

    The Jupyter project is named after Julia Python and R and makes the interactivity
    of iPython available to other languages

    by Jupyter, Beaker Notebook allows you to switch from one language in one code
    block to another language in another code block in a streamlined way to pass shared
    objects (data)

- en: I wish I could say all these methods are simple and streamlined but they are
    not. I enjoy Python’s power in data munging and I enjoy R’s huge library of packages
    and functions for statistics. Will using R and Python together grow in the future. Let’s
    see. But in case you did not know, you can also use [SAS language with R and Python](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/05/call-r-and-python-from-base-sas.html)(using
    Java). Now that is cool for sure.
