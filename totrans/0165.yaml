- en: The Pathways Language Model (PaLM) has been updated with improved multilingual,
    reasoning, and coding capabilities. This new model is more capable of understanding
    and generating text in multiple languages, as well as reasoning and coding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2) was trained on a massive dataset
    of text and code in over 100 languages. To improve its reasoning capabilities,
    the developers included scientific papers and web pages with mathematical expressions.
    PaLM 2 was also pre-trained on publicly available source code in various programming
    languages. As a result, it is a top-of-the-line, next-generation language model
    that is powering various Google services.'

    for 7 days. I have seen drastic changes in the way Bard handles coding problems.
    Bard is not perfect, but I think Google is on the right track.

    Bard was able to create the game, but it had several bugs and reduced functionality.
    The new Bard was able to create a working snake game with all of the expected
    features.

    Google has announced Google service and third-party integrations. It means you

    for all of your work-related tasks. The team is constantly working to improve
    the model and add new features, and they are on the right track to overtake GPT-4\.
    However, there are still a few areas where Bard could improve, such as its ability
    to handle code-related problems and its integration with Google Search. If Bard
    can address these issues, I believe it will be a truly revolutionary tool that
    can change the way we work.
