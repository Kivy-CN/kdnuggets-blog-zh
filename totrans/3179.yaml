    to everyone, to the “common masses.” History provides democratization lessons
    from the Industrial and Information Revolutions. Both of these moments in history
    were driven by the standardization of parts, tools, architectures, interfaces,
    designs and trainings that allowed for the creation of common platforms. Instead
    of being dependent upon a “high priesthood” of specialists to assemble your guns
    or cars or computer systems, organizations of all sizes where able to leverage
    common platforms to build their own sources of customer, business and financial
    differentiation.

- en: Image recognition of the human body is expected to improve drastically to help
    doctors with better and more accurate medical diagnostics. ML applied to image
    recognition of organs, even in the presence of disease, can minimize the possibility
    of medical errors and speed up disease diagnosis. This is important in many cases
    because a delay in diagnosis means delays in treatment. Due to the promise of
    these methods, medical imaging technologies will have a key role in the future
    of medical diagnostics and therapeutics in the very near future.

- en: For this engagement, we used Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) from the Cancer
    Imaging Archives to identify bladder cancer on patients using unsupervised and
    supervised ML techniques. The algorithms identified significant differences between
    the images and enabled physicians to see what features can be relevant for bladder
    cancer detection.  ML can use techniques to reduce the noise of the images and
    to deliver better outcomes (see Figure 4).
