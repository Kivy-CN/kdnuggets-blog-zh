    Data Scientist](../Images/b5d95968c8431ae21ec71cdaeecb2da7.png)It is no surprise
    today that Data Scientist (or related roles such as Data Manager, Statistician,
    Data Analyst, etc.) is one of the most sought career paths. In response to this
    cross-industry trend, several top universities have started programs dedicated
    to Data Science.'

    business leaders, many people are moving towards the Data Scientist career path
    without a thorough careful assessment of the day-to-day responsibilities of such
    a role, the required attitude; and balance of technical and business skills.

    the data scientist role, which they can assess against their personality and career
    ambitions, I recently discussed this with **[Paco Nathan](http://liber118.com/pxn/)**,
    a data science expert with 25+ years of industry experience. His candid, detailed
    response is very likely to be an eye-opener for many.

    Monsanto launched a private equity firm in SF that, practically speaking, can
    invest more money at more favorable terms into Ag data ventures than just about
    any VC firm. Meanwhile, VCs in the area have all but ignored data­related ventures
    in domains that matter — with the exception of Khosla. In the past several months
    they’ve acquired business units within SV: Climate Corp, Solum, etc., which by
    the way were funded by Khosla. Expect more of that trend.'

    budget goes into the priesthood of “data engineering”, and far too much budget
    tends to be earmarked for data that’s already cleaned up. Also, I find that the
    notion of “Product Management” in SV is almost antithetically opposed to effective
    use of data: in many cases product managers are incentivized to discourage use
    of data within companies.'

    executives and get the company back on track. Again, industry disruptions have

    just starting out, be really careful about where you go to work. If a firm claims
    to have “excellent engineering” but insufficient use of data circa 2014, then
    they are *not* the sharpest tools on the workbench; pick some other firm in which
    to start. Find mentors. Join teams that have strong sponsorship from Finance or
    Operations (which generally understand data and variance) while perhaps avoiding
    teams that have sponsorship from Engineering or Marketing (which generally do
    not understand effective use of data).'
