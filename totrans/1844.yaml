- en: The effective use of Data Science technologies requires new competences and
    skills and demands for new professions that should support all stages of the research
    data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing, storing, and
    obtained scientific results publishing and dissemination. This paper introduces
    the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) that include conceptual, instructional
    and policy components required to establish sustainable graduation and training
    of the future Data Science professionals.

    all stages of the research data lifecycle from data production and input to data
    processing, storing, and scientific results publishing and dissemination, which
    can jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The future Data Scientists
    must possess knowledge (and obtain competencies and skills) in data mining and
    analytics, information visualisation and communication, as well as in statistics,
    engineering and computer science, and acquire experiences in the specific research
    or industry domain of their future work and specialisation. Although the Data
    Scientist is a key occupation in the data related professions family, other occupation
    are focused on other stages of the data lifecycle and supporting infrastructure.

    (DS-BoK), the knowledge needed by the professionals to perform all data related
    processes of their profession. The BoK typically defines the content of a curriculum
    and is linked to CF-DS via learning outcomes that can be defined for the specific

    need to cover in their programs depending on their primary demand groups in research
    or industry. The domain specific knowledge can be acquired as a part of the academic
    education or as a post-graduate professional training at the graduate’s work place.
    It is also commonly recognized that a “fresh” Data Scientist would require 2-3
    year to become proficient in his/her profession.

    outcomes (LO) based on the CF-DS competences, including their differentiation
    for different proficiency levels, e.g. using Bloom’s Taxonomy, (2) definition
    of the Learning Units (LU) that map to the LOs for target professional groups,
    which need to be defined in accordance with the  existing academic disciplines
    classification such as Classification Computer Science (CCS, 2012).'

    organisations and their Human Resources department to successfully manage competences
    and career development of the data related jobs. The proposed DS-CF has been widely
    discussed at numerous workshops and community forums. It is already used by few
    institutions associated with the EDISON project. The published for public comments
    DS-BoKand MC-DS documents will require further development and validation by experts
    and communities of practice to define specific knowledge areas. It will be done
    by involving experts in the related knowledge areas, also engaging with the specific
    professional communities such as IEEE, ACM, DAMA, IIBA, etc. The project will
    engage with the partner and champion universities into pilot implementation of
    DS-BoK and MC-DS and collecting feedback from practitioners. All EDISON project
