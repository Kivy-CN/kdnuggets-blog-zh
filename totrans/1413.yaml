    with data mainly focused on the United States, with some additional geographic
    data sprinkled in for good measure. With the recent release of [Big Cloud's annual
    survey reports](https://bigcloud.io/salary-reports/) on data science professionals
    by geographic region, we now have some quality data and visualizations to help
    us gain a better understanding of what data scientists are worth worldwide.

    data science professionals report to be using, salaries for these professionals,
    and insights of interest from the report.

    of all backgrounds, ages and locations within the European region. The largest
    share of contributions this year were from Germany, France, UK, Netherlands and
    Switzerland. Because these were our greatest data points, these countries are
    the primary focus for us in this report.

    related roles, this quickly moves into the territory of comparing apples to oranges.
    In order to draw meaningful comparisons, we will look at the data points of "data
    scientist" and "senior data scientist" mean salary, median salary, average increase,
    and average bonus for each of the 6 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands,
    Switzerland, UK) with the highest numbers of respondents (see Figure 4), countries
    which the report, itself, highlights.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Europe is certainly not a monolith, and this is evident in the survey responses.
    There are salary discrepancies between countries, to be sure, but this does not,
    itself, tell a complete story without consideration given to cost of living differences.
    While should be obvious and is beyond the scope of a salary survey, it is worth
    noting explicitly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One item that sticks out beyond the raw numbers was participants' perception
    that availability of alternate data science positions and ease of being able to
    transfer into one seemed relatively low. That is a personal perception, but when
    it comes to deciding whether or not to search for a new role, perception is just
    as important as reality.
