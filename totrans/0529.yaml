    science?”*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the field is becoming saturated. After all, there are a limited amount of AI jobs,
    especially during a global recession.

- en: First off, let’s talk about intrapreneurship. AI has become far easier and faster
    to build and deploy than ever before — especially given no-code AI tools like [Obviously.AI](http://obviously.ai/) —
    which means that employees are in a position to add more value by adding AI to
    their skillset.
  prefs: []

- en: These intrapreneurs finding AI use-cases in their organizations don’t add to
    the number of open jobs on LinkedIn, but there are countless examples.

    potential to automate the repetitive, boring parts of their work, and focus on
    the creative, human-centered tasks. Not to mention, AI skills can boost your salary
    and career.'

- en: For example, marketers could use AI to predict customer behavior, build personas
    and identify top demographics. Retail employees could optimize assortments, predict
    inventory burn, forecast staffing needs, and more. Insurance employees could use
    AI to predict insurance claims, litigation risk, subrogation opportunities and
    more.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Entrepreneurship is the riskier flipside of intrapreneurship. It means going
    your own way, finding new ways to add value in the market, often without backing,
    support, or stability of any kind.

    on), and you’re one of the top engineers in your field. According to Holloway,
    you can expect [0.25%–0.5% equity](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation/sections/typical-employee-equity-levels).

- en: If you strike out on your own, as a solo founder, you have 100% equity to start.
    By bringing own co-founders, employees, and investors, that number will decrease,
    but there’s a lot more potential to be had.

- en: Learning AI is worth it, and always will be. Even if the job market gets saturated
    (which it isn’t yet, as there are still open jobs for those who are qualified),
    there’s always a potential for creative intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs. To stay
    relevant, AI skills are quickly becoming a must-have.
