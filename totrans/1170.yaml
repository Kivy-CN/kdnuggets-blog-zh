    and linear combinations (respectively Chapter 05, 06 and 07 of [Essential Math
    for Data Science](https://bit.ly/3oGHXyR)). This will allow you to convert data
    into systems of linear equations. At the end of this chapter (in [Essential Math

    of equations and linear algebra to solve a linear regression problem.
