    ones, too. Humans are still part of the process because they have to test the
    gene sequences identified as most promising by the machine learning algorithm.
    However, using this expedited method could be crucial in efficiently finding interventions

    in showing them how COVID-19 spreads. A graph database shows links between people,
    places or things. Scientists refer to each of those entities as a node, and the
    connections between them are the "edges." The results give a visual representation

    such as a flight number or even a car's license plate. The database would then
    tell those users whether anyone with a confirmed coronavirus case took those same
    trips and may have spread it to fellow passengers.
