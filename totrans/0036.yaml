    trends, responsibilities, qualifications, and salary expectations. Thus, I decided
    to take a look at the ad data of the so-called “[AI’s Hottest Job](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-05/ai-s-hottest-job-prompt-engineer)”
    with no speculations or presumptions. I collected 73 recently posted unique job
    ads data from popular on-line job posting platforms. Read about my data collection
    methodology and access the data set [here](https://github.com/ahmadi-analyst/prompt-eng-job-ads).
    While 73 may not be an ideal sample size, it''s a comprehensive starting point
    for our analysis. The initial revelation is sobering: there''s a scarcity of employers
    seeking "prompt engineers."'

    is "prompt engineer." However, other titles such as "IT Innovation Analyst," "Freelance
    ML/AI Engineer," "Data Scientist," and "AI Engineer" also emerge. I created word
    clouds for qualifications and responsibilities mentioned in the job descriptions.
    I don’t think word clouds are meant to reveal extraordinary insights, but they
    can represent a compact version of the important highlights in the text. As you
    see, in the job ads employers are talking about experience in computer science,
    model development, python, prompt design, machine learning, large language models,
    natural language processing, and artificial intelligence more than other stuff.

    “AI’s Hottest Job” is far from the reality, since the top demanded skills in the
    prompt engineering market are programming proficiency and NLP and LLMs experience.
    And they are not talking about micky mouse programming skills, they are looking
    for experts who are familiar with ML and AI frameworks. The employers are not
    just requiring “familiarity” with LLMs and coding, but, on average, they seek
    experts with 2-5 years of experience working with structured and unstructured
    data, coding, NLP, ML, and AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reading the top responsibilities make it more clear why this job title demands
    such a high level of programming and LLMs skills. Prompt engineering, as a professional
    job, is not sitting behind a computer and playing with Generative AI models to
    give you the right answer. It is about building business information systems that
    optimize inputs, integrate them seamlessly with other information systems and
    products, and deliver values to users and customers. In other words, businesses
    are not looking for someone who can chat with ChatGPT, they want to hire experts
    who can optimize GPT-like models and integrate them with their own products.

    educational backgrounds in computer science, math, analytics, engineering, physics,
    or linguistics. A bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field is
    commonly required, with more advanced degrees preferred or required for senior
    roles. The salaries are very different depending on the responsibilities and seniority.
    It can be as low as 30k and as high as half a million dollars per year. On average,
    the job ads with salary information pay between 90k and 195k a year.

    as a dream job have surfaced. As Ethan Mollick, the Wharton School professor,
    wrote in a [twitter post](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1627804798224580608)
    last year “prompt engineer is not a job of future” because “AI gets easier” and
    smarter in interpreting basic prompts. A month ago Coursera published a well-thought
    [career guide](https://www.coursera.org/articles/prompt-engineering-jobs) for
    prompt engineering (also see [this](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Skills-needed-to-become-a-prompt-engineer)).
    It seems the initial Gen AI [fad is slowly fading](/why-prompt-engineering-is-a-fad),
    and we are in a better position to understand AI’s current status and future trends.
    Don’t get me wrong. The quality of Gen AI outputs strongly depends on the inputs.
    Learning how to use and interact with these complex models is becoming an important
    skill for almost everyone. There are increasing number of scientific studies that
    suggest a systematic approach to prompting can significantly improve the outcome
    of these models (see [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14670),
    [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08769), [4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08721),
    [5](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491101.3519729?casa_token=DZRbqRwuGfoAAAAA:FDvB1bUOqHo0VXei8bOjYAW9YdwDg6Zx-EO3jW_hF80GEo2G3kcJvRjmfeYD4FYIIGxS8zwYrzbh),
    [6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10379), [7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14043)).
    However, “prompt engineering” is not (and it never was) a dream job that some
    people wanted it to be. Without significant experience in programming, natural
    language processing, machine learning, product development, and software integration
    no one is going to pay you a six-figure salary for just smooth-talking ChatGPT
    into a right answer.

    to be influenced by two important trends: first, as Ethan Mollick mentioned, Gen
    AI models are getting more adept at generating good outputs from unsophisticated
    simple prompt, perhaps similar to how Internet search engines have become better
    at returning more relevant results from simple search queries. Second, Gen AI
    models are being increasingly integrated into the business’s products, services,
    and platforms. This adaptation is crucial for the success of the AI economy. Therefore,
    knowing how to optimize, fine-tune, customize, and integrate Gen AI models with
    the current information systems and products is and will remain a valuable skill
    set. That’s why in the current prompt job ads, there is a huge demand for programmers,
    system designers, and those who can collaborate with other product development
    team members.'
