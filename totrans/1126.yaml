    skills to generate revenue and opportunities for their business. Knowledge of
    programming, machine learning, statistics, etc. is not enough to [get a data science
    job](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-get-a-data-science-job-the-ultimate-guide/).
    You also need a portfolio to showcase your data science skills. A well-rounded
    data science portfolio can show off all of your skills that make you eligible
    for that position. A well-explained data science portfolio should show off your
    ability to communicate, collaborate, reason about data, take the initiative, and [technical
    skills](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/most-in-demand-data-science-technical-skills/).

    what to add to your portfolio. In your data science portfolio, you need to have
    some projects on GitHub or your website or blog. Each project should be well structured,
    so a hiring manager can quickly evaluate your skills. In this blog, we will walk
    through a few data science project ideas that should be in your portfolio.
