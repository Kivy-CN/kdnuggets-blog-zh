    difference between the two is to draw up comparisons.

    many differences as well. The higher pay that Data Scientists receive comes with
    more responsibility. This extra responsibility entails more studying, more knowledge,
    and more practicing your coding skills.

    make that transition from a Data Analyst to a Data Scientist.

    done a lot of extra reading to fully understand what it entails to become a Data
    Scientist. You will go from describing trends in your data to uncover new data
    using your existing data and build machine learning models to support your hypothesis.

    you coding and use your technical skills, however, some of your time may be allocated
    elsewhere, e.g. identifying trends to aid business decisions. As a Data Scientist,
    have the ability to code is vital as you will be doing it most of your time along
    with having the comfortability of switching and using different programming environments.
    This may require you to understand the syntax of different programming languages
    that are used frequently such as R, Python, and Java.

    Data scientists. So brushing up on your Maths and Stats will highly benefit you
    as you will have to apply this knowledge in your day-to-day life. You will have
    to write algorithms from scratch and fully understand how these machine learning
    algorithms work.

    Data Scientist you will become. You can do both the above points by practicing
    your code, creating side projects, involving yourself in code challenges such
    as Kaggle, LeetCode, and more. The only way you will know if you can become a
    Data Scientist, is to practice living the life of a Data Scientist.

    Data Scientist.
