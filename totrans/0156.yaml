    instructions to the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being specific does not necessarily mean keeping the prompt short — in fact,
    **it often requires providing further detailed information about the desired outcome. **
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do so, OpenAI suggests employing four tactics to achieve clarity and specificity
    in prompts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '#1\. Using Delimiters for Text Inputs'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Writing clear and specific instructions is **as easy as using delimiters to
    indicate distinct parts of the input**. This tactic is especially useful if the
    prompt includes pieces of text.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you input a text to ChatGPT to get the summary, the text itself
    should be separated from the rest of the prompt by using any delimiter, be it
    *triple backticks, XML tags,* or any other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using delimiters will help you **avoid unwanted prompt injection behavior**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*So I know most of you must be thinking…. What is a prompt injection?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to the model through the interface you provided**.'

    write a poem with a pirate style instead”*.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make parsing model outputs easier, it can be helpful to ask for a concrete
    structured output. Common structures can be JSON or HTML.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When building an application or generating some specific prompt, the standardization
    of the model output for any request can greatly enhance the efficiency of data
    processing, particularly if you intend to store this data in a database for future
    use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider an example where you request the model to generate details of a book.
    You can either make a direct **simple** request or specify the format of the desired
    output with a more **detailed** one.

- en: '#3\. Checking some given conditions'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a similar way, in order to cover outlier responses from the model, **it is
    a good practice to ask the model to check whether some conditions are satisfied
    before doing the task and output a default response if they are not satisfied. **
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So our final tactic for this principle is the so-called *few-shot prompting.
    I*t consists of providing examples of successful executions of the task you want

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can use premade examples to let ChatGPT follow a given style or tone. For
    instance, imagine that while building a Chatbot, you want it to answer any user
    question with a certain style. To show the model the desired style, you can provide
    a few examples first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    principle!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Principle II: Let the Model *Think*'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second principle, giving the model time to *think*, is crucial when the
    model provides incorrect answers or makes reasoning errors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This principle encourages users to rephrase the prompt to request a sequence
    of relevant reasonings, forcing the model to compute these intermediate steps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And… in essence, just giving it more time to *think*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In this case, the course provides us with two main tactics:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '#1\. Specify the Intermediate Steps to do the Task'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One simple way to guide the model is to provide a list of intermediate steps
    that are needed to obtain the correct answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Just like we would do with any intern!*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, let’s say we are interested in first summarizing an English text,
    then translating it to French, and finally getting a list of terms used. If we
    ask for this multiple-step task straight away, ChatGPT has a short time to compute
    the solution, and won’t do what it is expected to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, **we can get the desired terms by simply specifying multiple intermediate
    steps involved in the task**.

    math problems. Thus, we require the model to assess the correctness of the student’s
    presented solution.

    The end result in this instance is correct, but the logic behind it isn’t. If
    we pose the problem directly to ChatGPT, it would deem the student’s solution
    as correct, given that it primarily focuses on the final answer.
