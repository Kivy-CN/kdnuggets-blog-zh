- en: I started playing around with Chat GPT a few weeks ago. I was blown away. Immediately,
    I had to build something using this tool. I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime
    golden opportunity to get into something at the exact right moment.

- en: I wanted it to be something that everyone in the world could use. My past projects
    (not in AI) were niche use cases in small local areas, and I wanted to build something
    more significant than that. The biggest thing I learned from all my entrepreneur
    endeavors is to, going forward, build something with a massive potential market.
    Too often I built something cool that only relatively few people would ever need
    to use.
  prefs: []

- en: So I googled world trending topics on Google trends. Immediately, and quite
    luckily, I found the keyword “cover letter” to be extremely trendy at that moment.
    And it was an “aha” moment because I, too, had a pain point in cover letters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Either I hated doing cover letters and labored through them for jobs I really
    wanted or simply skipped applying to the jobs that required cover letters that
    I wasn’t that interested in anyway.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so, I decided to create an AI cover letter generator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make it different from any cover letter generator out there (which existed
    before AI), I realized I needed a key feature no one else had. And then it dawned
    it me that most cover letter generators simply ask for *your* skills. What if
    my cover letter generator asked for your skills *and* the skills required in the
    job description?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the result, I set out to create a cover letter generator that asked you to
    paste your resume and job description into separate forms and mix them up into
    a cool cover letter. It would take the text of both your cover letter and the
    job description and write you a unique cover letter based on the skills and experience
    required in the job description relative to the skills and experience listed on
    your resume. Magic!

- en: I’m a novice coder, but I was experienced (as much as possible at this point
    in time) at making neat prompts on ChatGPT so I knew I could do it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I fiddled with the Open AI playground, experimenting with my prompts over
    two days until I found what I thought was the best results for a cover letter
    made from my resume and a job description for a job I actually wanted that I found
    online. I would say I tried about 1000 different prompts, with many unique mixtures
    of max tokens, temperature and penalties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, to create my application, I needed to learn how to code a website that
    did everything the Open AI playground did for me but in a much more user-friendly
    manner. Most importantly, I needed to have separate form boxes for the resume
    and job description, unlike the Open AI playground, which only has one form box.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so, I watched a few YouTube videos on creating “ad copy” AI generators (which
    is analogous in a way to cover letter generators) and learned overnight to make
    my app on bubble.io. All I had to do as the final step was connect the Open AI
    API to my output form on my new website.

    Tally.Work ([link](https://tally.work/)). Check it out!

- en: In the end, it turned out pretty well. Some people even seemed to think it was
    cool on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34621532). Right now
    I am getting thousands of users on just the first day and I’ve actually spent
    about $100 on Open AI tokens (which is a problem for another day).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I realize that the cover letters generated on my app do look like an AI wrote
    them. But that’s ok. AI (at least my prompts) is not there yet. But one day, in
    the not too distant future it will be. Until then, my tool could be a place to
    start a first draft of a cover letter. Users could use my tool to get started
    and then edit and add to the cover letter to make it sound more human.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also dawned on me that AI is going to all but remove from existence make-work
    and busybody tasks like this. That's good, right? Right?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do hope that this project winds down because, as I mentioned, I’m not too
    fond of cover letters, and if this project (or others like it) succeeds, then
    employers will stop asking for cover letters, and the app will become useless.
    As I mentioned, I hate cover letters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I do hope happens from this project is that I learn a lot from this experience
    so I can build a more interesting AI app that I will hope does *not* fail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My advice if you are looking to build your own AI app is to just get started.
    Use the [Open AI playground](https://openai.com/api/) where no code is required
    and then build your frontend either with code if you know how or with no code
    on a no code builder like [bubble.io](https://bubble.io/). There are tons of YouTube
    videos on all this, so why not start today?
