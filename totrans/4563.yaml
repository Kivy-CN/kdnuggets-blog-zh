- en: Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer
    groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful
    means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can
    then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and
    services.

    sum of distances of observations from their cluster centroids which is given by

- en: K means clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms and usually
    the first thing practitioners apply when solving clustering tasks to get an idea
    of the structure of the dataset. The goal of K means is to group data points into
    distinct non-overlapping subgroups. One of the major application of K means clustering
    is segmentation of customers to get a better understanding of them which in turn
    could be used to increase the revenue of the company.
