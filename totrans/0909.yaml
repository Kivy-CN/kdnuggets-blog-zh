- en: I can remember the joy and excitement that I had when I began my data science
    journey some 6 years ago. For me, the transition to data science was pretty smooth
    because of my strong background in advanced mathematics and computational physics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, as I got further and further into my data science journey, I realized
    that I was not making a lot of progress in terms of learning advanced concepts.
    I got caught up with learning just the basic concepts. Instead of applying the
    basic knowledge I already had to real-world data science projects, I kept taking
    all these different data science courses and data science specializations on platforms
    such as DataCamp, Udemy, YouTube, edX, and Coursera.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At one point, it almost became like an addiction to me, as I was constantly
    searching for data science courses to enroll in, especially the ones that were
    free of charge. Most of the courses taught on these platforms covered fundamental
    concepts only, as advanced concepts are introduced, but most often superficially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reflecting on my data science journey, if I were to do it again, I would place
    more emphasis on project-based learning. In my opinion, project-based learning
    is the most reliable way of learning data science, because it gives you the opportunity
    to learn as you go. It also helps you to apply your knowledge to real-world data
    science projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it’s exciting to acquire as much fundamental knowledge as possible, the
    focus should be to make gradual progress from fundamental concepts to more advanced
    concepts. Beginner in the field of data science must continue to make quantum
    leaps in their knowledge as they transition from beginner-level to advanced-level
    data science professionals.
