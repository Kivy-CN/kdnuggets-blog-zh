- en: I started my data science journey back in 2016\. At that time, machine learning
    boot camps were much popular. The only requirement of the course was basic Python
    knowledge. I felt so happy because I used to play with Python codes at that time,
    so I opted for the course.

- en: The usual practice of human beings — when we’re learning something new — is
    to try and collect as much material from different places. We may think that these
    resources will help us learn more. And, the more variety of materials you have,
    the more choice you can have to select the right resource. But, this is wrong.

- en: 'Most of the resources I collected back in 2016 are still in my D: drive, and
    I haven’t watched them yet. But, yes, there is one course that I covered 70% of,
    which was the machine learning boot camp course. And the reason I finished that
    course was — the course was easy to follow and everything was simple and straightforward.'

- en: When we are in the machine learning area, we may have the fantasy to build a
    model without knowing the ideas behind the algorithms. And that Bootcamp course
    primarily focused on the implementation part and not on the concept part, and
    that’s where I made the big mistake. I was in the false hope of learning machine
    learning.

    results. It’s more of the knowledge behind the algorithms that helps us select
    the correct algorithm for our data to get a better outcome.

- en: The self-paced courses provide us with passive learning, which is not suitable
    for machine learning. Here, you can find a neural network with different layers,
    activation functions, back prop, forward pass, and many more things that a single
    person can’t cover in that self-paced course. And nobody will share those tricks
    in the self-paced course — usually, those are free or much cheaper.

- en: I was like everyone else, trusting the self-paced courses of machine learning
    where everything is done by another person. Here I am sitting, just watching the
    video tutorial to build a complete machine learning model without trying even
    a single line of code myself. Then, getting the false hope of learning machine
    learning by just covering those videos.

- en: I am not against self-paced courses. It depends on the area of learning. A self-paced
    course for learning guitar might be a good one to practice because we only need
    a guitar in hand to try it out.

- en: After three years of trying self-paced courses from different resources, I found
    that I cannot even decide the best suitable algorithms for specific problems.
    I wasn’t aware of the simple modeling process. All I was aware of was importing
    certain libraries and passing data to get the output of regression and classification
    problems. But, how to interpret those outputs, I had no clue.

- en: Finally, one day, one of my colleagues suggested joining an institute where
    industry experts would teach us. That day I was like, it is just a waste of money
    because they were charging ten times more than those self-paced courses.

- en: Anyhow, I joined the online live classes and observed the change. That active
    learning through live classes gave me a boost. The step-by-step process of building
    a neural network gave me another boost. And the main benefit was the daily assignment
    given to us.

    instructor to clear up any doubts; work on real-time industry scenarios, enjoy
    professional-quality content, and I was required, which we can’t get from a self-paced
    course.'

- en: Most of the freely available courses on the internet are not well structured,
    and that’s the secret of machine learning. There is a step-by-step process to
    build any model. First, we have to learn about the algorithms, get the data, clean
    the data, find the best features, split the data, train the model, validate the
    model, and then do inferencing. We can’t miss any single step if we want better
    results.

    expert to know the proper flow of machine learning modeling. Otherwise, you will
    keep trying many free resources without understanding the adequate flow for modeling
    — so, they are of no use.
