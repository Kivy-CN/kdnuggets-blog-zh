- en: Building LLM-based applications can undoubtedly provide valuable solutions for
    several problems. However, understanding and proactively addressing challenges
    such as hallucinations, prompt context, reliability, prompt engineering, and security
    will be instrumental in harnessing the true potential of LLMs while ensuring optimal
    performance and user satisfaction. In this article, we will explore these five
    crucial considerations that developers and practitioners should know when building
    LLM applications.

    In the context of LLMs, hallucinations refer to generating unreal, incorrect,
    nonsensical information. LLMs are very creative and they can be used and tuned
    for different domains but a very critical unsolved problem that still exists is
    their hallucinations. Since the LLMs are not search engines or databases, therefore
    these mistakes are unavoidable.

    details and constraints for the input prompt to limit the model's freedom to hallucinate.

- en: As mentioned one of the solutions to the hallucinations problem is providing
    the proper context to the input prompt to limit the LLM's freedom to hallucinate.
    However, on the other hand, LLMs have a limit on the number of words that can
    be used. One possible solution for this problem is using indexing in which the
    data is turned into vectors and stored in a database and the appropriate content
    is searched during runtime. Indexing usually works however it is complex to implement.

- en: One of the problems you will face if you build an application based on LLM is
    reliability and consistency. LLMs are not reliable and consistent to make sure
    that the model output will be right or as expected every time. You can build a
    demo of an application and run it multiple times and when you lunch your application
    you will find that the output might not be consistent which will cause a lot of
    problems for your users and customers.

- en: The best way to communicate with a computer is through a programming or machine
    language, not a natural language. We need an unambiguous so that the computer
    will understand our requirements. The problem with LLMs is that if you asked LLM
    to do a specific thing with the same prompt ten times you might get ten different
    outputs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another problem you will face when building an application based on LLMs is
    prompt injection. In this case, users will enforce the LLMs to give a certain
    output that isn’t expected. For example, if you created an application to generate
    a youtube script video if you provide a title. A user can instruct to forget everything
    and write a story.

    and automate a lot of tasks. However, it comes with some issues that you take
    care of when building LLMs-based applications. Beginning from hallucinations,
    choosing the right prompt context to overcome the hallucinations and output reliability
    and consistency and the security concerns with prompt injection.
