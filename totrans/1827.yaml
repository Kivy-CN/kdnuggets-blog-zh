    scientists. Many companies provide data and prize money to set up data science
    competitions on Kaggle. Recently I had my first shot on Kaggle and **ranked 98th
    (~ 5%) among 2125 teams**. Being my Kaggle debut, I feel quite satisfied with
    the result. Since many Kaggle beginners set 10% as their first goal, I want to
    share my two cents on how to achieve that.'

    after which you cannot merge teams or enter the competition. Therefore **be sure
    to have at least one valid submission before that.**

    referred to as a **Public LB** score. Whereas the final result will use the remaining
    data in the testing set, which is referred to as a **Private LB** score.

    Generally speaking, CV scores are more reliable than LB scores.

    can get enough intuition from visualization, but quantitative results are always
    good to have. Note that we will always encounter non-i.i.d. data in real world.
    So we have to be careful about which test to use and how we interpret the findings.

- en: In many competitions public LB scores are not very consistent with local CV
    scores due to noise or non-i.i.d. distribution. You can use test results to **roughly
    set a threshold for determining whether an increase of score is due to genuine
    improvment or randomness**.

- en: How we choose to perform preprocessing largely depends on what we learn about
    the data in the previous stage. In practice, I recommend using **[Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)** for
    data manipulation and mastering usage of frequently used Pandas operations. The
    advantage is that you get to see the results immediately and are able to modify
    or rerun code blocks. This also makes it very convenient to share your approach
    with others. After all[reproducible results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) are
    very important in data science.
