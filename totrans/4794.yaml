    that might be your new best friend if you have a lot of data and/or you’re after
    the state-of-the-art in AI: [deep learning](https://github.com/kozyrkov/deep-learning-walkthrough).
    Neural networks. Big ones. It’s not a data science Swiss Army Knife, it’s the [industrial
    lathe](http://www.industrytap.com/worlds-largest-lathe-sale/14280)… which means
    you can probably stop reading if all you want to do is put a regression line through

    for new planets](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/video/nasa-s-kepler-telescope-discovered-a-new-exoplanet-with-google-s-help-1121785923978),
    prevent blindness by helping doctors [screen for diabetic retinopathy](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/googles-ai-reads-retinas-prevent-blindness-diabetics/),
    and help save forests by alerting authorities to signs of [illegal deforestation
    activity](https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/fight-against-illegal-deforestation-tensorflow/).
    It’s what [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFr3K2DORc8) and [Google Cloud
    Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) are built on top of and it’s yours to
    play with. TensorFlow is open source, you can [download it for free](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [get
    started](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tensorflow-tutorial) immediately.

    system the only other system we know of that has eight planets in orbit around
    a single star. No system has been found with more than eight planets, so I guess
    that means we’re tied with Kepler-90 for first place (for now). Learn more [here](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/video/nasa-s-kepler-telescope-discovered-a-new-exoplanet-with-google-s-help-1121785923978).
