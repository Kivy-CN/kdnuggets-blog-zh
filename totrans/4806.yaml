- en: The field of statistics is often misunderstood, but it plays an essential role
    in our everyday lives. Statistics, done correctly, allows us to extract knowledge
    from the vague, complex, and difficult real world. Wielded incorrectly, statistics
    can be used to harm and mislead. A clear understanding of statistics and the meanings
    of various statistical measures is important to distinguishing between truth and
    misdirection.

    items. If we have **outliers** in our data, items that are much higher or lower
    than the other values, it can have an adverse effect on the mean. That is to say,
    the mean is not **robust** to outliers. The median, not having to look at outliers,

    events or errors in our data collection, so it's important to be able to recognize

    of many ways to detect the presence of outliers, though visualization is usually

    mode is defined as the value that appears the most frequently in our data. The
    intuition of the mode as the "middle" is not as immediate as mean or median, but
    there is a clear rationale. If a value appears repeatedly throughout the data,
    we also know it will influence the average towards the modal value. The more a
    value appears, the more it will influence the mean. Thus, a mode represents the
    highest weighted contributing factor to our mean.

    much does my data vary?" There are few things in the world that stay the same
    everytime we observe it. We all know someone who has lamented a slight change
    in body weight that is due to natural fluctuation rather than outright weight
    gain. This variability makes the world fuzzy and uncertain, so it's useful to
    have metrics that summarize this "fuzziness."

    context of your data*. Our median price was $24, and our range is $2296\. The
    range is two orders of magnitude higher than our median, so it suggests that our
    data is extremely spread out. Perhaps if we had another wine data set, we could
    compare the ranges of these two data sets to gain an understanding on how they
    differ. Otherwise, the range alone isn't super helpful.

    but is a statement of *how much* your data deviates from a typical data point.

    the mean. This relationship to the mean is apparent in standard deviation's calculation.

    calculated by summing up all of your observations and dividing it by the number
    of observations. The standard deviation equation is similar but seeks to calculate
    the average *deviation* from the mean, in addition to an extra square root operation.

    of this article.

    prices and scores, so we'll create a dedicated function for this. Calculating
    a cumulative sum of numbers is cumbersome by hand, but Python's `for` loops make
    this trivial. We are making our own function to demonstrate that Python makes
    it easy to perform these statistics, but it's also good to know that the `numpy` library
    also implements standard deviation under `std`.

    that the standard deviation would be small. In contrast, the prices with its outliers
    produces a much higher value. The larger the standard deviation, the *more* spread
    out the data is around the mean and vice-versa.

- en: Variance and standard deviation are almost the exact same thing! Variance is
    just the square of the standard deviation. Likewise, variance and standard deviation
    represent the same thing — a measure of spread — but it's worth noting that the
    units are different. Whatever units your data are in, standard deviation will
    be the same, and variation will be in that units-squared.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A question that many statistics starters ask is, *"But why do we square the
    deviation? Won't the absolute value get rid of pesky negatives in the sum?"* While
    avoiding negative values in the sum is a reason for the squaring operation, it's
    not the only one. Like the mean, variance and standard deviation are affected
    by outliers. Many times, outliers are also points of interest in our data set,
    so squaring the difference from the mean allows us to point out this significance.
    If your are familiar with calculus, you'll see that having an exponential term
    allows us to find our where the point of minimum deviation is.

    and standard deviation, but the variance still has significance in other academic
