- en: Last year I wrote [an overview post](/2016/03/data-science-puzzle-explained.html)
    which defines a number of key concepts related to data science -- including data
    science itself -- and attempts to explain how these pieces fit together into a
    so-called "data science puzzle." As a new year begins, and a previous year worth
    of advances, insights, and accomplishments get rolled into our collective professional
    outlook, I thought it would be prudent to revisit this puzzle, noting and incorporating
    any changes and updates which may contribute to rearranging the puzzle for the
    foreseeable future, and to provide some addition commentary where warranted.

  zh: 去年我写了一篇[概述文章](/2016/03/data-science-puzzle-explained.html)，定义了与数据科学相关的一些关键概念——包括数据科学本身——并尝试解释这些部分如何组成一个所谓的“数据科学难题”。随着新年的到来，以及前一年所有的进展、见解和成就融入到我们的集体职业展望中，我认为重新审视这个难题是明智的，注意并整合可能导致难题重组的任何变化和更新，并在适当的地方提供一些额外的评论。
