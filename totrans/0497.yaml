- en: My passion for data science started about two and half years ago. I was working
    at a job that has nothing to do with data science. It was a big challenge for
    me to make a career change because I had a lot to learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After two years full of learning and dedication, I was able to land my first
    job as a data scientist. My learning journey, of course, did not stop. I learn
    a ton of new things while I do my job as a data scientist.
  prefs: []

- en: The learning part does not change. However, what and how I learn changed dramatically.
    In this article, I would like elaborate on these changes. If you are working your
    way through becoming a data scientist, you might experience the same.

    Data science is still evolving and you need to keep yourself fresh all the time.
    I think data science is not a mature field yet so new techniques and concepts
    are being introduced frequently.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most noticeable change for me was the size of data. When I was studying
    on my own, I was practicing with datasets that have at most 100 thousand rows.
    I consider it as a small dataset now. The size of data depends on the field and
    problem you are working on. In general, 10 million rows are not much for a real
    life problem.

    learn new tools that can handle such datasets. Pandas was more than enough for
    me before I started working as a data scientist. However, it is not an efficient
    tool with large-scale data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tools that allow for distributed computing are more preferred. Spark is
    one of the most popular ones. It is an analytics engine used for large-scale data
    processing. Spark lets you spread both data and computations over clusters to
    achieve a substantial performance increase.
  prefs: []

    API for Spark. It combines the simplicity of Python with the efficiency of Spark.

    studying, I did everything in my computer (i.e. work locally). It was enough for
    practicing and studying.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, it is highly unlikely that a company operates locally. Most companies
    work in the cloud. The data is stored in the cloud, computations are done in the
    cloud, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to do your job efficiently, it is very important to obtain a comprehensive
    understanding of cloud tools and services. There are various cloud providers but
    the key players are AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform. I had to learn how to use
    their services and manage data stored in the cloud.

    I learned the basic git commands when I was studying. However, it is different
    when working in a production environment. Git is a version control system. It
    maintains a history of all changes made to the code.
  prefs: []

    as a team. Thus, even if you work in a small startup, git is a must-have skill.
    Projects are developed and maintained with git.
  prefs: []

    you get used to it after working on a few projects.

- en: Tools are not the only things that change in my learning journey. How I approach
    the data also changed. When you work on a ready-to-use dataset, there is not much
    you can do in terms of cleaning and processing the data. For instance, in case
    of a machine learning task, you can apply a model after a few simple steps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The case will be different in your job. A substantial part of a project is spent
    on getting the data ready. I do not mean just cleaning the raw data. It is an
    important step too. However, exploring the underlying structure within the data
    and understanding the relationships among features are of crucial importance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are working on a new problem, it will be your job to define data requirements
    as well. It is another challenge that requires a special set of skills. Domain
    knowledge is an essential part of it.
  prefs: []

- en: Feature engineering is much more important than hyperparameter tuning of a machine
    learning model. What you can achieve with hyperparameter tuning is limited so
    you can improve the performance to a certain extent. On the other hand, an informative
    feature has the potential to improve a model substantially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before I started working as a data scientist, I focused on understanding the
    machine learning algorithms and how to tune a model. I now spend most of my time
    getting the data ready.

    your skills in any building block of data science. However, these resources cannot
    offer a real job experience. There is nothing wrong with it. Just make yourself
    ready to learn a different set of materials when you land your first job.
