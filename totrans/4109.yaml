    software developer who has dedicated much of his time to teaching people how to
    code. Invent With Python provides you with a host of resources (mostly in an eBook
    form) to help you start coding with Python. However, it’s the website’s set of
    [Gently Explained Python Programming Exercises](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/)

    but through action; you must work with the programming language to truly learn
    it. Invent With Python’s Gently Explained Python Programming Exercises are intended
    for beginner and intermediate-level programmers. It features concise and simple
    explanations of each problem in the exercise to help nurture you into the next
    level of Python proficiency.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As any craftsman would vouch, you’re only as good as the tools you use. While
    you can use Python’s default IDE (IDLE) or a text editor like VS code, a fully-featured
    IDE like Visual Studio 2022 is more conducive to building advanced Python applications.
    Microsoft Visual Studio is regarded as one of the best (if not the greatest) IDEs.
    You can easily manage your dependencies and libraries using its pip and Pypl built-in
    support.
  prefs: []

    to deploy a simple machine learning protocol. With Visual Studio’s arsenal of
    code-editing tools, this time could be cut down considerably. Visual Studio features
    tooltips, templates, autocompletes, and code snippets, making it easier to work
    with and manage your data sources.

    features extensive testing tools. You can debug, deploy and maintain remote test
    environments, set the machine architecture, and keep track of everything using
    the Test Explorer.

    languages. All you have to do is download the necessary workloads for each language.
    Visual Studio’s [Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
    is free and should be enough for most programmers. However, if you want access
    to even more features, you can always download the Professional or Enterprise
    edition.

    media, though. Programming-related video content can also be found on Dailymotion,
    Vimeo, Facebook, etc. Some websites and services prefer to self-host their media,
    so keeping track of the best content can be difficult.

    by a video, various written instructions, examples, and some code you can run
    yourself using the Programiz online compiler. However, if you are unsatisfied
    with the course’s structure, [Programiz provides a set of tabs](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming)
    that allow you to view the examples, references, and compilers on your own. Many
    find the compiler the most useful as you can quickly run and test code from it.
