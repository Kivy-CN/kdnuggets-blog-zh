    it won’t help. At some point,the model’s accuracy has to be improved. That’s when
    it hits that understanding and exploring a data set is critically important.

    system, it’s vital to be familiar with the dataset, know feature distributions,
    identify important and unimportant features, discover trends and relationships
    among the features and so on. Don’t jump into modelling before digging into the
    data.Remember that the quality of the output depends on the quality of input.Garbage

    into modelling, because understanding, generating and selecting useful features
    impacts model performance. It helps the data scientists to check assumptions required
    for fitting models.In addition to understanding the input data set, it’s also
    important to understand the data generated throughout the model building process—e.g.
    different exploration and visualization techniques can be used on the activation
    data of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs).

    can be challenging. It’s impossible to understand the data set and make conclusions
    just looking at the first or randomly selected 100 observations from millions
    of them. Don’t expect to plot statistics for each feature if the data has thousands
    of variables. It’s better to have a handful of features or a way to summarize
    them. And remember that each variable can’t be treated in a similar way if the
    data has heterogeneous variables.

    techniques to get a better understanding. This includes summarizing main data
    set characteristics, finding representative or critical points and discovering
    relevant features. After gaining an overall understanding of the data set, you
    can think about which observations and features to use in modeling.

    Subspace representation is a solution to that problem. Using the prototype and

    differences between clusters for many applications such as differential diagnosis.
    For that, find distinguishing dimensions in the data. A mind the gap model (MGM)
    combines extractive and selective approaches and reports a global set of distinguishable
    dimensions to assist with further exploration.
