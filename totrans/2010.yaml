    companies that use insights from big data experience an average increase in revenue
    of around 44% - recognizing customer needs that need attention and serving them
    at just the right time. Businesses bought into the data claims and started collecting
    data, yet business users find it difficult to find, use, and customize the data
    they want when they need it. Data and insights can transform organisational outcomes
    only when meaningful data is made available to every data consumer (internal and
    external)

    they still, struggle to manage the data coming from varied sources without standardization
    and governance. Thus, this creates unused and invaluable data silos (called data
    gaps).

    to anyone as and when required for a particular function. Businesses can align
    their objectives with the help of insights from data products. In simple terms,
    [treating data as a product means](https://www.k2view.com/what-is-a-data-product/)

    decentralized data management and governance. It is a domain-driven data architecture
    that requires product thinking for collecting data for each domain where each
    stakeholder of data is the owner of their data to provide clean, valid, and reliable
    data products. Thus, every stakeholder or team within an organization adopts product
    thinking and views data as a product where the ownership lies beyond their department
    to make data accessible, clean and adequate for every consumer (anyone who requires
    data for any purpose or development) within an organization.

    and trustworthy. In treating data-as-a-product, the accountability of each domain
    ensures that there is contextual knowledge and required information in their managed

    preparing its data and making it accessible to others as well for consumption.
    Metadata provides data context to consumers to speed up data discovery and access.'

    which provides the deployment, management, and monitoring of data products and
    aligns with the contemporary "data-as-a-product concept. By keeping metadata for
    each data product, the data product studio assists data owners in aggregating
    and managing data for all business entities (such as a customer, product, location,
    or any transaction) and further prepares this data for consumers in the form of
    an integrated data product. To reach enterprise-grade scalability, robustness,
    and agility, the platform maintains and provides each dataset as a micro-database
    in an original manner. This can help enterprises unlock the potential of data-driven
    insights by transforming the relationship between the inflowing data and its consumers.

    requiring more people and tools for management has proven to be limited in achieving
    business outcomes. Thus, the data mesh architecture treats data-as-a-product as
    the new way to empower each domain to unravel insights from data. Data as a product
    approach brings an agile way of managing data at every level of an enterprise
    and makes data more accessible to all stakeholders.
