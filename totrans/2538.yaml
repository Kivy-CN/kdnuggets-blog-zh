- en: '**[An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/)**,
    written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani,
    is an absolute classic in the space. The book, a staple of statistical learning
    texts, is accessible to readers of all levels, and can be read without much of
    an existing foundational knowledge in the area.'

- en: As the scale and scope of data collection continue to increase across virtually
    all fields, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who
    wishes to understand data. An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides a
    broad and less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. Each
    chapter includes an R lab. This book is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use
    contemporary tools for data analysis.

- en: An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R (ISLR) can be
    considered a less advanced treatment of the topics found in another classic of
    the genre written by some of the same authors, [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/05/elements-statistical-learning-free-ebook.html).
    Another major difference between these 2 titles, beyond the level of depth of
    the material covered, is that ISLR introduces these topics alongside practical
    implementations in a programming language, in this case R.

    need to take my word for how essential of a text it is. Here''s a review (taken
    from the book''s Amazon site) by Larry Wasserman of Carnegie Mellon University:'

- en: '"An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL)" by James, Witten, Hastie and
    Tibshirani is the "how to'''' manual for statistical learning. Inspired by "The
    Elements of Statistical Learning'''' (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman), this book
    provides clear and intuitive guidance on how to implement cutting edge statistical
    and machine learning methods. ISL makes modern methods accessible to a wide audience
    without requiring a background in Statistics or Computer Science. The authors
    give precise, practical explanations of what methods are available, and when to
    use them, including explicit R code. Anyone who wants to intelligently analyze
    complex data should own this book."'
