    defining and comparing these related terms, the fact is that much of this terminology
    is fluid, is not entirely agreed-upon, and, frankly, being exposed to other peoples'
    views is one of the best ways to test and refine your own.

- en: So, while one may not agree entirely (or even minimally) with my opinion on
    much of this terminology, there may still be something one can get out of this.
    Several concepts central to data science will be examined. Or, at least, central
    *in my opinion*. I will do my best to put forth how they relate to one another
    and how they fit together as individual pieces of a larger puzzle.

- en: As an example of somewhat divergent opinions, and prior to considering any of
    the concepts individually, KDnuggets' Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro has put together
    the following Venn diagram which outlines the relationship between the very same
    data science terminology we will be considering herein. The reader is encouraged
    to compare this Venn diagram with Drew Conway's now famous [data science Venn
    diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), as
    well as my own discussion below and modified process/relationship diagram near
    the bottom of the post. I think that, while differences exist, the concepts line
    up with some degree of similarity (see the previous few paragraphs).

- en: There are all sorts of articles available defining big data, and I won't spend
    much time on this concept here. I will simply state that big data could very generally
    be defined as datasets of a size "[beyond the ability of commonly used software
    tools to capture, manage, and process](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Cloud-Computing-Foundations-Applications-ebook/dp/B00CMQJZWE)."
    Big data is a moving target; this definition is both vague and accurate enough
    to capture its central characteristic.

  zh: 有各种各样的文章定义大数据，我在这里不会花太多时间讨论这个概念。我将简单地说明，大数据可以非常笼统地定义为“[超出常用软件工具捕获、管理和处理能力的 数据集](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Cloud-Computing-Foundations-Applications-ebook/dp/B00CMQJZWE)”。大数据是一个不断变化的目标；这个定义虽然模糊，但足够准确以捕捉其核心特征。

    understanding of their search term popularities and N-gram frequencies, in order

- en: According to [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) in his [seminal book
    on the subject](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html),
    machine learning is "concerned with the question of how to construct computer
    programs that automatically improve with experience." Machine learning is interdisciplinary
    in nature, and employs techniques from the fields of computer science, statistics,
    and artificial intelligence, among others. The main artifacts of machine learning
    research are algorithms which facilitate this automatic improvement from experience,
    algorithms which can be applied in a variety of diverse fields.

- en: I don't think there is anyone who would doubt that machine learning is a central
    aspect of data science. I give the term *data science* detailed treatment below,
    but if you consider that at a very high level its goal is to extract insight from
    data, machine learning is the engine which allows this process to be automated.
    Machine learning has a lot in common with classical statistics, in that it uses
    samples to infer and make generalizations. Where statistics has more of a focus
    on the descriptive (though it *can*, by extrapolation, be predictive), machine
    learning has very little concern with the descriptive, and employs it only as
    an intermediate step in order to be able to make predictions. Machine learning
    is often thought to be synonymous with pattern recognition; while that really
    won't get much disagreement from me, I believe that the term *pattern recognition*
    implies a much less sophisticated and more simplistic set of processes than machine
    learning actually is, which is why I tend to shy away from it.
