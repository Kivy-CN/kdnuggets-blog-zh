- en: As interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Machine Learning
    (ML), grows and more engineers enter this popular field, the lack of de facto
    standards and frameworks for how work should be done is becoming more apparent.
    A new focus on optimizing the ML delivery pipeline is starting to gain momentum.

    and it is a non-trivial task ensuring that their work survives the delivery process.
    Of course, this isn’t a new problem: in the past, traditional software development
    teams would throw their work “over the wall” to the operations team to serve in
    production with little to no context. A community effort to solve the inevitable
    mess resulted in what we now think of as DevOps, removing the wall between development
    and operations to drive increased efficiency and improve product quality. New
    tools and processes to help teams implement streamlined delivery pipelines now
    help guarantee development/production parity.'

    worse as demand for AI products continues to grow. There is a new wall that is
    killing productivity. How does DevOps change with the rise of data science teams
    in engineering organizations? The pain points we are seeing in the community today

    downstream advantages in the development lifecycle in terms of easy vertical and
    horizontal scalability for running workloads on large datasets, as well as ease
    of deployment and delivery of models and prediction engines. Docker images running
    in containers provide an easy way to guarantee a consistent runtime environment
    across different developer laptops, remote compute clusters, and in production
    environments.

    and disciplined system-level configuration management, containers still provide
    a significant advantage in terms of spin up/down time for new environments and
    developer productivity. However, what we have heard repeatedly from the data science
    community is: I know Docker will make this easier, but I don’t have the time or
    resources to set it up and figure it all out.'

- en: The Torus 1.0 package contains a Dockerized Cookiecutter for Data Science (a
    fork of the popular cookiecutter-data-science) and an ML Development Base Docker
    Image. Using the project cookiecutter and Docker image together, you can go from
    cold-steel to a new project working in a Jupyter Notebook with all of the common
    libraries available in under five minutes (and you didn’t have to pip install
    anything).

    Docker Hub. This includes many of the commonly used data science and ML libraries
    pre-installed, along with a Jupyter Notebook server with useful extensions installed
    and configured.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your top-level project directory as a shared volume on the container. This lets
    you use your preferred IDE on your host machine to modify code and see changes
    reflected immediately in the runtime environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Port forwarding is set up so you can use a browser on your host machine
    to work with the notebook server running inside the container. An appropriate
    host port to forward is dynamically chosen, so no worries about port conflicts
    (e.g., other notebook servers, databases, or anything else running on your laptop).
  prefs: []

- en: 4\. The project is scaffolded with its own Dockerfile, so you can install any
    project-specific packages or libraries and share your environment with the team
    via source control.

- en: You can use your favorite browser and IDE locally as you normally would to do
    your work, while your runtime environment is 100% consistent across your team.
    If you are working on multiple projects on your machine, rest assured that each
    project is running in its own cleanly isolated container.

    easy to forget that, before even considering a higher-order platform or framework,
    you need to make sure your team is set up for success. We need what the DevOps
    movement did for software engineering in the ML delivery pipeline. Moving to a
    Docker-first development workflow is a great first step in making life easier
    for everyone involved with the delivery pipeline—and that includes your customers.
