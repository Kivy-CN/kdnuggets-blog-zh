    powered by [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform).
    We discussed the web scraping phase used to collect live data regarding the data
    analytics job market, followed by the process of cleaning up the data using NLP
    techniques. We then introduced a topic model that revealed seven homogeneous skillsets
    within job postings. Such skillsets represent the competencies and activities
    employers across various industries seek in data analytics professionals.

    associations as revealed through topic modeling across three distinct professional
    profiles: Data Engineer, Data Analyst, and Data Scientist. To align these professional
    profiles with job postings, we leveraged a rule-based classifier. This classifier
    managed to determine the profile designation of a job listing based on keywords
    found within the job title. For instance, a job post titled "Data Architect" would
    be categorized as a Data Engineer role, while a posting titled "Machine Learning
    Engineer" would be attributed to the Data Scientist category.'

    weights for each job posting, spanning seven distinct skillsets. By calculating
    the mean weight of each skillset across all professional profiles, we arrive at
    the average skillset weight specific to each role. Notably, these weights are
    then normalized and represented as percentages.

    the "Data Warehouse & Cloud Infrastructure" skillset. Moreover, a supplementary
    grasp of Visualization and Machine Learning is imperative. This emphasis on skill
    diversity can be attributed to the anticipation that Data Engineers will be integral
    in supporting both Data Analysts and Data Scientists.

    Learning," closely followed by a proficiency in "Research" methodologies. Notably,
    a hybrid skillset encompassing "Business Management" and "Product Management"
    also ranks high in significance. This encapsulates the intricate array of competencies
    sought by the job market for aspiring Data Scientists.
  prefs: []

    for proficiency in "BI and Visualization." Given their role in generating business
    reports, driving dashboards, and monitoring business vitality, this comes as no
    surprise. The parallel demand for "Business Management" as a secondary key skill
    mirrors the strategic acumen expected from this role. Moreover, akin to the Data
    Scientist role, there's a parallel requirement for "Product Management" and "Research"
    proficiencies within the Data Analyst spectrum.
