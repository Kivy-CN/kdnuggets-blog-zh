    There are numerous [ones you should have](https://solutionsreview.com/business-intelligence/a-complete-list-of-the-best-data-science-programming-languages/)
    under your belt to ensure you're a well-rounded professional. If you want a solid
    starting point, statistics show that a growing number of job postings seeking
    data scientists [request that the respondents know Python](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-python-is-the-real-language-of-data-science-not-r/).
  prefs: []

- en: Fortunately, you can go through [a free Python tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-python-scratch-2/)
    offered by Analytics Vidhya. After doing that and feeling like you've gained a
    thorough understanding of it, consider learning R. It's another programming language
    often used in data science. Swirl offers [a step-by-step process](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)
    for people who want to learn R. You download an interactive console and take the
    course inside it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Podcasts cater to people who want to be educated and entertained while they
    do things like work out, commute to their offices or make dinner. They can also
    supplement your data science education and make it more fun by breaking up some
    of the monotony you may feel while learning on your own.

- en: '[Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/) is worth a listen because it makes
    high-level concepts more manageable by presenting them in bite-sized segments.
    The content also covers how data science applies to the real world, which could
    give you some inspiration about future career choices.'

    which features friends who live around the world virtually meeting up to discuss
    data science. Don't let its informal tone fool you into thinking you're not learning
    things you can use. Each episode aims to provide takeaways you can independently
    explore more as you learn.

    some and start creating a library of titles you can refer to as you learn. Try
    "[Data Science for Business](http://data-science-for-biz.com/)" to learn how to
    extract insights from information. That book is part of the data science curriculum
    at more than 150 higher learning institutions.

    is another title that helps you build a valuable foundation in the subject, especially
    as a self-taught person. Beyond these two books, think about making a list of
    the topics you encounter that interest and fascinate you. Then, search for books
    that mention those things.'

- en: One of the great things about the internet is that it offers people countless
    opportunities to learn at a speed that suits them. You can sign up for a data
    science course and work through it in a way that matches your schedule. For example,
    Udemy has [a data science bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/).
    It's a paid option, but the class claims to give you "the entire toolbox you'll
    need to become a data scientist" and says you don't need prior experience.

- en: Alternatively, [the Data Science Foundations learning path](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/data-science/)
    from CognitiveClass.ai offers content you can access at any time, plus provides
    a virtual lab where you can practice concepts learned. These are just two of the
    numerous possibilities that specifically relate to data science. It's also worthwhile
    to explore similar topics in an online course, such as machine learning or business
    analytics.

    changes in the environment thanks to improvements in the data used to train them.

    education momentum for helping you feel inspired. The [Data Science Conference](https://datasciconference.com/)
    is happening in Belgrade, Serbia, in November 2019, and it will have more than
    50 speakers. There's also the [Data Summit 2019](http://www.dbta.com/DataSummit/2019/Default.aspx),
    occurring in May in Boston.

    likely be surprised by how much you learn in such a short time. Plus, you'll have
    a deeper understanding of how data science applies to other fields, letting you
    keep up with trends and developments.

    careful which videos you choose, especially since some of them are merely ads
    for courses and don't give you the learning content. However, you still have plenty
    of possibilities to watch.
  prefs: []

    from freeCodeCamp.org when you're just getting started. There's also a semester-long
    free course from MIT called [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1lhuz6pZC0&list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd).
    Once you grasp the introductory material, branch out into more advanced topics.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Investigate to find out if your community has regular meetings of data scientists
    and learners. The MeetUp website is a fantastic place to start that could reveal
    new opportunities to you. For example, [New York offers various meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/data-science/us/ny/new_york/),
    including groups for female data scientists. [The options in San Francisco](https://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=false&keywords=Data+Science&radius=25&userFreeform=San+Francisco&gcResults=San+Francisco%2C+CA%2C+USA%3AUS%3ACalifornia%3ASan+Francisco+County%3ASan+Francisco%3Anull%3Anull%3A37.7749295%3A-122.41941550000001&change=yes&sort=default)
    are similarly diverse, and there are some groups for data science beginners.

    can meet data scientists face to face. You should enjoy benefits like those experienced
    after going to a conference but on a more regular basis.

    point, though, you need to put all the learning into practice. The best way to
    do that is to get engrossed in a data science project. [Springboard.com provides
    several](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science-projects/) to get you started.
    Then, once you become more experienced, come up with questions you want to solve
    and create projects [with free data sets](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects).
