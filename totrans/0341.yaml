    switch, then quickly stacked on JavaScript, Go, SQL, and a few others just for
    kicks. And he’s good, too, not just one of those people who put languages on their
    resume with no [data scientist skills](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/what-skills-do-you-need-as-a-data-scientist/)

    ago, and our conversation inspired this article. Without wanting to insult him
    too much, I brought up how his last interview had gone. He’d shown up a little
    late, he hadn’t sent a thank you email afterward, and while he aced every coding
    problem, he didn’t engage with the whiteboard questions any further than spitting
    out a perfectly correct answer.

    lucky to have you as a data scientist. But you need to work on your soft skills.”

    is all about knowing how to listen, especially in data science.'

    with a question about a campaign she wants to run. She''s excited about it and
    has a vision in her mind, but she''s not sure how to measure its impact or what
    data she needs. Instead of immediately diving into the technicalities of how you
    can pull the data or what models you can use, you first listen. You let her explain
    her goals, her concerns, and what she hopes to achieve with the campaign.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By actively listening, you can understand the broader context of her request.
    Maybe she's not just looking for a simple analysis but wants to understand customer
    behavior or segment the audience in a way she hadn't considered. By listening
    first, you can provide a solution that's tailored to her actual needs, not just
    the initial task.

    code into a keyboard all day; you will receive requests and have to put together
    presentations and deal with people. As in [data analyst skills](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/technical-skills-needed-as-a-data-analyst-with-1-2-years-of-experience/),
    you must know how to communicate to succeed.

- en: The StackOverflow 2023 Developer survey is actually a great example of adaptability.
    The authors introduced for the first time [an AI section](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#ai),
    showing remarkable adaptability to a changing landscape of development.

- en: 'AI is just one example. Data science is such a great illustration of that old
    adage: the only constant is change. To be a successful data scientist, you need
    to be ready to roll with the punches.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can mean many different things. The most obvious application is being able
    to learn new tech easily. Cloud technology is new. AI is new. FastAPI is new.
    You need to keep up with all of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another application is keeping up with the employment scene. The trend lately
    is not just to be a data scientist in the traditional sense; many employers expect
    you to wear many hats. You also have to be a data engineer, a machine learning
    engineer, and sometimes even a domain expert. The lines between these roles are
    blurring, and modern data scientists often find themselves juggling tasks that
    were once siloed into separate roles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also take it to mean understanding and integrating feedback. As data
    scientists, we often build models or solutions based on certain assumptions or
    datasets. But they don’t always work as expected. Being adaptable means taking
    this feedback in stride, iterating on your models, and improving them based on
    real-world results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Possibly the worst but most important application is being adaptable to getting
    fired or laid off.  2021 and 2022 were weird years for labor, with tons of big
    companies laying off great swathes of employees with little warning. It’s a good
    idea to anticipate this potential outcome and be ready for it.

- en: Remember how I harped on about communication? Teamwork and collaboration fit
    into that same bracket. As a data scientist, you do not only work with other data
    scientists. Everyone loves data-backed anything, so you will be the recipient
    of any number of requests to produce PowerPoint presentations, reports, and graphs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do this successfully, you have to play nice with others. Data science projects
    often involve working with cross-functional teams, including business analysts,
    engineers, and product managers. Being able to collaborate effectively ensures
    that the data science solutions align with business objectives.

    a new feature in our app. Obviously, data was needed to back their decision. They
    approached me and the rest of the data science team for insights on user behavior
    related to similar features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, the marketing team wanted to know how this new feature might
    affect user engagement and retention. Meanwhile, the engineering team needed to
    understand the technical requirements and how the data pipelines would be affected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our team became central to this. We had to gather requirements from the product
    team, provide insights to the marketing team, and work with the engineering team
    to ensure smooth data flow. This requires not just technical expertise but also
    the ability to understand the needs of each team, communicate effectively – and
    sometimes mediate between conflicting interests.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m taking the cop-out route and not mentioning *problem-solving* as the ultimate
    soft skill because I think it’s overused. But honestly, curiosity amounts to the
    same thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a data scientist, I probably don’t need to tell you that you’ll run into
    a lot of problems. But at their core, every problem is actually a question.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Our users aren’t converting,” becomes “How can we make this product more attractive?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “My model isn’t giving me accurate predictions,” becomes “What can I change
    to make my model more realistic?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Our sales have dropped in the last quarter," becomes "What factors influenced
    this decline and how can we address them?"'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of these problems, when approached with a curious mindset, transforms into
    a question that seeks understanding and improvement. Curiosity drives you to dig
    deeper, to not just accept things at face value, and to continuously seek better
    solutions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kevin, from my intro, was a curious person in general. But for some reason when
    it came to data science, he had blinkers on. Every problem became a nail that
    had to be solved with a code hammer. And the reality is that not much of data
    science work can be done that way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'He gave me an example of something he was asked at an interview recently: “The
    customer support team has been receiving complaints about the website''s checkout
    process. How would you address this?”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kevin went on in detail about how he’d fix the technical glitch. But the answer
    his interviewer was looking for was a question like, "Why are users finding the
    checkout process cumbersome?"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the real world, a data scientist would need to ask this question to solve
    the problem. Maybe users from a particular region are facing issues due to a local
    payment gateway's integration. Or perhaps the mobile version of the site isn't
    as user-friendly, leading to cart abandonment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By framing the problem as a question, the data scientist doesn't just stop at
    identifying the issue; they delve into the 'why' behind it. This approach not
    only leads to more effective solutions but also uncovers deeper insights that
    can drive strategic decisions.

    time management, and critical thinking, to name a few. But if you think about
    it, they all fall into those brackets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Communicate with people. Know how to change. Be able to work with others. And
    approach problems with curiosity. With those four soft skills, you’ll be able
    to tackle any issue, job interview, or bug that comes your way.
