- en: Determining how to structure, manage, and maintain your data science project
    are a series of nontrivial tasks which, if performed properly, can go a long way
    towards making your life easier as your project unfolds and matures. Aiming to
    ensure reproducibility adds an additional layer of complexity and difficulty,
    but can help contribute to a project's longevity and credibility.

    rather appropriately, [Build a Reproducible and Maintainable Data Science Project](https://khuyentran1401.github.io/reproducible-data-science/README.html).

- en: This book introduces Python tools for developing efficient workflows for reproducible
    and maintainable data science projects. We introduce best practices and tools
    which enable data scientists to be able to adapt to the ever growing demand in
    complexity, while ensuring that their systems are reliable.

    some insight into what is offered by the book, I suggest you take a quick look
    at section 2.1, [How to Structure a Data Science Project for Readability and Transparency](https://khuyentran1401.github.io/reproducible-data-science/structure_project/introduction.html).
    You'll get a quick understanding of how the book is structured, what it will be
    covering, the manner in which it does so, and the appreciation Tran has for standards
    and best practices (and following them). You will find an easy to read, well-structured
    and informative resource awaits you.

    choice to use this in the project (NB: a pip version of the project does exists
    for those who prefer). Poetry is a masterful Python dependency management tool
    with numerous features above and beyond pip. You can find out more about Poetry
    [here](https://python-poetry.org/).'

    installation, data and model management, and code conformity and organization.
    In short, whatever, you should be doing to ensure your code is reproducible and
    maintainable, Tran covers in this book. Not only are the concepts and practice
    covered, however, the accompanying GitHub repository holds a project that helps
    perform the entire set of tasks.
