- en: '[DALL-E](/dalle-3-is-here-with-chatgpt-integration), created by OpenAI is a
    deep learning model which has the ability to create visuals based on textual descriptions.
    This is achievable with the blend of computer vision and natural language processing.'

- en: The model was trained on a variety of datasets, such as photographs and written
    descriptions allowing the model to be able to detect objects and patterns so that
    it has the ability to produce images in different styles.

- en: When you think about a tool that can create images and videos for you, you think
    about the things it can do for you or cut costs elsewhere. And why this has been
    on a lot of organizations' minds is because the images generated by DALL·E 3 are
    all yours! This means that you do not need permission from OpenAI to reprint,
    sell or merchandise them.

    improve based on your textual description. For example, you can ask DALL-E 3 to
    change the circle to a water/oil drop to represent the brand more. Or even change
    the look completely to fit your needs.

    to the different types of visual content. You can create images and videos that
    you can use for social media posts. You can create images and videos that you
    can use for your website. You can easily generate these visual contents without
    having to invest so much of your personal time or the cost of hiring somebody
    to do it for you.

    own art. A lot of people have created instagram accounts to share their AI generated
    art and have done very well from it. Other artists are asking DALL-E to help them
    with the initial sketch so that they can develop. Some want to imitate an artist
    such as Van Gogh and DALL-E is aiding them.

    them a lot of time and money on product prototypes. Creatives now have the ability
    to explore new ideas and also benefit from past artists' styles and themes.

    to keep your students engaged. Some teachers do not even include visual materials,
    which can make certain students' learning process much harder.

    if you are holding biology lessons and there’s a focus on different types of lung
    conditions, you can use DALL-E to generate detailed images of how one's lung deteriorates
    overtime if they are a heavy smoker.
