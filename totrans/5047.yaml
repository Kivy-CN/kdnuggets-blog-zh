    it yourself (if not, or if you’re still looking for that bit of extra motivation
    to get started, see why you should be learning Python below). Of course, learning
    on your own can be a challenge and some guidance is always helpful. Guidance to
    learn Python for working with data is exactly what this article will provide you
    with.

    essential resources, such as the free [Python for Data Analysis courses and tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
    from DataCamp as well as reading and learning materials.

    we don’t recommend that you only learn Python and forget about the rest. However,
    learning Python is one of the best things you can do for your career. There are
    good reasons why Python is being adopted so widely by computer scientists, and
    why it’s a data analysis tool of choice for so many, the main one being the ease
    of learning and using Python. Nonetheless, it can be challenging to set a learning
    path, so that’s what we will do now.'

    simple. The most convenient way to go about this is to download the free [Anaconda
    package](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum Analytics, as it contains
    the core Python language, as well as all of the essential libraries including
    NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and IPython. By using the graphical installer,
    downloading Python is as easy as downloading any computer program.

    most important one is the iPython notebook, which is also called [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
    notebook. Once  you launch the notebook, the terminal is opened and a notebook
    is opened in your browser. Don’t get confused here! You don’t need internet connection
    to create or use the notebooks. Simply, the browser is used instead of a separate
    program and serves as your environment,where you can code.

- en: However, you are not limited to using the browser based Jupyter notebooks. If
    you prefer an IDE, a great option for data analysis is [Rodeo](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo)
    from Yhat. If you are familiar with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for R,
    Rodeo is something very similar for Python. Be sure to try out both alternatives,
    as, ultimately, the Python environment you use will depend on your personal preference.

- en: Now you are ready to begin learning to code with Python. There are a couple
    of good ways to go about this. Given your interest to learn Python for data analysis,
    your best option is the [Introduction for Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
    from DataCamp. This free course consist of video tutorials and interactive in
    browser exercises and is a great way to learn by doing, as opposed to simply reading
    concepts and looking at examples. You wouldn’t begin learning how to paint by
    reading a book about it. You would pick up a brush and start painting. That’s
    the way we would suggest for you to start learning Python! In addition to the
    introductory course, DataCamp offers an [Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science)
    course which takes you even further.

    While this course is not about data, but rather programming with Python, it is
    a great way to both practice with Python syntax and gain exposure to programming
    concepts that will be useful to you when working with data.

    data analysis and data science. What makes Python extremely useful for working
    with data, however, are the libraries that give users the necessary functionality.
    Below are the major Python libraries that are used for working with data. You
    should take some time to familiarize yourself with the basic purposes of these
    packages.
