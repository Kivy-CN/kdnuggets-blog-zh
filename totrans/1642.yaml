    to state so sweepingly that no statistician (in fact no scientist) was able to
    properly solve those toy problems prior to the 1980’s. How can one be so sure
    that some bright statistician or philosopher did not come up with the correct
    resolution of the Simpson’s paradox or a correct way to distinguish direct from
    indirect effects? The answer is simple: we can see it in the syntax of the equations
    that scientists used in the 20th century. To properly define causal problems,
    let alone solve them, requires a vocabulary that resides outside the language
    of probability theory, This means that all the smart and brilliant statisticians
    who used joint density functions, correlation analysis, contingency tables, ANOVA,
    etc., and did not enrich them with either diagrams or counterfactual symbols have
    been laboring in vain — orthogonally to the question — you can’t answer a question

    true. Practicing statisticians - as opposed to theoretically focused academics
    - work closely with their clients, who are specialists in a specific area. The
    language of that field largely defines the language of causation used in a particular
    context. That is why there has been no universal causal framework, and why statisticians
    in psychology, healthcare and economics, for instance, have different approaches
    and often use different language and mathematics. I myself draw upon all three,
    as well as Pearl’s. The utility of each, in my 30+ years’ experience, is case-by-case.
    There are also ad hoc approaches (some questionable).

    path diagrams or DAG with only few variables will frequently be inadequate and
    may badly mislead us. In the real world of a statistician, there are frequently
    a vast number of potentially relevant variables, including those we are unable
    to observe. There are also critical variables that, for many reasons, are not
    included in the data we have to work with and cannot be obtained. Measurement
    error may be substantial - this is not rare - and different causal mechanisms
    for different classes of subjects (e.g., consumers) may be in operation. These
    classes are often unobserved and unknown to us.

    analysis of causation into the spotlight. I would urge statisticians to read him
    but also consult (as I do) with other veteran practitioners and academics for
    their views on his writings and on the analysis of causation. There are many ways
    to approach causation and Pearl’s is but one. As Pearl himself will be aware,
    to this day, philosophers disagree about what causation is, thus to suggest he
    has found the answer to it is not plausible in my view. Real statisticians know
    better than to look for a Silver Bullet.

    skills who are, nevertheless, not so hot at using statistics to solve real-world
    problems. This is not an original observation. Perhaps the ASA, RSS and other
    professional organizations would be interested in periodic skills assessments,
    purely voluntary and with the aim of professional development?

    math, except, for some essential areas. It would be confidential. As an incentive,
    participants would be shown the correct answers after taking the test. Over time,
    participants would be able to get a sense of where they are strong and where they
    need to improve. We would also have some empirical evidence (if not from a truly
    representative sample) regarding the level of skill in key areas of practicing
    statisticians and researchers, which would be publishable. I would hope you would
    contribute some of the questions!

    I regard Causation as must reading. The Book of Why I feel also has value, as
    I also noted. You’ll be familiar of course with *Probabilistic Graphical Models*
    (Koller and Friedman), and I understand Professors Fenton and Neil will be publishing
    a new edition of *Risk Assessment and Decision Analysis*. Since you wrote the
    preface of the first edition, you obviously also feel this excellent book is worth
    reading.

    course of your long and distinguished career. For me, unfortunately, it’s time
    to put on the hard hat and get back to work.
