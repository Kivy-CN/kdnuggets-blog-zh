- en: Python still ranks high as one of the most popular programming languages due
    to its ability to create complex applications using simple and readable syntax.
    However, if you use Python, you know its biggest challenge is speed. Speed is
    an important element of programming, therefore does Python's great ability to
    produce complex applications with easy syntax dismiss its lack of speed? Unfortunately
    no.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are other programming languages such as C or C++, which have incredible
    speed, and higher performance in comparison to Python. Although Python is the
    most widely used programming language for AI, if speed is what you’re looking
    for, the majority of people stick with C, Rust, or C++.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The creator of Mojo Lang, Chris Latner, the creator of the [Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/)
    programming language and the [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure](https://llvm.org/)
    has taken the usability of Python and merged it with the performance of the C
    programming language. This has unlocked a new level of programming for all AI
    developers with unparalleled programmability of AI hardware and the extensibility
    of AI models.

    is 5000x, and Mojo Lang is 35000x faster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mojo Lang is a language that has been designed to program on AI hardware, such
    as GPUs running CUDA. It is able to achieve this by using Multi-Level Intermediate
    Representation (MLIR) to scale hardware types, without complexity.
  prefs: []

- en: Mojo Lang is a superset of Python, which means that it does not require you
    to learn a new programming language. Handy, right? The base language is fully
    compatible with Python and allows you to interact with the Python ecosystem and
    make use of libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).

    is speed. But there are a few more.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mojo Lang has a built-in struct keyword similar to a Python class. The difference
    is that struct is static, whereas class is dynamic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inside struct, Mojo Lang has keywords such as var, which is mutable and let
    which is immutable. def as we know in Python defines a function, in Mojo lang,
    def is replaced with fn which is a stricter function.
  prefs: []

    type that represents a vector where a single instruction can be executed across
    multiple elements, all in parallel on the underlying hardware.
