    of data visualization. SQL helps you slice, dice, and prepare your data in a way
    that makes it shine in whatever visualization tool you're using.

- en: So, what's in store for you in this read? We'll start by showing how SQL can
    be used to prepare data for data visualization. We'll then guide you through different
    types of visualizations and how to prepare data for each, and some of them will
    have an end product. All of this, is aimed at giving you the keys to create compelling
    visual stories. So grab your coffee, this is going to be a good one!

    why they are essential. Think of each chart or graph as a different "lens" to
    view your data. The type you choose can help you capture trends, identify outliers,
    or even tell a story.

    For example, you might use a histogram to understand the distribution of user
    ages in a mobile app. Tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python are commonly
    used to plot these charts.

    a compelling story with your data. SQL plays a critical role in scripting that
    story, helping you prepare, filter, and organize the data behind the scenes. Just
    like the gears in a well-oiled machine, SQL queries serve as the unseen mechanics
