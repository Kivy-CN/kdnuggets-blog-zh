    The movement fueled mainly by many courses' go-to model is the complex model,
    and it looks much more incredible to use a model such as Deep Learning or LLMs.
    The business people also didn’t help with this notion as they only saw the popular
    trend.

    the steps it uses to deliver the solution are less complicated than the advanced
    model. It might use fewer parameters or simpler optimization methods, but a simple
    model is still valid.

    or Law of Parsimony states that the simplest explanation is usually the best one.
    It implies that most problems can usually be solved through the most straightforward
    approach. That’s why simple model value is in its simple nature to solve the problem.

- en: When we talk about simple models, what constitutes a simple model? Logistic
    regression or naive Bayes is often called a simple model, while neural networks
    are complex; how about random forest? Is it a simple or complex model?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Generally, we didn’t classify Random Forest as a simple model but often hesitated
    to classify it as complex. This is because no strict rules govern the model''s
    simple level classification. However, there are a few aspects that might help
    to classify the model. They are:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The parameter is an inherent model configuration that is learned or estimated
    during the training process. Different from the concept of the hyperparameter,
    the parameter can’t be set initially by the user but is affected by the hyperparameter
    choices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples of parameters include Linear Regression coefficient, Neural Network
    weight and biases, and K-means cluster centroid. As you can see, the values of
    the model parameters change independently as we learn from the data. The parameter
    value is constantly updated in the model iteration until the final model is present.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linear regression is a simple model because it has few parameters. The Linear
    Regression parameters are their coefficients and intercept. Depending on the number
    of features we train, Linear Regression would have **n+1** parameters (n is the
    number of feature coefficients plus 1 for the intercept).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compared to the Neural Network, the model is more complex to calculate. The
    parameter in NN consists of the weights and biases. The weight would depend on
    the layer input (**n**) and the neurons (**p**), and the weight parameter number
    would be n*p. Each neuron would have its bias, so for each **p**, there would
    be a **p** bias. In total, the parameters would be around **(n*p) + p** number.
    The complexity then increases with each addition of layers, where each additional
    layer would increase **(n*p) + p** parameters.

- en: We have seen that the number of parameters affects model complexity, but how
    does it affect the overall model output performance? The most crucial concept
    is it affects the overfitting risks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overfitting happens when our model algorithm has poor generalization power because
    it’s learning the noises in a dataset. With more parameters, the model could capture
    more complex patterns in the data, but it also includes the noises as the model
    assumes they are significant. In contrast, a smaller parameter model has a limited
    ability means it is harder to overfit.

    which we will discuss further.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interpretability is a machine learning concept that refers to the ability of
    machine learning to explain the output. Basically, it is how the user could understand
    the output from the model behaviour. Simple model significant value is in their
    interpretability, and it’s a direct effect coming from a smaller number of parameters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With fewer parameters, simple model interpretability becomes higher as the model
    is easier to explain. Furthermore, the model's inner workings are more transparent
    as it’s easier to understand each parameter's role than the complex one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the Linear Regression coefficient is more straightforward to explain
    as the coefficient parameter directly influences the feature. In contrast, a complex
    model such as NN is challenging to explain the direct contribution of the parameter
    to the prediction output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interpretability value is enormous in many business lines or projects as a particular
    business requires the output can be explained. For example, medical field prediction
    requires explainability as the medical expert needs to be confident with the result;
    it’s affecting individual life, after all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Avoiding bias in the model decision is also why many prefer to use a simple
    model. Imagine a loan company trains a model with a dataset full of biases, and
    the output reflects these biases. We want to eliminate the biases as they are
    unethical, so explainability is vital to detect them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another direct effect of fewer parameters is an increase in the computational
    efficiency. A smaller number of parameters means less time to find the parameters
    and less computational power.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In production, a model with higher computational efficiency would become more
    accessible to deploy and have a shorter inference time in the application. The
    effect would also lead to simple models being more easily deployed on resource-constrained
    devices such as smartphones.

    spent on the processing and deployment.
