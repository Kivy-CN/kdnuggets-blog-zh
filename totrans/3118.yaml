    Engineer back then and I started to learn online first (before starting my Master’s
    degree). I remember that as I searched for online resources I saw only names of
    learning algorithms — Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree,
    Random Forest, Neural Networks and so on. It was very hard to understand where
    I should start. Today I know that the most important thing to learn to become
    a Data Scientist is the pipeline, i.e, the process of getting and processing data,
    understanding the data, building the model, evaluating the results (both of the
    model and the data processing phase) and deployment. So as a **TL;DR** for this
    post: Learn Logistic Regression first to become familiar with the pipeline and
    not being overwhelmed with fancy algorithms.'

    Regression first to become a Data Scientist. This is only my opinion of course,
    for other people it might be easier to do things in a different way.

    a data product, it is a good practice to build your whole pipeline first, keep
    it simple as possible, understand what exactly you’re trying to achieve, how can
    you measure yourself and what is your baseline. After that, you can do fancy Machine
    Learning and be able to know if you’re getting better.

    the “Modeling” part but also in “Data Understanding” and “Data Preparation”, imputing
    is one example for this.

    title is why “Logistic” and not “Linear” regression. And the truth is that it
    doesn’t matter. This question alone brings to notion 2 types of supervised learning
    algorithms — Classification (Logistic Regression) and Regression (Linear Regression).
    When you build your pipeline with Logistic or Linear Regression you’re becoming
    familiar with most of the Machine Learning concepts while keeping things simple.
    Concepts like Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Classification vs Regression,
    Linear vs Non-Linear problems and many more. Also you’re getting an idea about
    how to prepare your data, what challenges might be there (like imputing and feature
    selection), how do you measure your model, should you use “Accuracy”, “Precision-Recall”,
    “ROC AUC”? or maybe “Mean Squared Error” and “Pearson Correlation”?. All those
    concepts are the most important part of the Data Science process. After you’re
    familiar with them, you’ll be able to replace your simple model with much more
    complex one onces you’ve mastered them.

    it may do a good job. Take MNIST for example, you can achieve 95% accuracy using
    Logistic Regression only, it’s not a great result, but its more than good enough
    to make sure you pipeline works. Actually, with the right representation of the
    features, it can do a fantastic job. When dealing with non-linear problems, we
    sometimes try to represent the original data in a way that may be explained linearly.
    Here’s a small example of this idea: We want to perform a simple classification
    task on the following data:'

    example is nothing like real life, and in real life, it will be very hard to tell
    how exactly you need to change your data so a linear classier will help you, but,
    if you invest some time in feature engineering and feature selection your Logistic
    Regression might do a very good job.

- en: Linear Regression is good not only for prediction, once you have a fitted Linear
    Regression model you can learn things about relationships between the depended
    and the independent variables, or in more “ML” language, you can learn the relations
    between your features and you target value. Consider a simple example where we
    have data about house pricing, we have a bunch of features and the actual price.
    We fit a Linear Regression model and get good results. We can look at the actual
    weights the model learned for each feature, and if those are significant, we can
    say that some feature is more important than others, moreover, we can say that
    the house size, for example, responsible for 50% of the change in the house price
    and increase in 1 square meter will lead to increase in 10K in house price. Linear
    Regression is a powerful tool to learn relationships from data and statisticians
    use it quite often.

    Neural Networks. You can think of each neuron in the network as a Logistic Regression,
    it has the input, the weights, the bias you do a dot product to all of that, then
    apply some non linear function. Moreover, the final layer of a neural network
    is a simple linear model (most of the time). Take a look at this very basic neural
    network:'

    linear (or logistic) regression, we have the input (hidden layer 2), we have the
    weighs, we do a dot product and then add a non linear function (depends on the
    task). A nice way to think about neural networks is dividing the NN into two parts,
    the representation part, and the classification/regression part:'

    it looks like the learning algorithms are the most important part. The reality
    is that the learning algorithms are very complicated in most cases and require
    a lot of time and effort to understand, but are only a small part of the Data
    Science pipeline.
