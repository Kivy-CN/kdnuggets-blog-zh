    no-nonsense definitions, organized into 12 distinct topics. Starting with Big
    Data and progressing through to natural language processing, this definition train
    has stops at machine learning, databases, Apache Hadoop, and several more. It
    may take come time, but once you get through the terminology presented herein,
    you should have a good idea of the key terms of importance in data science. And
    don't worry if the definitions are too slim for you; links abound for expanded
    related reading opportunities where appropriate.

- en: Big Data. If somehow you've made it to this website and have not heard the term
    since it first gained momentum toward becoming a popular term [at least a decade
    and a half ago](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/09/a-very-short-history-of-big-data/),
    I really don't know what to say.
  prefs: []

    flippant usage, that really doesn't mean one knows what it actually means, or
    what it fully encompasses. Indeed, trying to exhaustively describe what Big Data
    is in a single post would be nonsensical, not the least of which reason being
    that there is no agreed-upon exhaustive description, nor should there be. Collecting
    some key terms associated with Big Data is not a bad idea, however, as it lays
    a common foundation from which to work forward.

    order to  "maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass
    similarity," (by [Han, Kamber & Pei](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/bk3/)) without

    dramatic uptick in online searches of late. Enjoying a surge in research and industry,
    due mainly to its incredible successes in a number of different areas, deep learning
    is the process of applying deep neural network technologies - that is, neural
    network architectures with multiple hidden layers - to solve problems. Deep learning
    is a process, like data mining, which employs deep neural network architectures,
    which are particular types of machine learning algorithms.

    in favor of more solidly technical skills like programming. Even machine learning
    learning algorithms, with their reliance on mathematical concepts such as algebra
    and calculus -- not to mention statistics! -- are often treated at a higher level
    than is required to appreciate the underlying math, leading, perhaps, to "data
    scientists" who lack a fundamental understanding of one of the key aspects of
    their profession.

    data engineers and data scientists with a powerful, unified engine that is both
    fast (100x faster than Apache Hadoop for large-scale data processing) and easy
    to use. This allows data practitioners to solve their machine learning, graph
    computation, streaming, and real-time interactive query processing problems interactively
