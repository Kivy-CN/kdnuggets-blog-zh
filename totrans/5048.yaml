    language, is to take a sample dataset to work with, experiment, and try the new
    skills and techniques you pick up along the way.

    Otherwise you can load a data set from the web or a csv file. To do so you can
    follow a [sample code](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/examples/notebooks/generated/regression_diagnostics.html)
    from available examples or forums like [Stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). 
    Always have your dataset available and treat it as a toy that you can play with
    and learn from.

- en: One of the most hands-on skills of working with data is data manipulation. Data
    doesn’t always come clean and analysis-ready. In order to be able to analyse data,
    we often need data that is manipulated through transformations, formatting, cleaning,
    etc. Pandas and Numpy are the go to tools for that in Python, so start learning
    how to use them with your sample dataset.

- en: Of course analyzing data is not just about formatting and making plots and graphs.
    The analytics begins with statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, data
    mining techniques, inferences and so on. Python is a fantastic tool for analyzing
    data because it has libraries such as Scikit-learn and StatsModels which contain
    the implementations of the models and algorithms that you might need for your
    analysis. Of course, as Python is a general purpose programming language, you
    are also free to program your own methods when you become an advanced user, though
    make sure you are not replicating what already exists.

    [K-nearest neighbors](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html),
    [Time Series](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/examples/notebooks/generated/tsa_arma_0.html))
    and find an example of implementation in Python.

    communication begins with good use of language and style. However, an equally
    important aspect of communicating your analysis is preparing legible reports.
    Luckily you have a handy tool for that in the form of the previously mentioned
    Jupyter Notebooks (see step 1).

- en: While you can use the Jupyter Notebooks as a place to code and do your analysis,
    you can also imbed text, formatted formulas, even images and video if you like.
    What’s more, you have to options of exporting your code in various formats that
    include PDFs, HTML, and Markdown.
