    in data science. I spent over $25K in tuition fees over the span of three years,
    only to graduate and realize that I wasn’t equipped with the skills necessary
    to land a job in the field.

    math and theory behind data science models. Once you learn to code, you will be
    able to work with real-world datasets and get a feel of how predictive algorithms
    function.
