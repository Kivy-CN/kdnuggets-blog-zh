    and LLMs — both simultaneously and individually — via a unified interface. Beyond
    some of the usual suspect LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Llama, and others, Poe has access
    to numerous customized chatbots such as those that rephrase your input into emojis;
    lack any interest in what you are asking it (really); thinks anything you do is
    a crime; and many more. The site has both free and subscription tiers. Poe was
    created by Quora.'

    Arguably the most capable model resulting in the highest quality generated images

- en: One of the more popular bots on Poe is the Midjourney bot. No, the bot does
    not provide access to the Midjourney models; instead it takes your rough prompt
    as input and rewrites it to increase your chances at generating acceptable images
    from the very beginning.

    below, performed exactly one image generation run for each prompt, and engaged
    in no cherry-picking of results in any way. All subjective calls were made by
    the author alone. Note that any additional Midjourney parameters that Poe may
    have appended to its new prompt, in order to best compare like fruit. I have added
    `--ar 16:9` to all prompts as 16:9 is the only acceptable image ratio, end of

    is a vibrant and dynamic interpretation of the ancient city, capturing its rich
    history and spiritual significance. The photo showcases a flurry of bold brushstrokes
    and vibrant colors, evoking a sense of energy and movement. The environment is
    filled with an aura of mysticism, with the narrow streets, ancient walls, and
    bustling markets all coming together in a harmonious chaos. The camera settings
    are experimental and avant-garde, pushing the boundaries of traditional photography.
    A Hasselblad X1D II 50C is used, paired with a Lensbaby Velvet 56 lens, allowing
    for creative blur and soft focus effects. Double exposure techniques and intentional
    camera movement are employed to add an ethereal and dreamlike quality to the image.
    Unlikely collaborators for this scene would be Alejandro González Iñárritu, the
    visionary director known for his immersive storytelling, Emmanuel Lubezki, the
    acclaimed cinematographer famous for his poetic visuals, David LaChapelle, the
    provocative photographer renowned for his surreal and vibrant compositions, and
    Iris van Herpen, the innovative fashion designer celebrated for her futuristic
    and sculptural designs --ar 16:9

    the Old City of Jerusalem, and I can tell you that none of the generated images
    are of any actual location there. But we can't judge the generated images by this
    metric; instead we have to use subjective standards of artistic value.

    anything) when discussing AI-generated images, I find that it''s the best word

    Imagine I wrote "mimicked artistic value". Still upset? Well, AI generated images
    are here and they aren''t going anywhere, and while reasonable people can disagree
    on how we refer to the process and end results of AI image generation, that''s
    not a discussion I''m looking to have right here, right now. I''m simply demonstrating
    how people who are inclined to attempt to improve their AI image generation prompts
    could attempt to do so.*'

    capturing my attention beyond a first glance. The second round, assisted by Poe,
    is more colorful and deserving of additional inspection beyond a glance, at least
    in my mind. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that, so opinions here
    will differ, but I selected the upper right image in both cases as the "best"
    representative for both image generation runs. I upscaled both, and share them
    below.

    in aggregate, to be better than the original prompt's images, and I likewise find
    Poe's best effort superior to my original prompt's best effort.

    urban backdrop. Her headshot captures her radiant smile and warm personality,
    showcasing her approachability and professionalism. The environment is a bustling
    city street, with blurred pedestrians and traffic in the background, emphasizing
    the woman as the focal point. The camera settings are carefully chosen to highlight
    her features and capture her essence. A Nikon D850 is used, paired with a portrait
    lens, such as a Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4G, to achieve a shallow depth of field
    and create a pleasing bokeh effect. The photo is framed with a balanced composition,
    utilizing leading lines from the surrounding architecture to add visual interest.

    to have a more "natural" feel to them, and determining that they are AI-generated
    takes a little longer than doing so for the basic prompt images. The lighting
    and the outdoor aspects seem to look more natural, and though it isn't by a wide
    margin, I would say some small percentage better.

- en: Maybe this article should have been called "*Kick Ass Midjourney Prompts with
    Poe**???***" I think the jury may be out on if this Poe bot helps you definitively
    craft better prompts for image generation — and if so, by how much? — though that
    definitely won't be solved with a measly single pair examples. I tended to like
    the Poe-assisted bests a little better than the basic prompts, but, once again,
    this is both subjective and a decision made using very few data points. Perhaps
    the takeaways should be that prompt engineering is a complex and fickle beast,
    and art (both *real* and AI-generated) is just too subjective to determine when
    something is better than something else.
