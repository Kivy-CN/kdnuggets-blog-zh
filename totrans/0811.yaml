  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the beginning of their data science journey, junior data professionals usually
    initiate by setting up Python and R on their personal computers. Subsequently,
    they write and run code using a local Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    like Jupyter Notebook Application or RStudio.

    there’s a rising demand for collaborative tools to deliver insights, predictive
    analytics, and recommendation systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is why the necessity for collaborative tools becomes paramount. These tools,
    essential for deriving insights, predictive analytics, and recommendation systems,
    are bolstered by reproducible research, notebook tools, and code source control.
    The integration of cloud-based platforms further amplifies this collaborative
    potential.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    companies. While its exact definition remains elusive, it generally refers to
    datasets that are so vast that they surpass the capabilities of standard database
    systems and analytical methods.
  prefs: []

    in terms of capturing, storing, managing, and processing the data in a reasonable
    timeframe.

    and professionals can rent access to anything from applications to storage from
    a cloud service provider.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    use it,** instead of dealing with the cost and complexity of maintaining a local
    IT infrastructure-?of their own.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    services?-?from applications to storage and processing power?-?typically over
    the internet and on a pay-as-you-go-basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regarding the most common providers, I am pretty sure you are all familiar with
    at least one of them. Google (Google Cloud), Amazon (Amazon Web Services) and
    Microsoft (Microsoft Azure stand as the three most common cloud technologies and
    control almost all of the market.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The term **cloud** might sound abstract, but it has a tangible meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At its core, the cloud is about networked computers sharing resources. Think
    of the Internet as the most expansive computer network, while smaller examples
    include home networks like LAN or WiFi SSID. These networks share resources ranging
    from web pages to data storage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In these networks, individual computers are termed *nodes*. They communicate
    using protocols like HTTP for various purposes, including status updates and data
    requests. Often, these computers aren’t on-site but are in data centers equipped
    with essential infrastructure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the affordability of computers and storage, it’s now common to use multiple
    interconnected computers rather than one expensive powerhouse. This interconnected
    approach ensures continuous operation even if one computer fails and allows the
    system to handle increased loads.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Popular platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Netflix exemplify cloud-based
    applications that can manage millions of daily users without crashing. When computers
    in the same network collaborate for a common goal, it’s called a *cluster*.
