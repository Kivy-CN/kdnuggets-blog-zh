    AI is. The agent is basically an entity that helps the AI, machine learning, or
    deep reinforcement learning to make a decision or trigger the AI to make a decision.
    In terms of software, it is defined as the entity which can take decisions and
    can make different decisions on the basis of changes in the environment, or after
    getting input from the external environment. the role of an agent is very important
    in these fields as all the parameters of an AI model depend primarily on the performance
    of the agent. In simpler words, the quick agent perceives external change and
    acts against it the better the results obtained from the model. Hence the role
    of the agent is always very important in [artificial intelligence](https://algoscale.com/artificial-intelligence-solution-providers/),
    machine learning, and deep learning. The most common example of AI agents is Alexa
    and Siri. As both of them act against the request of the user, gather information
    from the internet, provide solutions, and act accordingly. These agents are so
    intelligent that they can gather the complete information of the user and even
    suggest their user-related ads, and recommendations as well. (*Intelligent Agents

- en: Intelligent is a software-based program that can understand the situations,
    perceive the environment, and on the basis of past history and regular training
    refine its search. The most important part for the intelligent agent is basically
    the user input, i.e., which kind of things interest the user. The most common
    example of intelligent agents is the agents that are being used on Facebook, YouTube,
    and Google. They always show the ads which attract the user. For example, if you
    wanted to buy perfume online and you have searched two to three different stores
    on the internet for perfume, later on in your social media newsfeed you have observed
    different ads related to perfumes. These are due to the intelligent Ai based agents
    working behind all the search history and user input. The several types of intelligence
    are human agents, software agents, and robotic agents. (*What Is an Intelligent

    A brief discussion on each of them will be made in this section as follows.

- en: Simple Reflex Agents are the most common type of agent. They work on the current
    perception and ignore all the past history and past paths. A common example is
    a room cleaner agent which works only when there is dirt in the room regardless
    of the past history.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model-Based Reflect Agents are the ones that can observe the environment only
    partially. They also track the situation. The word “model” here refers to what
    is happening in the world, and it has an internal state, which basically represents
    the current state based on the history of the model.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Goal-Based agents are the agents doesn’t only require the current state, past
    state, and what to do only. They also need some sort of information regarding
    the target or the goal as well. They are more capable because they draw paths
    on the basis of other machine learning techniques in order to reach goals better
    and in an effective way. They choose actions based on the situation of the environment.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Utility-Based Agents are agents which are similar to those goal-based agents,
    but they have only added responsibility to cater to the utility as well. They
    provide the efficiency, and status of the work at each step of the work to the
    model. They provide efficiency in real numbers with the help of a feedback system
    in order to check the validity and efficiency of the system.

- en: Learning Agents are the most intelligent type of agents in this regard. They
    learn from the user inputs, previous history, environment, and surroundings. They
    have started like conventional agents with basic knowledge of the environment.
    it has different components like the learning element, which improves the capabilities
    of the agent with the failures and achievements. The other component is criticism,
    with the help of which the learning element gets the feedback if the work is in
    the right direction or not. The third one is the performance element; this component
    is responsible to measure the performance of the system and keep the system in
    full flow. The final component is the problem generator with the help of which
    the system will gain new and latest experiences and refine the work with more
    and more load work. (*Types of AI Agents - Javatpoint*, n.d.)

    mostly software-based. They worked in games, searches, and automatic form filling.
    In gaming, different companies trying to make their games more competitive use
    these AI-based agents. These agents are mostly learning agents sort of agents
    who have learned from the moves of the user and can go from the beginner level
    to pro-level by playing a number of games and past experiences. There are some
    other games that have used very low-level agents which are usually simple reflex
    agents, as they didn’t improve with the passage of time and a certain moment comes
    when the user gets bored with the game and leaves playing the game. In the same
    way, these agents also work in search engines as well. As observed google only
    shows us relevant pages depending on the user’s search history, previous inputs,
    and past experience. These agents are very strong are used in such searches and
    can capture data very quickly. (*Intelligent Agents: Characteristics and Applications
