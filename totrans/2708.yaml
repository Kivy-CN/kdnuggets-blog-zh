    recently released [“Forrester Wave™: Notebook-based Predictive Analytics and Machine
    Learning (PAML), Q3 2020” analyst report](https://hubs.ly/H0w5PSG0). The report
    highlighted Domino’s capability to “support the diversity of [machine learning]
    ML options with repeatability, discipline, and governance” while also mentioning
    the collaboration and governance capabilities that we believe differentiate Domino
    as a market leader.'

    Domino, we work with some of the most sophisticated data science organizations
    in the Fortune 100, and as a result, have developed an informed view on the critical
    components that data science teams need for success with an advanced data science
    platform. While scalable compute, access to code libraries, and repository management
    are essential, they are merely a foundation layer and table stakes for data science
    platforms.

    team needs. Here, we plotted the elements that we believe data science teams need
    to satisfy, and offer an approach to help them drive discipline, process, rapid
    iteration, and scale via consistent solution delivery to their stakeholders.

    focus is on fulfilling data science teams’ needs to help them produce data science
    products that drive impact to the business, not to sell your team more cloud storage
    like some of our competitors. These products are used by business stakeholders
    to transform the way their business operates and create business value.

    platform helps foster healthy stakeholder relationships and communications via
    a full suite of model monitoring, management, and collaboration features. We believe
    we see the world differently from most data science platform vendors who solely
    focus on delivering code and compute.

    by a reproducibility and collaboration engine that lets you see all of the assumptions,
    decisions, and actions that data science teams take when choosing the right method
    for problem-solving.

    100\. We have a unique vision for where notebook-based predictive analytics and
    machine learning platforms need to go next, and we look forward to continuing
    to realize that vision with our customers. We believe that Forrester feels as
    we do by giving Domino the the highest scores possible in the collaboration and
    platform infrastructure criteria, among the top scores in the ModelOps criterion,
    and among the second highest scores in the Strategy category.
