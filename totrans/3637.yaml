    data, source code, hyperparameters, environment configuration, and alike. Usually,
    many model iterations need to be computed before machine learning models can be
    leveraged in production.

    create an additional layer of complexity in data science projects. In order to
    manage this complexity, we need proper structures and processes as well as adequate
    software tools that cover the machine learning cycle.

    Apache 2.0 or MIT license. Stemming from the number of contributors, forks, watchers

    reviewed relevant websites, GitHub repos and documentation. Further investigation
    is carried out with respect to data visualization, location of servers (in case
    of PaaS/ SaaS), among others.
