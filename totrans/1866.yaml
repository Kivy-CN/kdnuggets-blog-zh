- en: Despite "Data Science" being a recently coined buzzword, it is not actually
    a new field of study. Much of the science behind it has been developed by physicists
    and mathematicians mostly over the past two centuries as part of work needed to
    solve other problems. (If you need a data scientist, hire a physicist!) Today,
    the need for data science has expanded beyond the physics laboratory, but the
    science behind it is still the same. We can continue using answers provided by
    physicists for questions in new arenas.

    same as the saying, "You don't know what you don't know." I don't believe from
    an information theory point-of-view that there is any way to detect if the data
    included in the dataset is missing crucial information. Perhaps, one way to get
    that would be an automated way of data source discovery and testing. Meaning,
    some algorithm would search out different data sources and include them -maybe
    temporarily- into the data stream. Then, it (i.e. Genie's cognitive processor
    &/or the Information Analyzer) would analyze the results. At some point, it could
    discover critical data. But, to the original question, I don't believe that it
    is possible for any agent to know that there is critical data missing if it has
    never previously been presented to the system.

- en: A few nights later as I stared at my ceiling pondering questions in quantum
    mechanics, it occurred to me that this problem has come up before in physics!
    Specifically, the problem was regarding the non-deterministic nature of quantum
    mechanics (QM), which led to the phenomena of entanglement described as "spooky
    action-at-a-distance" by Albert Einstein.

- en: That first problem (which is analogous for us, today, in data science) was that
    the same sequence of past/current events, i.e. the present state, would bifurcate
    into multiple possible future outcomes. Meaning that the predictions of QM are
    not deterministic as in Newtonian mechanics.

- en: 'German physicist Max Born (point of trivia: his granddaughter is Olivia Newton
    John) started thinking of quantum mechanics as a statistical interpretation. (This
    is consistent with what we do with Genie''s predictions. Given the current state,
    we calculate the probability of the future states by reviewing the frequency of
    those futures that have succeeded the current state in the past.) This made a
    lot of people, including Albert Einstein, very uncomfortable, prompting his famous
    quote, "God does not play dice". Attempting to disprove this interpretation, Einstein,
    Podolski, and Rosen came up with the [EPR thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox)
    as a paradox, which introduced the world to entanglement, i.e. a phenomenon that
    allows particles to instantaneously correlate their states, seemingly violating
    causality and signaling at the speed-of-light limitation . Turns out, this isn''t
    a paradox at all. Nature actually behaves this way!'

- en: To salvage determinism, American physicist David Bohm put forth the idea that
    the results only appear this way because there are unknown "[local hidden variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_hidden_variable_theory)"
    that - if accounted - would make deterministic predictions. John Bell (a friend
    of IA's Advisory Board Head, David McGoveran), came up with an [inequality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem)
    that was [used by experimenters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments)
    (Alain Aspect, et al.) that proved that there were no local hidden variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, the point for us is that such a test can theoretically be done for our
    data sets to prove or disprove any unknown variables that would be important for
    the predictions.

- en: The difference between quantum mechanics' and Genie's predictions is that QM
    relies on a highly constrained vigorous mathematical model. Genie, instead, relies
    on the data that has been observed. The former allows comparison of model against
    data. Or, as done with Bells' Inequality, compares the QM model against the deterministic
    "local hidden variable" model, against data. Since we designed Genie to not require
    a model of the data, the strength in the predictions comes from comparing new
    data against past data. Additionally, it would require a second deterministic
    model to compare against, which is not the case for the predictions made with
    Genie.

    data that hasn't been fed into the system.

    the boundaries of knowledge, as long as we take the time to apply proper scientific
