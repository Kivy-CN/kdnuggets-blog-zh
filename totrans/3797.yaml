    more people entering the industry everyday. However, it is a competitive industry.
    In order to continuously improve yourself, skill-set and increase your salary
    - you need to prove that you are a proficient programmer. One way you can do this
    is by learning the things that people don’t typically know.

    you do not need to know the Math behind it. Although this is somewhat true, being
    able to understand the logical mathematical concept behind programming will make
    you a more proficient programmer.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More on learning about numbers, we have floating point. A floating point is
    a variable data type which represents real numbers as an approximation. A floating-point
    number is a number in which the position of the decimal point can move around
    or "float" instead of being in a fixed position. This allows developers to make
    a trade-off between range and precision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But why an approximation? Computers only have a limited amount of space, either
    32 bits (single precision) or 64 bits (double precision). 64 bit is the default
    for programming languages such as Python and JavaScript. An example of floating-point
    numbers are 1.29, 87.565, and 9038724.2\. It can either be a positive or negative
    whole number with a decimal point.

    to answer the question. So why is logarithms important to programmers> Because
    it simplifies complex mathematical calculations. For example, 1000 = 10^4 can
    also be written as 4 = log101000.

- en: The base number is a mathematical object that needs to be multiplied by itself.
    The exponent is a number that identifies how many times a base number needs to
    be multiplied by itself. Therefore, a logarithm is an exponent which indicates
    to what power a base must be raised to produce a given number.

    common logarithm.

    any relation to one another. They can only contain unique items, and cannot contain
    the same item twice or more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example excel files or a database contain tables which have a set of unique
    rows. This is a type of discrete math as these structures can have a finite number
    of elements. The aim of set theory is to understand the collections of values,
    and the relations between one another. This is typically used for data analysts,
    SQL experts and data scientists.

    these values can be connected. When it comes to data, these values are connected
    due to variables - which in graph theory are known as links.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Graph Theory is the study of graphs concerning the relationship among edges
    and vertices of connected sets of points. This allows us to create a  pairwise
    relationship between objects using the vertices, also known as nodes that are
    connected by the edges, known as the lines. A graph is represented as a pair G(V,
    E), where V represents the finite set vertices and E represents the finite set
    edges.

    an algorithm. When it comes to time complexity, the best way to measure it is
    by considering the number of operations the algorithm performs. Algorithms are
    built using if-statements and loops, therefore to reduce time spent you want to
    use code that has as few if-statements and loops as possible.
