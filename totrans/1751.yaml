    I wanted to outline some of its most useful libraries for data scientists and
    engineers, based on recent experience.

- en: When starting to deal with the scientific task in Python, one inevitably comes
    for help to Python’s SciPy Stack, which is a collection of software specifically
    designed for scientific computing in Python (do not confuse with SciPy library,
    which is part of this stack, and the community around this stack). This way we
    want to start with a look at it. However, the stack is pretty vast, there is more
    than a dozen of libraries in it, and we want to put a focal point on the core
    packages (particularly the most essential ones).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most fundamental package, around which the scientific computation stack
    is built, is NumPy (stands for Numerical Python). It provides an abundance of
    useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python. The library
    provides vectorization of mathematical operations on the NumPy array type, which
    ameliorates performance and accordingly speeds up the execution.

- en: SciPy is a library of software for engineering and science. Again you need to
    understand the difference between SciPy Stack and SciPy Library. SciPy contains
    modules for linear algebra, optimization, integration, and statistics. The main
    functionality of SciPy library is built upon NumPy, and its arrays thus make substantial
    use of NumPy. It provides efficient numerical routines as numerical integration,
    optimization, and many others via its specific submodules. The functions in all
    submodules of SciPy are well documented — another coin in its pot.

    data simple and intuitive. Pandas is a perfect tool for data wrangling. It designed
    for quick and easy data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization.

- en: Another SciPy Stack core package and another Python Library that is tailored
    for the generation of simple and powerful visualizations with ease is Matplotlib.
    It is a top-notch piece of software which is making Python (with some help of
    NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas) a cognizant competitor to such scientific tools as MatLab
    or Mathematica.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the library is pretty low-level, meaning that you will need to write
    more code to reach the advanced levels of visualizations and you will generally
    put more effort, than if using more high-level tools, but the overall effort is
    worth a shot.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Seaborn is mostly focused on the visualization of statistical models; such visualizations
    include heat maps, those that summarize the data but still depict the overall
    distributions. Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and highly dependent on that.

    visualizations. In contrast to the previous library, this one is independent of
    Matplotlib. The main focus of Bokeh, as we already mentioned, is interactivity
    and it makes its presentation via modern browsers in the style of Data-Driven
    Documents (d3.js).
