- en: A vector database is a type of database that stores data as mathematical vectors,
    which represent features or attributes. These vectors have multiple dimensions,
    capturing complex data relationships. This allows for efficient similarity and
    distance calculations, making it useful for tasks like machine learning, data
    analysis, and recommendation systems.

- en: In simple terms, vectors are determined to represent data attributions. For
    example, a vector could represent the color of an image, the sentiment of a piece
    of text, or the location of a point on a map.
