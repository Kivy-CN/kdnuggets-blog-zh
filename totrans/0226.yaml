    (IoT) has been fuelled by the falling cost of sensors, the proliferation of connected
    devices, and the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). The IoT is the network
    of physical objects (vehicles, devices, buildings, etc.) embedded with sensors,
    software, electronics, and network connectivity that allows these objects to collect
    and exchange data. According to a recent report from McKinsey, the IoT could have
    a total economic impact of up to [$12.6 trillion](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/iot-value-set-to-accelerate-through-2030-where-and-how-to-capture-it)
    per year by 2030.

- en: The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a system of connected sensors and devices
    that can collect and exchange data. The data collected by these devices can be
    used to automate processes, improve efficiency, and make better decisions.

- en: IoT devices are typically equipped with sensors that can detect various environmental
    conditions, such as temperature, light, and sound. These sensors can also track
    the location of devices and detect when they are being used. IoT devices can be
    connected to the internet using a variety of technologies, such as WiFi, Bluetooth,
    and cellular data. It’s estimated there were [25 billion devices](https://tokenist.com/with-25-billion-iot-connected-devices-by-2021-whats-the-impact-on-fintech/)
    connected to the IoT in 2021.

- en: IoT devices can be used to automate a variety of tasks. For example, a sensor
    that detects when a door is opened can be used to turn on the lights. Or a sensor
    that detects when a car is parked can be used to open the garage door automatically.
    IoT devices can also be used to collect data for analytics purposes. For example,
    a sensor that tracks the number of people who enter a store can be used to analyze
    customer traffic patterns.

    a bunch of devices connected to the internet and collecting data. However, [artificial
    intelligence](/2021/01/top-5-artificial-intelligence-trends-2021.html) can make

- en: Say you have a connected thermostat in your home. This thermostat collects data
    about the temperature in your home over time. However, it is the AI that can take
    this data and use it to improve the efficiency of your heating and cooling system.
    The AI can do this by constantly learning and improving its algorithms by trial
    and error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if the AI notices that the temperature in your home is too cold,
    it will adjust the settings of your heating system accordingly. The AI will also
    consider other factors, such as the weather and time of day. This allows the AI
    to constantly optimize the performance of your heating and cooling system, saving
    you money in the process.
