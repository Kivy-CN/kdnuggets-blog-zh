    is helping us create better and better models with easy to use and great API’s.
    Here I’ll talk to you about Auto-Keras, the new package for AutoML with Keras.
    There’s a surprise in the end ;).

- en: AutoML is not automated data science. While there is undoubtedly overlap, machine
    learning is but one of many tools in the data science toolkit, and its use does
    not actually factor in to all data science tasks. For example, if prediction will
    be part of a given data science task, machine learning will be a useful component;
    however, machine learning may not play in to a descriptive analytics task at all.

    running on top of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk),
    or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). It was developed with a focus on
    enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least
