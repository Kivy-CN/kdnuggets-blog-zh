- en: This is going to be the most important focus area for 2018\. Most enterprises
    have done proof of concepts on ML and are looking to realize the full value of
    their data with full fledged production implementations of the algorithms. The
    key technologies in this space may be [Clipper](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/low-latency-model-serving-clipper/).
    Clipper is the state-of-art ML serving system from Rise labs, Berkeley university
    and uses distributed computing concepts to scale models, containerized model deployment
    to handle models created in any platform and also performs cross-framework caching
    and batching to leverage parallel architectures like GPUs. Finally, Clipper can
    also perform cross-framework model composition using ML techniques like ensembling
    and multi-armed bandits.

    to as autoML — similar to [Michelangelo from Uber](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/).
    Many open source frameworks such as TPot and AutoSKLearn have emerged which help
    in automatically searching the space of multiple models with appropriate hyper-parameters
    and select best model for the task at hand. Model management which is the ability
    to keep track of hundreds of models in production including the model/analytics
    lineage — things like what metrics were evaluated for each model on what data
    sets and results, essentially, the whole cycle of model development, retraining
    and refresh etc. ModelDB is one possible choice in this space.

    name of Machine Learning Logistics whose key tenet is the Rendezvous architecture.
    Key elements of the Rendezvous architecture include stream based microservices
    and containerization as well as DataOps style of design that facilitates canaries
    and decoys. Decoy is a model that does not perform any operation on input data — it
    is used to persist a copy of the input streams. Canary is a model that provides
    a reference or baseline against which other models can be compared against. The
    Rendezvous architecture allows models to be monitored to a great extent and allows
    model drift to be measured, allowing newer models to take over slowly and seamlessly.

    including the well known article by [Gary Marcus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00631.pdf) and
    this article in [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/01/deep-learning-flaws-universal-machine-learning.html).
    Gary argues that deep learning’s limitations arise primarily from having only
    finite data to train, while it may actually need infinite data for perfect generalization.
    The KDNuggets article shows how deep learning networks trained for classification
    can be easily fooled by perturbations in input images as well as by random (nonsensical)
    images which generate high confidence misclassifications.

    with reinforcement learning for the Atari game playing system or the AlphaGo,
    the Go game playing system which combined deep learning with MonteCarlo tree search,
    deep learning is quite useful and can be combined with other known ML techniques
    to produce great results.

    approach](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45826.html) has shown how a reinforcement
    learning approach can compose certain forms of recurrent networks which can outperform
    existing systems by a significant factor.

    small molecules — it has shown that deep learning (a specific form of deep learning
    known as message passing neural networks) can be applied to graph structured data
    and is invariant to graph isomorphism.'

    user behaviour using Survey seems to be falling flat. This was evident in Netflix,
    when they encountered classic films which were rated very highly by users, but
    not being actually watched. This is also evident in Google searches and was the
    subject of a recent Strata Data keynote. The Google researcher made the point
    that in a Survey of Maryland graduates, only 2% said their CGPA was less than
    2.5, while in reality 11% have CGPA less than 2.5\. Similarly, in another survey,
    40% of engineers in an organization said they are in the top 5% of engineers in
    the company. Google searches is the digital truth serum, in which people are more
    truthful than on any surveys or on other platforms. This also tells us that we
    should be looking out for implicit signals (such as what people actually are watching
    on Netflix), rather than being dependent on explicity feedback through surveys
    to understand consumer’s behaviours. This is also evident in some of the recommendation
    system developed by Pinterest as documented in this [keynote speech](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ca/public/schedule/detail/66316);
    they used implicit signals of how users interact with pins (save pins, repin other
    users pins, search for pins as well recommendations that users do not like or
    ignore) and were able to recommend appropriate personalized content for users
    based on graph based recommendation engine.

- en: Model interpretability or explainability is the ability of an ML algorithm to
    explain why it is making a prediction in a certain way. It could be that due to
    a number of cases seen in the training data of frauds, system is potentially concluding
    this to be a case of fraudulent transaction. Model interpretability is becoming
    important as more and more ML models are being put into production in several
    domains such as finance, insurance, retail and even healthcare. An emerging technologies
    in this space include [Skater](https://github.com/datascienceinc/Skater) and [Lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)among
    others.

    Protection Regulation (GDPR) are important in this respect. GDPR for instance,
    have rules in place which tell that user’s consent is necessary to even collect
    personal data. Users also have rights to ask questions about the data being collected
    as well as modify the data or delete them or object to the use of personal data
    for targeting if they desire so. Data processors also have certain obligations
    as per GDPR. GDPR will influence design of all data products in 2018.

    but it is also important to secure the BI and the analytics. This is where the
    privacy-preserving analytics become relevant and is going to assume great importance
    in 2018\. The technology relevant for securing BI is a recent joint work between
    Uber and Rise Labs, Berkeley university, which guarantees differential privacy
    for SQL queries based what is known as elastic sensitivity that combines local
    sensitivity mechanism with general equijoins.

- en: Privacy preserving analytics especially for deep learning models is achieved
    using a technique called federated learning that is popularized by Google. It
    is based on a centralized parameter server which hosts all the parameters required
    for learning. Each phone can download the parameters, use the local data to improve
    the model and compose a small update message and send it back to the parametric
    server. The server aggregates updates from several phones and updates the model
    parameters centrally. The interesting part of federated learning is that data
    is all local, while learning is global. Each phone updates the model by using
    its own local data and performing its computation locally — decoupling the ML
    from storing data on the cloud. This is being used in Gboard (Google Keyboard)
    on Andriod.

- en: The above single model training by using federated learning does have challenges
    such as high communication overhead, stragglers and fault-tolerance as well as
    the statistical challenges of fitting model to the data. This is being addressed
    by [recent work](http://www.sysml.cc/doc/30.pdf) in this space from CMU by using
    federated kernelized multi-task learning that addresses the statistical challenges
    by using multiple models and updating them simultaneously, while the system challenges
    are addressed by MOCHA, the distributed optimization model.
