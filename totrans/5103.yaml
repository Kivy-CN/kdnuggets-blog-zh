    SQL without paying?

    most cases, categorized as easy or medium, which could make looking for advanced

  prefs: []

    topics. I threw in the mix something different, too: one YouTube course by a top
    German university and one online book by a recognized expert and educator.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    each resource. If you don’t find what you’re looking for in one course, you can
    always combine the resources and fill in the gaps.

    Happy learning!
