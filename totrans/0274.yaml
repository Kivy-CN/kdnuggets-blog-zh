    is a [wide range of companies](http://nordicapis.com/20-emotion-recognition-apis-that-will-leave-you-impressed-and-concerned/)
    trying to detect your emotions from what you write, the tone of your voice, or
    from the expressions on your face. All of these companies offer their technology
    online through cloud-based programming interfaces (APIs).

    built early prototypes of [facial expression](https://medium.com/@kidargueta/detecting-emotion-in-faces-using-geometric-features-a9a7febe024f#.3jqslnqq9)
    and [speech content](https://medium.com/@kidargueta/offline-emotion-specific-speech-to-text-in-low-end-devices-62b9cc195713#.fje08wd1w)
    recognition for emotion detection. In this short article I describe the missing
    part, a voice tone analyzer.

- en: In order to build a tone analyzer, it is necessary to study the properties of
    the speech waveform (a two dimensional representation of a sound). Waveforms are
    also known as time domain representations of sound as they are representations
    of changes in intensity over time. For more details about the waveform you can
    refer to this [interesting page](http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/acoustics/waveforms/speech_waveforms.html).

- en: Using software specifically designed to analyze speech, the idea is to extract
    certain characteristics of the waveform that can be used as features to train
    a machine learning classifier. Given a collection of speech recordings, manually
    labelled with the emotion expressed, we can construct vector representations of
    each recording using the extracted features.

- en: The features used in emotion detection from speech vary from work to work, and
    sometimes even depend on the language analyzed. In general, many research and
    applied works used a combination of pitch, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
    (MFCC), and Formants of speech.

- en: Once the features are extracted and the vector representations of speech constructed,
    a classifier is trained to detect emotions. Several types of classifiers have
    been utilized in previous works. Among the most popular are Support Vector Machines
    (SVM), Logistic Regressions (Logit), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Neural Networks
    (NN).

- en: As an early prototype I have implemented a simplified version of an emotion
    detection classifier. Instead of detecting several emotions like joy, sadness,
    anger, etc., my tone analyzer performs a binary classification to detect the level
    of arousal of a user. A high level of arousal is associated with emotions like
    joy, surprise, and anger whereas a low level of arousal is associated with emotions
    like sadness and boredom. The video below shows my tone analyzer running on a
    Raspberry Pi. Enjoy!
