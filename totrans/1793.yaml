- en: In our experience working with many quantitative professionals over the years,
    the two main areas that contribute to long-term career growth are networking and
    continuous learning. Even though both can open up a lot of career opportunities
    down the road, networking can seem daunting for many, and when it comes to lifelong
    learning many professionals simply aren’t sure where to start. Here is our best
    advice about how to prepare for the road ahead!

    luncheons, conferences, or networking events for your local chapter of the [ASA](http://www.amstat.org/)
    (American Statistical Association) or [INFORMS](https://www.informs.org/) (The
    Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences), can introduce
    you to other professionals in your field, and both offer membership benefits like
    career resources.'

    a good way to connect with people who aren’t local, and to stay informed of trending
    topics and new developments in analytics, data science, machine learning, market
    mix modeling, digital marketing, etc.'

    presentations. You can [browse meetups here](https://www.meetup.com/find/).'

- en: '**Keep your LinkedIn profile and resume updated** – This should almost go without
    saying! Even if you aren’t currently looking, you always want your profile to
    be professional and represent you in the best light. Likewise, even if you’re
    not job searching you should keep your resume up-to-date. It is easier to articulate
    your impact on a project when it is fresh in your mind, and, if you wait too long,
    you might find it difficult to summarize your data projects in resume format.
    And, when you do finally decide to start looking, it will expedite the process,
    since your resume will hopefully just need a few tweaks rather than a complete
    overhaul. You can find more of our analytics resume tips [here](http://www.burtchworks.com/2017/01/23/career-growth-tips-analytics-data-science/2.%09http:/www.burtchworks.com/2016/05/09/resume-tips-analytics/).'

- en: '**Practice talking points about background and interests** – Networking can
    be nerve-wracking for many, and, even if that’s not the case for you, practicing
    talking about your background (and yourself!) can help you stay focused on the
    points that you want to get across. Obviously you don’t want to sound like a robot
    with a script, but even simply reading through your resume few times and thinking
    of questions that you’d like to ask other people can be beneficial.'

    dream company in the elevator at a conference, you want them to have a way to
    look you up on LinkedIn later! If you don’t already have business cards, [Vistaprint](http://www.vistaprint.com/)
    has a wide range of options.'

- en: '**Online courses/certifications** – With the current boom in analytics and
    data science, there are many options for learning and adding to your toolkit and
    skillset. Only worked in R? Consider taking a course on SAS or Python. Want to
    learn more about machine learning? Browse the offerings on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/),
    [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). Some
    universities even offer online certificates as well. Analytics and data science
    tools will continue to evolve, so stay aware of new developments in your area.
    If you only learn how to use one tool and then that tool becomes obsolete, you
    may have trouble adapting your skills.'

    to get access to messy data and complex problems, both of which are key to keeping

    tailored specifically to analytics and data science professionals. There are a

    data science trends, it’s also wise to keep a general awareness of the political
    and financial news climate, especially if this affects the industry you’re working
    in (such as finance!). Consider subscriptions to relevant sources like newsletters,
    The Economist, healthcare journals, etc., because these can help give you a wider
    business context.'

    an overall sense for the job market or hiring trends that top-line job statistics
    might not necessarily capture. Recruiters can also give you a sense for what data
    science and analytics tools and skills are most in-demand, since they work with
    a variety of clients.'
