- en: Missing values are an eventual reality in almost every dataset. Sometimes it
    may even be a cause for concern if there were no missing values just because you
    expect there to be data missing. Dealing with missing values have been a subject
    of debate for decades among statisticians due to it compromising the reliability
    of sample studies if left unchecked or incorrectly dealt with. In many university
    courses, students are simply taught to impute the missing values with the mean
    for continuous data, median for categorical data or to simply remove rows with
    missing values if it is just a small representation of your dataset (heuristically,
    less than 10% has been the threshold). Many statisticians in industry agree that
    blindly imputing the missing values in your dataset is a dangerous move and should
    be avoided without first understanding why the data is missing in the first place.

- en: Missing completely at random (MCAR) is defined as when the probability that
    the data are missing is not related to either the specific value which is supposed
    to be obtained or the set of observed responses. However, if data are missing
    by design, because of an equipment failure or because the samples are lost in
    transit or technically unsatisfactory, such data are regarded as being MCAR. The
    statistical advantage of data that are MCAR is that the analysis remains unbiased.
    Power may be lost in the design, but the estimated parameters are not biased by
    the absence of the data.

    income data missing, the missing data is MCAR is there is no relationship between
    the missing income data and the age of the participants. There is no pattern to
    the missing data.'

- en: Data are regarded to be MAR when the probability that the responses are missing
    depends on the set of observed responses, but is not related to the specific missing
    values which is expected to be obtained. As we tend to consider randomness as
    not producing bias, we may think that MAR does not present a problem. However,
    MAR does not mean that the missing data can be ignored. If a dropout variable
    is MAR, we may expect that the probability of a dropout of the variable in each
    case is conditionally independent of the variable, which is obtained currently
    and expected to be obtained in the future, given the history of the obtained variable
    prior to that case.

- en: If the characters of the data do not meet those of MCAR or MAR, then they fall
    into the category of missing not at random (MNAR). The cases of MNAR data are
    problematic. The only way to obtain an unbiased estimate of the parameters in
    such a case is to model the missing data. The model may then be incorporated into
    a more complex one for estimating the missing values.

- en: This is the most simple and less time consuming method of all. It simply means
    to just conduct your analysis on rows of data that have no missing values. This
    is sadly default behaviour in most academic settings when your student learning
    data preprocessing. This should only be used if we can confirm our missing data
    is MCAR. If not our analysis results cannot be unbiased. In reality, this is more
    significant in industries like pharma than other industries where it is common
    practice. If there is a large enough sample, where power is not an issue, and
    the assumption of MCAR is satisfied, the listwise deletion may be a reasonable
    strategy. However, when there is not a large sample, or the assumption of MCAR
    is not satisfied, the listwise deletion is not the optimal strategy.

- en: In this scenario, instead of removing data like in Listwise Deletion, Pairwise
    Deletion calls for conducting analysis using the rows and columns that do not
    have any missing values and omitting the ones that do. This healps to retain data
    and improve statistical power, however now analysis cannot be compared to due
    to varying sample sizes and biased standard errors. Pairwise deletion is known
    to be less biased for the MCAR or MAR data. However, if there are many missing
    observations, the analysis will be deficient.

- en: Imputation involves replacing missing values with substituted values obtained
    from a statistical analysis to produce a complete data set without missing values
    for analysis. Imputations can be created by using either an explicit or an implicit
    modeling approach. The explicit modeling approach assumes that variables have
    a certain predictive distribution and estimates the parameters of each distribution,
    which is used for imputations. It includes different methods of imputation by
    mean, median, probability, ratio, regression, predictive-regression, and assumption
    of distribution.

- en: In these cases, using a point estimate such as mean and median are commonly
    used but are highly unreliable mostly due to data skewness and this method is
    more suited towards data that resemble a normal distribution (which is unlikely
    on real world data). Real world data is often skewed which make descriptive statistics
    like mean and median less useful
