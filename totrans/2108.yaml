    about how prompt engineering is "AI's hottest new job" or whatever. You know what
    prompt engineering is, or you wouldn't be here. You know the discussion points
    about [its long term feasibility](https://www.kdnuggets.com/prompt-engineering-an-integrated-dream)
    and whether or not it's a legitimate job title. Or whatever.

    basic prompting to RAG and beyond, this cheat sheet covers an awful lot of ground
    and leaves very little to the beginner prompt engineer's imagination.

    "a quick-start handbook for effective prompts," came out of Google Cloud Next
    in early April.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This guide explores different ways to quickly jump in and gain mastery of the
    basics to help you accomplish your day-to-day tasks. Explore foundational skills
    for writing effective prompts organized by role and use case. While the possibilities
    are virtually endless, there are consistent best practices that you can put to
    use today — dive in!

    that plan. While designed specifically with Gemini in mind, much of the content
    is more generally applicable, so don't shy away if you aren't deep into the Google
    Workspace world. The guide is doubly apt if you do happen to be a Google Workspace
    enthusiast, so definitely add it to your list if so.

    LLaMA-7B) to identify and remove non-essential tokens in prompts. This approach
    enables efficient inference with large language models (LLMs), achieving up to
    20x compression with minimal performance loss.
