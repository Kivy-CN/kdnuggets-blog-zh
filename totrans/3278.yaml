    it just ***is***. Big Data is not easily or precisely definable, but it is generally
    easy to identify when you see it.

    ever-increasing amounts of Big Data at algorithms and [hoping for the best](/2017/06/practical-importance-feature-selection.html),
    the ability to leverage large amounts of data for machine learning tasks is a
    must-have skill for practitioners at this point.

- en: While much of machine learning holds true regardless of data amounts, there
    are aspects which are the exclusive domain of Big Data modeling, or which apply
    moreso than they do to smaller data amounts. Data scientist [Rubens Zimbres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubens-zimbres/)
    outlines a process for applying machine to Big Data in his original graphic below.

- en: The most important part is the one where the data scientist's needs generate
    a demand for change in data architecture, because this is the part where Big Data
    projects fail. The orange square. When algorithms are computationally expensive
    or when infrastructure is not ready for ML algorithms. For instance, lately big
    banks in Brazil are hiring mainframe specialists to deal with this issue.

- en: Zimbres' process includes paths for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive
    analysis, as well as simulation. Importantly, the machine learning process is
    explicitly noted as recursive, which is perhaps especially true of modeling large
    quantities of data. Zimbres also breaks down the relative number of records at
    each successive stage of a machine learning task. Likely of greatest importance
    to newcomers to data science, the sub tasks of the machine learning process are
    presented alongside task-relevant algorithms.

    graphic (notably, the inclusion of Support Vector Machines in the "Extraction
    of Groups" section should be replaced with k-means clustering), all in all it
    represents a relevant high-level roadmap. In particular, it should be useful for
    newcomers to data science.
