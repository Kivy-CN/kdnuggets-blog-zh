    host variable. For example: let’s consider we want to filter out some low value
    pixel or high value or (any condition) in an RGB image and yes it would be great
    to convert RGB to gray scale but for now we won’t go for that rather than deal
    with color image.'

    all the pixel value which is below than, let’s assume 20\. For this we’ll use
    logical operator to do this task which we’ll return as a value of True for all
    the index.

    i refer it because it behaves. It just holds the True value and nothing else.
    So, if we see the shape of both low_pixel and pic , we’ll find that both have
    the same shape.

    the values less than 200\. However, we can use this low_pixel array as an index
    to set those low values to some specific values which may be higher than or lower
    than the previous pixel value.

    distance from center of the image to every border pixel values. And we take a
    convenient radius value and then using logical operator we’ll create a circular
    disc. It’s quite simple, let’s see the code.

    the colors in each rgb layer mean something. For example, the intensity of the
    red will be an indication of altitude of the geographical data point in the pixel.
    The intensity of blue will indicate a measure of aspect and the green will indicate
    slope. These colors will help to communicate this information in a quicker and
    more effective way rather than showing numbers.

    what the altitude, what’s the slope, what’s the aspect. So that’s the idea of
    loading some more meaning to these colors to indicate something more scientific.
