- en: The age of fast-fashion and the evolving consumer buying trends have made it
    a lot more challenging and complicated for brands to predict future buying behavior
    and source products that are likely to be in demand. Intelligence Node’s access
    to immense online and competitor data and proprietary AI analytics puts it at
    an advantage to understand trends based on more than one factor and analyze this
    data **to forecast the probability of future success** **based on historical data
    and product attributes. **

    that has evolved into a **Limited Memory model.** Considering the application
    of the model and if and when ‘Theory of Mind’ systems are more advanced, we can
    transition and make the forecasts ‘aware of the variables that can actually influence
    feelings and behaviors’. We can start looking at the retail marketplace (that
    can be further segmented into groups) as an individual(s) with its own feelings
    and tantrums…the ‘Mr. Market’ [allegory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory)
    created by [Benjamin Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham) comes
    to mind.

    in the past, where it is in the product life cycle and how it was received by
    the audience can lead to insights on its future success (and future success of
    emerging trends that are similar) if combined with other key determining factors.

    it essential for retail businesses to harness the power of advanced retail technology
    and AI analytics. The success of retail businesses will largely depend on how
    effective they are in harnessing data as a strategic decision-making tool. Leveraging
    advanced analytics will help retailers derive insights to identify future trends
    and consumer preferences for future-proofing retail businesses and making data-driven
    decisions that will positively impact future outcomes. This is exactly what Intelligence
    Node’s latest Probability of Future Success Model aims to offer to the retail
    ecosystem. It is a solution that will empower brands, retailers, and manufacturers
    with **actionable insights into the probable future by analyzing and deriving
    insights from vast amounts of data, parameters, and attributes -** enabling them
    to make manufacturing, sourcing, pricing, and assortment decisions with precision.
