- en: Geographic Information Systems are seeing a new popularity in recent times partly
    thanks to the COVID-19 Outbreak that has prompted may people to use spatial analysis
    to showcase the spread of the virus. GIS has mostly been behind more popular buzzwords
    like machine learning and deep learning. GIS has always been around us in the
    background being used in government, business, medicine, real estate, transport,
    manufacturing etc.

    by their franchisor to operate their own business using the franchisor's brand.
    Using GIS analysis, franchisors can give their franchisees insights about their
    location such as a demographic profile, competitor analysis, traffic generators
    etc to market the attractiveness of franchise locations. These services can help
    businesses to have a better assessment of their site to expand while minimizing
    risk.

    spatial boundaries and these spatial files can carry valuable demographic information

    (current and future) can be mapped and have their geographic distribution identified.
    This can assist with marketing and expansion plans.

    compile, analyze and visualize spatio-temporal information for sustainable urban
    planning, development and management. GIS is deployed at every stage of planning
    and development of a Smart City. The underlying framework is served by ICT (Information
    and Communications Technologies), while the focus is on the ‘spatial’ or GIS.
    The common platform operates through all stages of the life cycle – from modeling,
    planning, building to managing – across the full spectrum of functionalities.

- en: In 2020, Public Health applications of GIS is arguably the most mainstream application
    at the moment. GIS has been used to study and visualize the spread of COVID-19
    across the globe and inform the public of what is happening. GIS was the catalyst
    for the spread of useful information for governments, businesses and the public.
    Epidemiologists are tasked with studying the spread of diseases in society and
    GIS has enabled parts of their analysis to reach the billions of people around
    the world.
