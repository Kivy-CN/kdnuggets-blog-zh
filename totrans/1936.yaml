    declared my job “sexy”. My old job title of statistician had sounded dull and
    stodgy, but then it became filled with exciting jargon: I’m a *data scientist*
    doing *predictive analytics* with (occasionally) *big data*. Three hot buzzwords
    in a single job description! However, in recent years, the powerful technology
    that has made my job so buzzworthy has me contemplating the future of the field.
    Computer programs that automatically generate complex models are becoming commonplace.

    offer the ability to generate forecasts that used to require years of training
    to develop. Similar tools are now available for other types of models as well.'

    eliminated through automation, I probably would have said: [brain wave analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography).
    It had far more steps involved than any other type of work I did. We were measuring
    the electrical activity of many parts of the brain, at many frequencies, thousands
    of times per second. An analysis that simply compared two groups would take many
    weeks of full-time work. Surprisingly, this was the first part of my job to be
    eliminated. However, our statistical consulting team supports many different departments,
    so I didn’t really notice when work stopped arriving from the EEG Lab. Years later
    I got a call from the new lab director offering to introduce me to my replacement:
    a “robot” named [LORETA](http://www.uzh.ch/keyinst/loreta.htm).'

    electrodes. EEG paste (essentially K-Y jelly) was squirted into a hole in each
    electrode to ensure a good contact and the machine began recording my brain waves.
    I used bio-feedback to generate alpha waves which made a car go around a track
    in a simple video game. Your brain creates alpha waves when you get into a very
    relaxed, meditative state. Moments after I finished, LORETA had already analyzed
    my brain waves. “She” had done several weeks of analysis in just a few moments.

    the time. I was too busy using the time LORETA freed up to learn image analysis
    using [ImageJ](http://imagej.net/Welcome), text mining using [WordStat](http://provalisresearch.com/products/content-analysis-software/)
    and [SAS Text Miner](http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/analytics/text-miner.html),

    career, 90% of the time was spent “battling” computers. They were incredibly difficult
    to operate. Today someone may send you a data file and you’ll be able to see the
    data moments after receiving it. In 1980 data arrived on tapes, and every computer
    manufacturer used a different tape format, each in numerous incompatible variations.
    Unless you had a copy of the program that created a tape, it might take days of
    tedious programming just to get the data off of it. Even asking the computer to
    run a program required error-prone [Job Control Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Control_Language).
    So from that perspective, easier-to-use computing technology has already eliminated
    90% of what my job used to be. It wasn’t the interesting part of the job, so it
    was a change for the better.

    by developing a LORETA for every problem that needs to be solved? Will we just
    be letting our Star-Trek-class computers and robots do our work for us while we
    lounge around [self-actualizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization)?
    Perhaps some day, but I doubt it will happen any time soon!
