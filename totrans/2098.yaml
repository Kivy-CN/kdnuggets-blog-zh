    For example, when talking about Large Language Models, consider breaking them
    into each component – “Large, Language, and Models”, and analyze the meaning behind
    each of them. Starting with largeness – understand whether it is about the largeness
    of the training data or concerns model parameters.

    the conversion of sentences to a vector of numbers. This is where the knowledge
    of Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP) comes to the rescue. Further,
    learning a language is challenging, as it involves identifying intonation, sarcasm,
    and different sentiments. There are situations where the same word can have different
    meanings in different contexts, emphasizing the importance of contextual learning.
  prefs: []

- en: Then, there are considerations, such as, how far into a sentence is the context,
    and how a model knows the context window. Going a level deeper, isn’t this how
    humans pick context by paying attention to specific words or parts of sentences?

    Building these foundations helps develop a mind map, shaping an approach to a

    to learn a concept. However, that is where the problem lies. Try internalizing
    a concept by studying it from multiple resources. Chances are high that you would
    understand a concept better if you learned it from multiple viewpoints rather
    than just consuming it as a theoretical concept.

    tasks. However, if the business case demands domain-specific context, then the
    model must be provided with sufficient context to give a relevant and accurate
    response. For example, expecting an LLM to respond to a company’s annual report
    requires additional context, which can be done by leveraging Retrieval Augmented
    Generation (RAGs).

    it is suggested that businesses first develop trust with the technology by trying
    low-hanging projects, that allow them to see the results quickly. For example,
    picking initiatives that are not directly customer-facing or deal with sensitive
    data issues is good to start with, so that their downside can be controlled timely
    if the solution goes rogue.

    them in their day-to-day tasks such as writing code. Hence, it is important to
    consider whether you can rely on such code, as they could potentially make mistakes,
    such as writing oversimplified code, or not covering all edge cases. The suggested
    code might even be incomplete or too complex for the use case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, it is always advised to use the LLM output as a starting point and iterate
    over it to meet the requirements. Test it on different cases, review it yourself,
    pass it through peer review, and refer to some established and trusted resources
    to validate the code. It's crucial to thoroughly analyze the model output to ensure
    there are no security vulnerabilities and verify that the code aligns with best
    practices. Testing the code in a safe environment can help identify potential
    issues.
