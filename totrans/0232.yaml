    age, and other factors is good for business. Diverse teams perform better and
    are more innovative. The technology industry, specifically, has been continuing
    to close the gender gap. [Deloitte Global](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2022/statistics-show-women-in-technology-are-facing-new-headwinds.html)
    predicts that large global technology firms, on average, will reach nearly 33
    percent overall female representation in their workforces in 2022, up slightly
    more than two percentage points from 2019\. The proportion of women in other industry
    roles will also presumably nudge up as well.

- en: Parul Bharadwaj, a seasoned technology professional based in Seattle, WA, who
    has worked with tech giants such as Amazon and DoorDash Inc., says she is very
    encouraged by opportunities that lie ahead for women as technology companies continue
    to renew their commitment to advancing gender diversity. Currently employed as
    a senior technical program manager at DoorDash, Bharadwaj leads engineering-wide
    initiatives such as data infrastructure, real-time streaming, rollouts, experimentation,
    analytics, data compliance, and governance. She said she finds inspiration at
    DoorDash, where female leaders such as Liangxiao Zhu, vice president of engineering;
    Sophia Vicent, senior director of engineering operations; Avani Nanavati, technical
    product director; and Varsha Dudani, director of engineering, display the potential
    for women to hold key decision-making positions. “I commend DoorDash for its efforts
    to expand women’s roles,” Bharadwaj said. “When hiring for leadership positions,
    research shows that the percentage of female candidates with required experience
    is low, but DoorDash is tactically addressing this problem by hiring women in
    management, thereby giving women the opportunity to gain experience today to lead
    as executives tomorrow.”

    DoorDash 担任高级技术项目经理的 Bharadwaj 领导着工程全局性项目，如数据基础设施、实时流媒体、发布、实验、分析、数据合规和治理。她表示，在
    DoorDash 找到灵感，在这里，女性领导者如 Liangxiao Zhu（工程副总裁）、Sophia Vicent（工程运营高级总监）、Avani Nanavati（技术产品总监）和
    Varsha Dudani（工程总监）展示了女性担任关键决策职位的潜力。Bharadwaj 说：“我赞扬 DoorDash 扩大女性角色的努力。研究表明，担任领导职位的女性候选人拥有所需经验的比例较低，但
    DoorDash 正通过在管理层招聘女性来战术性地解决这个问题，从而给女性提供今天积累经验、明天担任高管的机会。”

    that led me to this field.” She continues to see herself as someone who is part
    of enabling a massive growth of key online platforms that continue to make an

    being made throughout industry as well. According to Bharadwaj, “when you hire
    a diverse workforce, you must also be sensitive to and be able to recognize differences
    among those employees. Listening to people who have different life and career
    experiences reduces the likelihood of falling into group-think patterns.” It's
    just reality today. Innovative companies must have people at the table with different
    backgrounds. In this way, organizations harness excellence as they reshape the
