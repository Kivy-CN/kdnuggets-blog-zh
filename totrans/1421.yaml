- en: The gender gap refers to the differences men and women experience related to
    what they can or want to attain in the labor market. One of the most common ways
    people speak about this issue is by bringing up how women often don't earn as
    much as men, even when they assume similar roles.

- en: But the gender gap can also extend to the lack of equal representation in certain
    industries or career paths. There's an extraordinarily long way to go before people
    will be on equal footing in the labor market. Fortunately, human resources (HR)
    professionals can rely on data analytics to make progress.

- en: 1\. Artificial Intelligence Can Remove Some Sources of Bias
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evidence suggests that [artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise](https://hbr.org/2019/10/using-ai-to-eliminate-bias-from-hiring) for
    getting rid of bias that may crop up in hiring practices. For example, a company's
    hiring history may make it biased. U.S. federal law states that it's okay [for
    an HR professional to use a tool](https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/factemployment_procedures.html) that
    applies a job-related selection process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, the tool might look at the characteristics that made a person
    succeed in a role, then cause an HR professional to repeatedly choose professionals
    who fit into those parameters. Problems can result, for example, if it just so
    happens that the majority of people who excelled in their roles were white men.
    Did that happen because they genuinely were better than others, or because the
    system never gave minorities a chance?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI would not be a perfect solution. It, too, can show bias, mainly because human
    programming is at the heart of what makes AI work, and people aren't wholly non-judgmental.
    But with experimentation and hard work dedicated to improving AI algorithms, we
    may someday eliminate many of the types of unconscious bias in the workplace and
    hiring process.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's often said that people can't start to fix a problem until they're aware
    of it. So what if an HR professional has an overall impression that they work
    at a company without a massive gender gap problem, but the belief is incorrect?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This scenario could feasibly happen if an HR worker tends to regularly interact
    with an equal number of male- and female-identifying individuals. But there could
    be a substantial gender imbalance seen in other departments or shown by people
    who don't often deal with the HR department.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data analytics platform can show useful statistics, such as the gender breakdown
    in particular parts of the company or the percentage of females in leadership
    roles at a company. Then, HR teams can understand if gender problems exist. If
    data analytics platforms uncover such issues, people can see where the problems
    lie, then get to work addressing them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without the concrete information that data analysis programs provide — or in
    the absence of people complaining about a gender gap in a particular workplace
    — HR professionals may never realize how severe the issue is or that it's there
    at all.

- en: As mentioned in the introduction, people often discuss the gender gap by citing
    wage discrepancies. For example, statistics revealed the earnings of corporate
    compliance officers. They showed that female compliance professionals [earn 76%
    less](https://www.barkergilmore.com/blog/the-compliance-officers-guide-to-2019-compensation-trends)
    than their male counterparts.

    of sources quoted online by Canadian news outlets. It keeps track of each instance
    in near real-time. Unfortunately, considering that the results showed [women never
    mentioned more](https://troymedia.com/viewpoint/big-data-analytics-gender-gap/)
    than 26% of the time, there's a great deal of progress to make.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even when HR professionals are lucky enough to work in organizations that strive
    to offer equal pay regardless of gender and feature women's perspectives regularly,
    the data-driven examples above could help them learn which mistakes not to make
    by showing them what's happening in society at large.

- en: When companies work to increase diversity, they often narrow the gender gap
    in the process. Of course, hiring more people of the less dominant gender to work
    at a firm is only one way to boost diversity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An enterprise could also change by hiring people from other cultures or countries,
    individuals who are disabled or professionals of a wide variety of ages. HR professionals
    should still see the connection between diversity and gender balance though.

    the results had a positive impact on diversity. But becoming more diverse was
    not the primary goal of the company. Instead, it hoped that Gallup Analytics could
    help find more top-tier managers, or so called "A-level talent."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to a tweaked process that applied predictive analytics early in and throughout
    the process, U.S. Bank found more of those desirable candidates in five weeks
    than it had during a year of using the old method. Concerning diversity, there
    was a 17% overall increase in diverse new hires and a 74% uptick in diverse top
    managers.

    more hopeful that the gender imbalance is a conquerable problem. They're only
    a glimpse of the options, but these applications could keep people motivated to
    work for positive changes in hiring and improve related aspects like wages and
    available positions.
