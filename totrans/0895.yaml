    insights and driving smarter decisions with the help of big data. This doesn't
    come as much of a surprise these days -- the ability to gather, categorize, and
    analyze big sets of data is immensely useful when it comes to [making data-driven
    business decisions](/2019/04/psu-make-better-data-driven-business-decisions.html).

    their fair share of errors, and these errors don't do anyone any favors when it

    you first need to make sure that data cleansing is at the top of your to-do list

    most of them have their fair share of flaws and simply don't work the way you'd
