    need into picking up machine learning, but many (most?) of them take the long
    view: get a foundation first, learn the basics next, then learn a bit of complementary
    theory before getting too far ahead of yourself in practical terms, take a step
    back, try your hand at a few examples, undertake a project on your own... This
    is all great advice, and a great approach to learning... well, almost anything.'

    have the patience to go through all of the motions. Let's say you want to hit
    the ground running and scramble under pressure to learn everything right now.
    The best approach? Ideally, no, but I'm in no position to judge. I work best under
    pressure, and can sympathize with the impatient among us who just want to get
    on with things.

    With learning machine learning -- much as with machine learning itself -- there
    is no free lunch. However, getting a practical overview for the purposes of testing
    the waters and deciding whether learning more about the topic is what you are
    after, or if you already posses a solid theoretical understanding of much of these
    (or related) concepts, the way of the guerrilla may be for you.'

    Python, a complete course for the quick study hacker with no time (or patience)
    to spare.

    library, getting a solid look at data preparation with the library is essential
    enough to spend some time learning it well. Watch Jonathan Rocher's SciPy 2016
    tutorial on this very subject.

    with Scikit-learn, watch Andreas Mueller and Sebastian Raschka''s tutorial in

    deep learning, and gives treatment of both convolutional and recurrent neural
    network architectures, all with an emphasis on the practical. See the video of
    the talk below, and check out the [corresponding code lab here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist/#0)
    (covers convolutional neural networks).

    machine learning in a few days. It's not a complete course, however; understanding
    the underlying statistical building blocks of machine learning takes years, and
    becoming proficient in the practical will take hundreds of hours of doing. However,
    no one said you can't get your hands dirty and have some introductory fun on the
    way to perfecting a new craft.
