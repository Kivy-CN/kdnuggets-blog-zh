    of what I did to get to where I am today. I’m not suggesting that you will achieve
    the same thing by following the same steps, but I figured that this might provide
    you with a unique perspective that you might not have thought about before.

    Bitcoin in an attempt to “get rich quick,” but as Warren Buffett said, the best
    investment you can make is in yourself. This is especially true for those who
    don’t have money to invest but want to better their finances.

    area that reaped me the most benefits. From my experiences, the most amount of
    time is spent querying data, exploring data, and wrangling data, all of which
    require SQL and Pandas. Of all of my data-related jobs (growth marketing analyst,
    data analyst, data scientist), SQL has been the common denominator and is arguably
    the most important skill for a data professional.

    I always recommend this as a resource because it serves as a great guideline for

    I won’t get into too much detail, but the main idea behind “exploration and exploitation”
    is deciding whether to *explore* and find new potential ideas or to *exploit* ideas
    that you already know that works.

    potentially trying new writing styles.
