    and operation of charging stations and is essential for several critical reasons.
    Firstly, accurate demand prediction allows for the strategic placement of charging
    stations. By forecasting when and where charging needs will be highest, AI-driven
    systems can optimize the geographic distribution of charging infrastructure. This
    ensures that charging stations are conveniently located in areas with anticipated
