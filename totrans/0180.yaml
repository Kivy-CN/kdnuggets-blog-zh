- en: We are seeing rapid development of ChatGPT [open-source alternatives](/2023/04/8-opensource-alternative-chatgpt-bard.html),
    but no one is working on the GPT-4 alternative, which provides multimodality.
    GPT-4 is an advanced and powerful multimodal model that accepts images and text
    as input and outputs text response. It can solve complex problems with greater
    accuracy and learn from its mistakes.

    GPT-4 that can understand both visual and textual context while being lightweight.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to GPT-4, MiniGPT-4 can exhibit detailed image description generation,
    write stories using images, and create a website using the hand-drawn user interface.
    It achieves that by utilization of a more advanced large language model (LLM).

    Large Language Models](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4/blob/main/MiniGPT_4.pdf)
    found that pre-training on raw image-text pairs could produce poor results that
    lack coherency, including repetition and fragmented sentences. To counter this
    issue, they curated a high-quality, well-aligned dataset and fine-tuned the model
    using a conversational template.'

    only a projection layer utilizing approximately 5 million aligned image-text pairs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MiniGPT-4 aligns a frozen visual encoder with a frozen LLM called Vicuna using
    just one projection layer. The visual encoder consists of pretrained ViT and Q-Former
    models that are connected to an advanced Vicuna large language model via a single
    linear projection layer.

    with Vicuna. So, it is lightweight, requires less computational resources, and
    produces similar results to GPT-4.

    you will see that the authors have created a website by uploading the hand-drawn
    UI and asking it to write an HTML/JS website. The MiniGPT-4 understood the context
    and generated HTML, CSS, and JS code. It is amazing.
