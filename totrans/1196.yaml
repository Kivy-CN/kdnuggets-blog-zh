    prosper. Since data scientists’ entire work revolves around potentially sensitive
    data, they face more pressure than most. If you suffer a data breach, you may
    be unable to perform your job, in addition to potential financial and reputational
    losses.

    on average. Depending on the severity of the incident, it could also cost your
    reputation or even your job. With that in mind, here are seven data security best
    practices to adopt this year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**1\. Use Only What You Need**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best ways to secure your data is to minimize what you store. While
    it’s tempting to collect as much data as possible, especially when training machine
    learning models, this makes you more vulnerable. You can only lose what you have,
    so go through your databases and get rid of anything that isn’t necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Part of this principle is keeping an updated record of the data you have on
    hand. If you get to a point where you no longer need some information, purge it
    from your database. Holding on to legacy data doesn’t help you and only means
    you have more to lose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**2\. Mask Sensitive Data**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The “use only what you need” principle applies to the type of data you store,
    too. Many data science operations don’t require user-specific information, so
    don’t store it if you don’t need it. If you must use sensitive data like personal
    identifiers, you should mask it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most common ways to mask sensitive data is to use a substitution
    cipher. Tokenization, which [substitutes real values with dummy data](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/sensitive-data-and-ml-datasets#masking_sensitive_data),
    is another option and generally safer, as it places the encrypted values in a
    separate database. No matter which method you use, make sure you scrub your data
    of all sensitive info that isn’t necessary first.
  prefs: []

- en: '**3\. Collaborate Carefully**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science is often a collaborative process, and you should think about how
    you communicate with collaborators. While email may be convenient, it [isn’t encrypted
    by default](https://www.kaseware.com/cybersecurity-awareness-month/), so it’s
    unsuitable for sharing data or credentials to access databases. There are many
    available services made specifically for sensitive file-sharing, so these are
    a better option.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should also keep trust to a minimum, no matter who you’re working with.
    People should only be able to access what’s critical for their job. You may even
    consider obfuscating information before sharing it, if possible, to mitigate the
    impact of any potential breaches.
  prefs: []

- en: '**4\. Encrypt as Much as Possible**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you do share data, you should encrypt it. You should also encrypt your
    data when it’s sitting in your database. While encryption isn’t a cure-all for
    all your security concerns, it’s a low-cost way to add another layer of protection.

    today won’t slow your processes much, either. Look through your options to find
    something that can encrypt your data at rest and in motion in all scenarios. While
    this won’t necessarily stop breaches from happening, it will mitigate their cost.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that security applies to more than just where you store your data.
    Your databases should be the area you pay the most attention to, but they shouldn’t
    be your only concern. Backups, connected applications, and analytics servers can
    all serve as backdoors to your data, so they need protection too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any program, drive, or file that touches your data should be secure. As you
    work on this, it’s easier when your data has fewer connections. Minimizing the
    things that have access to your databases makes your job easier and offers more
    protection.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you use a third-party cloud like AWS, be careful not to become complacent
    with security. Unfortunately, many users do, as a recent study revealed that [82%
    of companies](https://www.wiz.io/blog/82-of-companies-unknowingly-give-3rd-parties-access-to-all-their-cloud-data)
    give these vendors highly privileged access. Third-party clouds are not inherently
    risky, but you do need to take security into your own hands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Check your permissions to make sure you grant the least privilege to your vendor
    and other applications. Use strong credentials, including multi-factor authentication,
    and rotate these regularly. If you don’t know what to do, many of these vendors
    [provide security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
    you can reference.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, you should establish a clear and specific governance policy for your
    whole team. Having a written document of what people should and shouldn’t do will
    help ensure safe user behavior. If someone makes a mistake that jeopardizes security,
    you can refer to the policy to see what went wrong.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your governance policy should define everybody’s role in security. You may have
    a rotating schedule for who monitors and documents incoming and outgoing data.
    You may give everyone a static role. Whatever you do, make it specific and clear,
    and ensure everyone understands it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science is playing an increasingly central role in business today. As this
    trend continues, your work becomes a more valuable target for cybercriminals.
    Data science teams must embrace security in light of these rising threats.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Start with these best practices, then look for other, smaller areas where you
    can increase security. When your data is secure, you can work with confidence
    and impress potential clients.
