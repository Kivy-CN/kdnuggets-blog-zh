    that arranges data in Numpy-like arrays. It integrated smoothly with deep learning
    frameworks such as Tensorflow and PyTorch for faster GPU processing and training.
    We can update the data, visualize the data, and create machine learning pipelines
    using Hub API.'

- en: Hub allows us to store images, audio, video, and time-series data in a way that
    can be accessed at lightning speed. The data can be stored on GCS/S3 buckets,
    local storage, or on Activeloop cloud. The data can directly be used in the training
    Pytorch model so that you don't need to set up data pipelines. The Hub also comes
    with data version control, dataset search queries, and distributed workloads.

    the cloud within a couple of minutes. In this blog, we are going to see how Hub
    can be used to create and manage the dataset.

    You can also earn up to 200 GBs of free storage by referring people. Activeloop's
    Hub interfaces with the Database for AI, that allows us to visualize dataset with
    labels and complex search queries allows us to analyze the data in an effective
    way. The platform also contains more than 100 datasets on image segmentation,
    classification, and object detection.

    It also converts image files into Numpy-like arrays and appends them to tensors.
    For this project, we only need two tensors, one for labels and one for image data.

    lives easy. The Hub can be integrated with AWS/GCP storage and provide a direct
    data stream for deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch. It also provides interactive
    visualization through the Activeloop cloud and version control for tracking the
    ML experiments. I think Hub will become an MLOps solution for data management
    in the future as it will solve a lot of core issues that data scientists and engineers
    face daily.
