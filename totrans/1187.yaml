    and during data science interviews. This article is the fifth article of the data
    science interview preparation series, and it will be focused on behavioral questions.
    I will first discusses how to prepare the behavioral round and then list some
    frequently asked questions for you to practice the techniques.

- en: I like the behavioral round the most in the interview process because it is
    quite relaxing compared to other technical rounds. Before I know any strategies
    for answering behavioral questions, I always felt like I was chatting with someone
    about interesting experiences I have had during this round. Although a less stressful
    mindset is something nice to have during an interview, an over-relaxing altitude
    may not help you impress the interviewers. I ended up talking too many details
    and lost the chance of proving I have what the interviewers were looking for.
    Keep in mind that even though you are mostly chatting with the interviewers, you
    are still evaluated through the conversations in this round. It would be best
    if you took this round as the opportunity to show your interviewers that you are
    the best candidate for this position based on your experience and personality.
    You cannot efficiently represent yourself without solid examples and established
    structures, which I will discuss in this article.

- en: The content of your answers to behavior questions is the foundation. During
    the interview, to keep the conversation fluent, you rarely have any time to think
    of the perfect example to answer the question. Thus, when preparing the interview,
    we should start by collecting all the “useful” experiences and categorizing them
    by what types of questions can they be used to answer. In this way, you know you
    will always have something to talk about, and have the right examples to support
    your arguments. In this section, I will discuss the process of collecting solid
    examples.

    brainstorm experiences I have had. Although questions can be asked in millions
    of ways, we can generalize them into the following eight categories. What are
    the challenges you have met? How do you prioritize your work? What are the accomplishments
    you want to share? What are the examples that show your leadership skills? When
    did you have conflicts and how did you deal with them? What are the mistakes you
    have made? How do you adapt to a new environment, how do you fit in?

    If you have over one examples for each category, great! Write them all down and
    emphasize them in different aspects. For example, for the same category showing
    your accomplishments, you may find one example that emphasizes on your self-learning
    skills and another one showing that you are a team player. They are all outstanding
    qualities that interviewers may look for. Collect them all and learn how to prioritize
    the one to share based on the context of the question during interviews.

    You can talk about an individual research project you have worked on; how did
    you collaborate with advisors, who are like the supervisors in workforce; how
    did you work with other graduate students, who are like the coworkers in workforce.
    If you have worked as a teaching assistant, even though the job itself might be
    irrelevant to what you are applying for right now, you can still talk about some
    experience that shows your communication and leadership skills.

    someone else every day in the future. Rather than making up examples, try to think
    through the experience you have had, and dig into details. When I was looking
    for my first full-time position, I had some hard time proving my ability of working
    in the workforce to some interviewers. I emphasized a lot on my internship experience
    at a startup, especially the parts when I worked with my supervisor and coworkers
    from different teams. This experience gives me a lot of examples I can use to
    prove my communication and leadership skills, and show interviewers I can perform
    well in a fast-paced working environment. This is also why we need to go deep
    and make the best use of all the examples we have as discussed above.'

    then you can talk in more details. As discussed before, be honest about what you
    know and what you do not know. If you pretend you have done something or know
    something in details, interviewers might ask follow up questions and find you
    are lying. That’s a terrible signal.

    I do not mean for you to write down the answers and read through it, hoping to
    get the exact same question during the interview. Rather, practice answering questions
    with an established structure. Moreover, practice it in front of a mirror or with
    a partner so you would get some feedbacks. Keep in mind that during the interview,
    you are not making a speech but having conversations with others. Thus, it is
    very important to actively listening, and watching out to others’ reactions in
    the meantime. I know it might be more challenging during virtual interviews, I
    have an article [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-be-better-prepared-for-virtual-data-science-interviews-7650c4492d65) helps
    you better prepare for virtual interviews. The goal is to have a great conversation
    so that you should focus on answering the question rather than providing the “perfect
    answer”.
