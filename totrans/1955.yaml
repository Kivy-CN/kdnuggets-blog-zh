    who brought the web to life were jack-of-all-trade technologists that went by

    of skills: system administration, network administration, programming, interface
    design, and graphic design, to name a few. Webmasters typically worked alone,
    or among a small cadre of webmasters, to accomplish an organization''s web-based

    has become a large part of essentially every organization on the planet, and there
    are massive numbers of businesses whose sole purpose is to monetize the web. The
    web has brought in databases, it spurs the development of new technologies, it
    pushes the envelope for interactive user-interface design, and certain essential
    services have been commoditized to the point of triviality. The scope and maturity
    of today's web is so big that having a jack-of-all-trades webmaster is no longer
    practical. For people working in web-based enterprises, each of those webmastery
    skills I mentioned above (and more) have been parceled out as discrete disciplines
    to specialists. While an interface designer might know a thing or two about how
    SOAP works -- and would be a better interface designer for it -- they're not going
    to be working on the back-end programming with an API. They'll leave that to the

    of effort. They need to have that team of specialists.

    scientists. If "data science" as a field is expected to evolve and mature to an
    industrial scale, then "data science" will outgrow the data scientist, and of
    course you will see specialization, typically in the form of project teams, and
    I'm seeing this already in large data-driven organizations. People have natural
    skill mixes, and they gravitate to those responsibilities that cater to their
    strengths, and for a large organization practicing in data science, having a project
    team composed of people with distinct responsibilities will result in a more-efficient
    workflow and a better end product, and it's easier to manage. It's a more natural
    and disciplined way of doing business.

    When recruiting, I'm looking for individuals who can fill the holes in the team,

    without the curiosity and creativity of a miner, or without the ability to pickup
    business knowledge and interpret the outcomes of their analysis, or the ability
    to distill their insights into powerful presentations. I think it depends on the

    the occasional domain expert.

    argue for a very small team of 2-3 people But having the skills reside in 10 individuals
    say doesn't do it for me. Its about the way you pull together various disparate

    a single individual needs two of three. Of my time in data analytics (April 2000),

    to evolve at what sometimes seems an exponential rate, in my opinion a team approach
    would be preferred by most companies (although not by all). Thus, bringing together
    the right DS team to work on a specific project/problem/opportunity. The team
    of DS may be comprised of individuals with complementary depth in one or two areas
    and an understanding of the others, so as a team they would have both breadth
    and depth of knowledge -- which I don't think is achievable in a single DS (although
    I have met some individuals who believe they have both breadth and depth in all
    fields, including nascent fields -- not everyone agreed with their self assessment).
    However, as with most things, the approach depends on many assumptions/realities
    including complexity of the problem, size of company, availability of talent within
    the company, etc., etc.
