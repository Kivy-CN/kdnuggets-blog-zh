    data engineer was the fastest-growing tech occupation in 2019, with a 50% year-over-year
    growth in the number of open job positions. As data engineering is a relatively
    new job category, I often get questions about what I do from people who are interested
    in pursuing it as a career. In this blog post, I will share my own story of becoming
    a data engineer and answer some frequently asked questions about data engineering.

    database and application development (plus scale and performance testing). I loved
    working with [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) and data
    so much that I decided to pursue an engineering career that focuses on Big Data.
    After researching online, I learned about a type of job I had never heard of before,
    but thought might be the “Mr. Right” for me: data engineer. I was lost at the
    time because I did not know where to start or whether this would work out for
    me. However, I was lucky enough to have a mentor who showed me the ropes and helped
    me land my first data engineering job. Since then, I have been working full time
    in the field and am still loving it!'

    real-time data pipelines to integrate data between systems and support the [data
    warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse). Since the data warehouse
    is meant for tackling business problems, data warehouse engineers usually work

    at Lyft built a data discovery tool called [Amundsen](https://github.com/lyft/amundsen),
    which was open-sourced in 2019.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data warehouse is a data storage system filled with data from various sources
    and is mainly used for data analysis. A company’s data is often stored in different
    transactional systems (or even worse, as text files), and transactional data is
    highly normalized and suboptimal for analytics. The main reason for building a
    data warehouse is to store all types of data in optimized formats in a centralized
    place so that data scientists can analyze this data altogether. There are many
    databases that serve well as a data warehouse, such as [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) (GCP),
    and [RedShift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) (AWS).

    data between different systems. There are two main types of data pipelines: batch-driven
    and real-time:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Batch-driven**: Batch data pipelines only process data at a certain frequency
    and are often scheduled by a data orchestration tool, such as [Airflow](https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-xinran-waibel-build-data-pipelines-with-apache-airflow-808a4de79047), [Oozie](https://towardsdatascience.com/lesser-known-tips-on-apache-oozie-1e9bee9169da),
    or [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). They usually process a large batch
    of historical data all at once, therefore taking a long time to finish and inducing
    more data delay at the end system. For example, a batch-based data pipeline downloads
    the previous day’s data from an API at 12 AM every day, transforms the data, and
    then loads it into a data warehouse.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Real-time**: Real-time data pipelines process new data as soon as it is available,
    and there is almost no delay between the source and end system. The architecture
    for real-time data processing is very different from that of batched pipelines
    because data is treated as a stream of events instead of chunks of records. For
    example, to rebuild the pipeline mentioned above into a real-time pipeline, an
    event streaming tool like [Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/what-is-apache-kafka/) is
    needed: a [Kafka Connector](https://www.confluent.io/connectors/) will stream
    data from the API into a Kafka topic, and a [Kafka Streams](https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/index.html) (or [Kafka
    Producer](https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/producer.html)) process will
    perform the transformation on the raw data from the Kafka topic and load the transformed
    data into another Kafka topic. The delay between the source API and the destination
    Kafka topic may be within a second!'

    each company is leveraging different tools for its data platform. Therefore, I
    recommend you first learn the foundation knowledge for each core skill, then pick
    a popular tool to learn in-depth and understand the trade-offs between what you
    picked and the other tools out there. To get to the next level, you also need
    to know how all the tools work together in a data architecture.
