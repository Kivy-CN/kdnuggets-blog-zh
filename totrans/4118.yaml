  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Web scraping is the extraction of data (primarily unstructured data) from a
    website, usually in large quantities. Once collected, this information is exported
    into a usable, structured format such as a spreadsheet or an Application Programming
    Interface (API).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be done manually for small datasets; however, it’s best to use automated
    systems to handle large volumes of data as it is quicker and less costly.
  prefs: []

- en: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to [web scraping](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/what-is-web-scraping/),
    as all websites come in different sizes and forms. Each site can provide various
    obstacles that need to be navigated, such as Captcha challenge-response tests,
    which is why web scrapers need to be very versatile.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is a general-purpose computer programming language that can be used for
    various tasks, from building websites and software to automating specific tasks
    and even machine learning. It is compatible with almost any type of program and
    wasn’t developed for any single objective.

    project.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python has a large number of libraries that can be repurposed for your project
    (a library is a section of code that anyone can use to be included in their own
    programs). Python libraries [include pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), Matplotlib,
    Numpy, and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These libraries can be used for many different functions and are perfect for
    data manipulation and web crawling projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Python Is Relatively Simple
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is one of the simplest programming languages to get to grips with as
    it doesn’t use symbols such as semicolons and curly brackets, making the code
    less convoluted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Python Is Dynamic
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python can be dynamically typed, meaning you do not need to define any data
    types for variables within Python. Instead, you can insert them whenever needed,
    making the process much quicker.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of web scraping is to save time and [collect data quickly](/2022/04/design-experiments-data-collection.html),
    but this isn’t much good if writing the code is a lengthy process. Python, however,
    is streamlined and only requires a small amount of code to achieve the user’s
    goal.

- en: 5\. Python Syntax Can Be Learned Quickly
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python syntax (the rules determining how the code will be written) is very straightforward
    to learn compared to other programming languages. Each scope or block is easily
    distinguishable within the code, which makes it easy to follow, even for beginners.

    the program can use. These are Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium.

    HTML files to extract data. When scraping a website, the requests library must
    be used to send website requests and receive responses. The HTML is then extracted
    and delivered to the Beautiful Soup object for parsing.'

    that Python uses, effectively crawling websites and extracting structured data.
    It can be used for numerous tasks, including data mining, web monitoring, and
    automated testing. Scrapy is HTML focused and works by simply specifying a URL.'

    (Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites, for example). It can also scrape
    websites that require a login or registration.'

    and manipulation library Pandas. This library is used to extract the data and
    then save it in the user’s preferred format.
