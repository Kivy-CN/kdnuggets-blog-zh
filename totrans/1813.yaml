    that "Data science is both synonymous with data mining, as well as a superset
    of concepts which **includes** data mining." Since this post will focus on the
    different types of patterns which can be **mined** from data, let's turn our attention
    to **data mining**.

    classification and regression (together: predictive analysis); cluster analysis;
    frequent pattern mining; and outlier analysis. There are all sorts of other ways
    you could break down data mining functionality as well, I suppose, e.g. focusing
    on algorithms, starting with supervised versus unsupervised learning, etc. However,
    this is a reasonable and accepted approach to identifying what data mining is
    able to accomplish, and as such these problems are each covered below, with a
    focus on what can be solved with each "problem."'

    in which prediction is carried out as relates to data with class labels. Classification
    involves finding a model which describes data classes, which can then be used
    to classify instances of unknown data. The concept of [training data versus testing
    data](/2016/09/data-science-basics-3-insights-beginners.html) is of integral importance
    to classification.

    a model, while stories of unknown classes are then used to test the model, with

    quite literally, endless.

    of supervised learning and is useful for predictive analysis. They differ in that
    classification is used for predictions of data with distinct finite classes, while
    regression is used for predicting continuous numeric data. As a form of supervised
    learning, training/testing data is an important concept in regression as well.

    is used for analyzing data which does not include pre-labeled classes. Data instances
    are grouped together using the concept of maximizing intraclass similarity and
    minimizing the similarity between differing classes. This translates to the clustering
    algorithm identifying and grouping instances which are very similar, as opposed
    to ungrouped instances which are much less-similar to one another. As clustering
    does not require the pre-labeling of classes, it is a form of unsupervised learning.'

    documents of unknown authors to be clustered together based on their content style,
    and (hopefully), as a result, their authors - or, at least, by similar authors.
    In marketing, clustering can be of particular use in identifying distinct groups
    of customer bases, allowing for targeting based on what techniques may be known
    to have worked with other similar customers in said groups.

    of instances which are not explicitly separated categorically, but which may "naturally"
    exhibit similar sets of characteristics: a collection of data describing types
    of animals (# of legs, eye position, covering); extensive data about numerous
    types of proteins; genetic info describing individuals of a wide array of ethnic
    backgrounds. All of these situations (and many more) could benefit from allowing
    unsupervised clustering algorithms find which instances are similar to one another,

    is a concept that has been used for a very long time to describe an aspect of
    data mining that many would argue is the very essence of the term data mining:
    taking a set of data and applying statistical methods to find interesting and
    previously-unknown patterns within said set of data. We aren''t looking to classify
    instances or perform instance clustering; we simply want to learn patterns of
    subsets which emerge within a dataset and across instances, which ones emerge
    frequently, which items are associated, and which items correlate with others.
    It''s easy to see why the above terms become conflated.'

    which is the identification of subsets of finite superset of products that are
    purchased together with some level of both absolute and correlative frequency.
    This concept can be generalized beyond the purchase of items; however, the underlying
    principle of item subsets remains unchanged.

    other data mining "problems," and is often not considered on its own, for a few
    specific reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, and most importantly to this discussion, outlier analysis is not its
    own method of mining as are the other problems above, but instead can actually
    use the above methods for its own goals (it's an end, as opposed to a means).
    Second, outlier analysis can also be approached as an exercise in descriptive
    statistics, which some would argue is not data mining at all (holding that data
    mining consists of, by definition, predictive statistical methods). However, in
    the interests of being exhaustive, it has been included here.

    or can be modified to explicitly discard them, there are times when outliers themselves
    are where the money is.'

    as identification of fraudulent activity. Regularly use your credit card in and
    around New York and on online, mostly for insignificant purchases? Used it at
    a coffee shop this AM in Soho, had dinner on the Upper West Side, but spent several
    thousand dollars "in person" on electronics equipment in Paris sometime in between?
    There's your outlier, and these are pursued relentlessly using a wide variety
    of mining and simple descriptive techniques.
