    do not really depend on the number of years of experience. You can lead the data
    science teams at any age as long as you understand the business objectives and
    align them with the team’s expectations and interests.

    to push the work to you.

- en: Your ability to make your stakeholders ML-aware will take you farther in this
    career. It shows that you are able to think long-term and are able to bridge the
    gap between churning models with high accuracy vs building the models that add
    tangible business value. Let us all be honest that the machine learning model
    building process is time and resource expensive and needs a clear understanding
    of the opportunity size and impact of ML models.
  prefs: []

- en: While presenting your proposal to the leaders, you should clearly lay down the
    assumptions, pros, and cons of using ML for the use case, the vulnerabilities
    of the model, etc. It takes off a huge load from the business executives and brings
    synergies and trust to the data science team.

- en: So you have convinced the management with the value proposition of your solution
    but a data science manager is also tasked with gauging the pulse of the team.
    There is a perception that a data science team gets to work on and with new state-of-the-art
    cutting-edge models all day long. But the reality also includes building automation
    workflows for repeat tasks, working on a proof of concept for 4 months only to
    see it scraped off, model monitoring, and maintenance, explaining model predictions,
    etc. to name a few.
  prefs: []

- en: The essence is you need to identify the align the interests of your team - some
    may be from a core research background and can think through innovative solutions
    while others might be interested in being a full-stack data scientist aka all-rounder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Always remember that the work that is appearing to be a burden for one of your
    team members (could be because they have done it long enough and aspire to challenge
    themselves with something new) might be a good opportunity to learn and upskill
    for someone else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Its all about finding the coherence that comes with the often underrated skill
    of knowing your team well. Do not maintain a mechanical aka transactional relationship
    with your team where you are only communicating the tasks and not incorporating
    their expectations from work.

- en: Truth be told - you can not get a team to work for a long time on a task they
    are not interested in. But you still have to finish the task. A good data science
    manager will note the interests of all the team members and should be able to
    truthfully explain the reality. But what's the reality?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That the management understands and plans an individual’s development and growth
    charter where business objectives converge with the team’s goals and interests.
    But presently we need to finish a business deliverable and whenever the next opportunity
    arises, the team’s alignment will be worked out as raised by them in one-on-ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to be utterly faithful to your commitments with the team as you are
    working with brilliant minds in the industry. You can only onboard them by making
    them understand that the successful completion of current tasks will take them
    a step closer to their areas of interest.

- en: Note that we are not living in an ideal world, so chances are high that you
    might not be able to meet the expectations of the entire team at once. You are
    working under the constraints that are implicitly called out loud and clear -
    business first. So, what will you do then?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s where the concept of emphatic leadership comes from. Your awareness of
    the team’s expectations and willingness to help them accomplish those is a testament
    to your management skills already. The efforts in the right direction are well-recognized
    by the team. Those who are yet to receive their share of the pie also understand
    that given the right time and opportunity, the manager will position and enable
    them to achieve their foreground

    this motivation under the name of healthy competition. I rather choose to respect
    every individual for their own uniqueness and tap onto their potential.

- en: Yes, everyone should be agile enough to learn and deliver fast. But this deliverable
    can very well come from their area of interest, rather than forcing them to walk
    in someone else’s footsteps. A good data science manager holds himself accountable
    for the team’s learning curve and promotes some buffer time to explore the work
    of their own interest. Oh, but you might think that your area of interest would
    not necessarily find a business outcome.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's where the good part of management shines through - you motivate them
    to spend 15-20% of their time exploring the new algorithm, learning a new skill
    like a programming language, etc. Essentially, giving them the wings to think
    outside the boundaries of the pure-play business context.

    to them. You can not fake yourself long when managing teams. So, it's best to
    be your genuine self and do what an effective manager does - delivering the business
    outcomes while keeping the team motivated.
