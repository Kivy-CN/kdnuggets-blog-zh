["```py\nI decided to build a static website. Can you generate HTML code for building the website? Moreover, I need to have three pages: a page with my name and a short presentation, a page with my data science projects and a page with my work experience. In addition to these pages, I want a vertical navigation menu at the left to move from a page to the other.\n```"]
