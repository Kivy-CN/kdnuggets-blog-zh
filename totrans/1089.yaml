    cloud hosting services, database access, and more can quickly amount to considerable
    costs. That can make it difficult to get started in the industry.

    on data analytics, but most individuals can’t afford that. Whether you’re working
    independently or setting up a stack for a company, you need a more affordable
    option. Here’s how you can set up your stack without spending too much.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Service providers like web hosting companies are an essential but often costly
    part of data science. Thankfully, many of them also offer free or low-cost tiers
    for entry-level users. Even industry leaders like AWS provide features like S3
    and AWS Lamba for free, with limits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You won’t be able to use all of a provider’s services in a free tier, and you
    may have limited storage or access frequency. Determine what you need for your
    projects, then compare various options to see which best fits your needs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When shopping for software tools to use, aim for web-based options over traditional,
    on-device apps. If you move most or all of your operations to the web, your physical
    device needs won’t be as high. You can then spend less on a computer, server,
    or other infrastructure because you won’t need as much storage or processing power.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you’re looking for web-based options, make sure you know how they’ll charge
    you. Many billing options for Kubernetes operations [charge per cluster per hour](https://archera.ai/blog/how-container-and-kubernetes-costs-are-generated/),
    which can quickly grow expensive. Make sure the as-a-service option won’t cost
    you more than an on-premises solution.

- en: Another way you can cut down your stack’s costs is by leaving some options out.
    Many features and processes can be expensive, but you may not need them. For example,
    web hosting often ranges [between $1,000 and $4,000](https://rehack.com/featured/choosing-a-web-hosting-service-5-factors-to-consider/),
    but you don’t necessarily need a unique domain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When reviewing your budget and goals, rethink whether you need each item on
    your list. Some features may be helpful but won’t impact your end product significantly,
    so it’s best to leave them out for now.

- en: Another aspect of data science that can incur high expenses is your database.
    Gathering your own data is slow and requires extensive infrastructure costs, and
    many publicly available databases are costly. You can avoid these costs by training
    your programs on open-source databases instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many open-source databases will give you limited access for free. Some service
    providers’ free tiers, like Supabase, will even [offer free and full access](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/my-tech-stack-on-a-budget-63bc40912f23)
    to their databases, often based on open-source options. When using these open
    databases, though, be sure to review their security and clean the data before
    processing.

- en: Finally, you can keep your costs down by tempering your ambitions. Large, groundbreaking,
    or disruptive projects will likely have complexity and storage needs beyond your
    limited budget. Focus on smaller, less intensive projects at first, planning to
    expand as you pull in more revenue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smaller projects will make the relative limited utility of free resources feel
    less restrictive. If you can hold back until you make more money to expand, free
    databases and hosting tools can take you a long way.

  prefs:

- en: Data science can be an imposing field at first, especially considering how much
    some businesses spend on it. While these expenses can grow to be astronomical,
    they don’t have to be, especially for new data science operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following these five steps will help you establish your stack without spending
    much. If you already have some tools, you may even be able to start working for
    free. You can then begin to grow your operation to move on to bigger things in
    the future.
