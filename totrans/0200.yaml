- en: As everybody was going mad about ChatGPT, out of nowhere - Google released their
    very own experimental AI-powered chatbot - Google Bard. You could see that the
    competition was heavy, and Google needed a response. But was it a response to
    ChatGPT, or was Google Bard in the making?

- en: So now we know that Google Bard is Google's response to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Let’s
    learn more about it. It has the same main quality - it is an artificial intelligence
    chatbot. It is able to respond to different queries in a conversational manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It uses information from the web, to provide high-quality responses that are
    up-to-date and easy for the user to understand. Google Bard uses a combination
    of machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide these high-quality
    yet realistic responses to the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google Bard aims to augment it into Google’s search tools along with providing
    it to businesses for automated support and other human-like interaction tasks
    that can be completed. Bing has already incorporated ChatGPT into their website,
    allowing for better search, browsing and chat in a unified experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Along with being a part of Google’s search tool, it can also be integrated
    into websites, messaging platforms, desktop and mobile applications, and more.
    This will all be available once their limited beta services are complete. You
    can see how this is possible by looking at the interactive image from Google below:'

- en: Google's Knowledge Graph is their way of connecting information. The Knowledge
    Graph cards contain relevant, context-specific information surrounding your specific
    search. Google wants Bard to work harmoniously with Knowledge Graph Cards, however,
    Bard responds to NORA question. NORA stands for No One Right Answer.
  prefs: []

- en: In order for this to work, Bard uses [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/),
    a Language Model for Dialogue Applications to better under the request/question
    whilst applying context. Bard then uses the web to draw in a variety of information
    to form an answer. This is then converted into a conversational response which
    you would typically have with a human.

- en: Two years ago, Google unveiled their Language Model for Dialogue Applications
    (LaMDA).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google’s language model, LaMDA, is built on Transformer, a neural network architecture
    that Google Research invented in 2017\. It also incorporates multimodal user intent,
    reinforcement learning, and suggestions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model was trained to read and understand words, from sentences to paragraphs.
    It would then take that understanding and find relations to make predictions on
    what word it thinks may come next. We can say that LaMDA is a statistical method
    as it predicts future words based on previous ones. This allows the chatbot to
    stimulate conversation in a flowing manner, moving from one topic to the next.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The major benefit of LaMDA is that it uses less computing power, allows for
    scalability, and provides a more effective feedback system, done by Google’s own
    internal testing.

    Google app, tapping on the chatbot icon and starting to have a conversation or
    making a request.

    applications. During this period, Google aims to fine-tune Bard’s accuracy, quality,
