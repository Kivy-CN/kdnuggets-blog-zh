    with right insights for their benefit and some organisations have the right use
    cases and they need to find out the right ingredients/data to address and accomplish
    the use case. Both approaches work and all it depends is on the overall success
    of their data strategy to meet their end business goal and purpose.

- en: Data monetisation is the new global economy and organisations old/big/small
    or start-ups will have to capture, store, process and consume intelligently. This
    has to be a continuous feedback loop data cycle. There is a plethora of tools
    and technology which can address this data cycle but the success depends upon
    organisation's direction and governance.

- en: Industry study and field experience says never to go with a big bang approach
    ('think big and start small') and always have an interim check points while establishing
    enterprise data program. Organisations should not think that having a big data/data
    lake setup or AI lab will solve all their analytics demand.

- en: It will be prosperous if companies have a data-centric architecture approach
    with overall governing body in place else, just by having data lake/hub is not
    taking companies anywhere. Data lake will have to be maintained, curated, secured
    etc. It should not just treat as an enterprise data storage solution and make
    the data stale.

    not encourage their teams taking short cuts and just look for short-sighted success
    while working with the data (if their overall vision is for a long run). I would
    like to term this process of taking data short cut steps as ***''data-jaywalking''****.*If
    companies want to perform any business intelligence, analytics or data science,
    leaders of the business units should ensure that data engineers, analysts and
    data scientists should not take any unscientific shortcuts. They should avoid
    blind spots in performing their tasks and in building AI models. Overall success
    should not be just measured by PoC or AI labs prototype results, instead it should
    be measured from at-scale deployment and impact made to the business and end users.'

    questions, involve, supervise all stages of data curation, data prep stages and
    scrutiny while establishing a robust data corpus across the organisation. This
    will form the bed rock for analytics, data science/AI model builds and deploy
    while coupling with AI model governance.

    build and gain insights. Going down the data analytics journey lane, organisations
    may face few hurdles while building and managing their set data strategy into
    action (e.g., challenges can be from architecture, data infrastructure, competencies,
    running costs, business user’s expectation, people etc.). These challenges have
    to be rectified and overcome at the earliest.
