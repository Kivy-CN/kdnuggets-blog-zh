    not limited to objective guidelines and require a more elaborative approach and
    depth based on the complexity of the business problem.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The business problem can be solved in multiple ways - you need to decide whether
    the machine learning solution is really needed or it can be solved with a simple
    heuristic? Is there already a solution that is currently serving the business
    problem? If so, you need to do a thorough analysis and understand its limitations
    and seek the machine learning solution that can best overcome them. The next step
    should be to compare the two solutions - does the proposed machine learning solution
    also come with its limitations. For example, ML solutions are probabilistic and
    might not be correct all the time. The business needs to align on such limitations
    and make a trade-off between the current and proposed solutions.

- en: Another factor that plays a crucial role is what degree of human expertise and
    intervention would still be required in an ML solution. Do we need humans in the
    loop to approve the ML model outcome or validate it still?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the ML solution seems to be the only choice to adopt for the business problem
    cognizant of its pros and cons, the data scientists frame the business problem
    into a statistical problem and decide which framework does it fall into? ML problems
    can be broadly categorized into supervised and unsupervised problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, the evaluation metric is important to decide on the best-performing algorithm.
    Care should be taken in terms of converting and translating the evaluation metric
    like Precision, Recall, etc (in case of classification) into the business metric.
    The data scientists work rigorously to get the best precision but fail to explain
    what implication it has on business outcomes. For example, understanding why precision
    is important in a particular use case would become clearer if we know the dollar
    value of a 1% drop in precision.

    to use like supervised/unsupervised, classification vs regression, etc, and eventually
    signed off the metric as an SLA to deliver the solution.

    part of the model-building journey begins from here. You have a green signal to
    talk about the data now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that the real-world solutions do not give you the luxury of a well-framed
    problem statement like the one Kaggle provides. As much as it is a hassle that
    every data scientist wants to avoid, this is the true testament of a seasoned
    data scientist. The one who can make its way through a not so clearly laid out
    situation and does not wait for instructions. Rather, works on making the best
    of the given data and documents the assumptions and limitations to back up the
    findings. One should not wait for the entire data to be made available - quite
    often you won’t have all the attributes that a human expert gets to act on in
    real-time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data exploration is the gateway to understanding your data better and forming
    a connection. The more time you invest in the data at this stage, the higher the
    returns would be towards the later stage in the model lifecycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The thorough investigation of the data includes but is not limited to finding
    correlations, detecting outliers, deciding the legitimate vs anomalous records,
    identifying missing values, understanding the right way to impute them, etc. Next,
    you might also need to perform data transformations like log transformation, data
    scaling and normalization, feature selection, and engineering new features.

    well on the incoming dataset or tree-based ensembles. Do you have enough data
    to train a neural network?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best performing model from the set of candidate models is chosen for tuning
    the hyperparameters. If you choose the neural network then how do you plan to
    tune the hyperparameters like the number of layers and neurons, learning rate,
    optimizer, loss function, etc.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being surrounded by technicals all around, it is easy to underrate the key skill
    to make the data science project a success i.e. communication. Yes, how you communicate
    the results that are tailor-made for different audiences shows the skill of molding
    the solution with varying degrees of technical jargon. The visualizations are
    worth a million bucks and super helpful in setting those business discussions
    to success.

- en: One important point is, to be honest with all your findings and then let everyone
    call the shots together. Don’t burden yourself with hitting the bullseye and present
    the golden solution. Call out where your model works vs where it fails. When can
    the business trust the model predictions and will what degree of confidence?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Essentially, your ability to explain model predictions and consideration into
    interpretable AI solutions will make you a great debugger of your model and will
    ensure the business that the model is in the right hands.

    be a lengthy process in itself. What would you do with the model waiting to get
    deployed? This is another charter in itself that broadly involves different aspects
    of MLOps like writing unit tests, budgeting for latency, validation dataset, model
    monitoring and maintenance, error analysis, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would you do with incoming data- whether to keep accumulating data or archive
    the older data and retrain the model on fresh data also needs a well-laid out
    formalism.
