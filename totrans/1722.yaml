    entails to do a data science project end to end i.e from the business problem
    defining phase to modelling and its final deployment. When I pondered on that
    request, I thought it made sense. The data science literature is replete with
    articles on specific algorithms or definitive methods with code on how to deal
    with a problem. However an end to end view of what it takes to do a data science
    project for a specific business use case is little hard to find. From this week
    onward, we would be starting a new series  called the Applied Data Science Series.
    In this series I would be giving an end to end perspective on tackling business
    use cases or societal problems within the framework of Data Science. In this first
    article of the applied data science series we will deal with a predictive maintenance
    business use case. The use case involved is to predict the end life of large industrial
    batteries, which falls under the genre of use cases called preventive maintenance
    use cases.

    science perspective, let us look at the big picture on the life cycle of a data

    a business problem from a Data Science perspective. Let us deal with each of the
    components end to end.

- en: The start of any data science project is with a business problem. The problem
    we have at hand is to try to predict the end life of large industrial batteries.
    When we are encountered with such a business problem, the first thing which should
    come to our mind is on the key variables which will come into play . For this
    specific example of batteries some of the key variables which determine the state
    of health of batteries are conductance, discharge , voltage, current and temperature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next questions which we need to ask is on the lead indicators or trends
    within these variables, which will help in solving the business problem. This
    is where we also have to take inputs from the domain team. For the case of batteries,
    it turns out that a key trend which can indicate propensity for failure  is drop
    in conductance values. The conductance of batteries will drop over time, however
    the rate at which the conductance values drop will be accelerated before points
    of failure. This is a vital clue which we will have to be cognizant about when
    we go for detailed exploratory analysis of the variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other key variable which can come into play is the discharge. When a battery
    is allowed to discharge the voltage will initially drop to a minimum level and
    then it will regain the voltage. This is called the “Coup de Fouet” effect. Every
    manufacturer of batteries will prescribes standards and control charts as to how
    much, voltage can drop and how the regaining process should be. Any deviation
    from these standards and control charts would mean anomalous behaviors. This is
    another set of indicator which will have to look out for when we explore data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to the above two indicators there are many other factors which one
    would have to be aware of which will indicate failure. During the business exploration
    phase we have to identify all such factors which are related to the business problem
    which we are to solve and formulate hypothesis about them. Once we formulate our
    hypothesis we have to look out for evidences / trends within the data about these
    hypothesis. With respect to the two variables which we have discussed above some
    hypothesis we can formulate are the following.

    drop would mean anomalous behavior

- en: When we go about in exploring data, hypothesis like the above will be point
    of reference in terms of trends which we will have to look out on the variables
    involved. The more hypothesis we formulate based on domain expertise the better
    it would be at the exploratory stage. Now that we have seen what it entails within
    the business discovery phase, let us encapsulate our discussions on key considerations
    within the business discovery phase

    about how data is captured and how the variables are represented within the data

- en: As seen, we have to play around with three very distinct data sets with different
    sets of variables, different frequency of time when the data points arrive and
    different volume of data for each of the variables involved. One of the key challenges,
    one would encounter is in connecting all these variables together into a coherent
    data set, which will help in the predictive task. It would be easier to get this
    done if we can formulate the predictive problem by connecting the data sets available
    to the business problem we are trying to solve. Let us first attempt to formulate
    the predictive problem.
