    is the vector dot product (scalar product) between the standardized features of
    ***X*** and ***Y***. The correlation coefficient takes values between -1 and 1\.
    A value close to 1 means strong positive correlation, a value close to -1 means
    strong negative correlation, and a value close to zero means low correlation or
    uncorrelation.

    Here n is the number of observations in the dataset, and the subscripts j and
    k take values 1, 2, 3, . . ., m, where m is the number of features in  the dataset.
    For example, if a dataset has 4 features with 100 observations, then n = 100,
    and m = 4, hence the covariance matrix will be a 4 x 4 matrix. The diagonal elements
    will all be 1, as they represent the correlation between a feature and itself,
    which by definition is equal to one.
