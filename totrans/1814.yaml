    learning embedded with sensors or close to the point of data collection -- the
    machine learning may be invoked via APIs or in processors close to the data collector
    or integrated into the sensor chip architecture itself. The patterns, trends,
    anomalies, and emergent phenomena (BOI: Behaviors of Interest) that are discovered
    close to the edge will enable better and faster predictive and prescriptive analytics
    applications in many domains: cybersecurity, digital marketing, customer experience,

    award" to a study that attempted to [replicate 100 top experiments](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/reproducibility-project-named-among-top-scientific-achievements-of-2015.html)
    published in psychology journals a few years previous. But researchers were only
    able to replicate 39\. Bad as this is, it is feared to be much better than the
    track record for Epidemiology, where those published medical "discoveries" appear
    to be right only 5-35% of the time. Most of the problems of finding [**spurious
    correlations**](/tag/overfitting), I believe, are due to bad data science. Replacing
    outdated significance formulas with resampling procedures such as [Target Shuffling](http://www.elderresearch.com/company/target-shuffling),
    would better calibrate how likely random results could arise as strong as the
    apparent discovery, given the vast search performed by the researcher and the
    mining software. New criteria would be needed for publication worthiness, but
    results would be much more reliable, saving massive resources, and even lives.
