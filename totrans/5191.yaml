    [articles](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/11/most-demand-skills-data-scientists.html)
    that he wrote back in 2018/2019\. I’m writing this simply because I wanted to
    get a more up-to-date analysis of what skills are in demand today, and I’m sharing
    this because I’m assuming that there are people out there that also want to see
    an updated version of the most in-demand skills for data scientists in 2021.

- en: Take what you want from this analysis — it’s obvious that the insights gathered
    from web scraping job postings do not offer a perfect correlation to what data
    science skills are actually most demanded. However, I think this gives a good
    indication of what general skills you should focus more on, and likewise, stray
    away from.

    Indeed, Monster, and SimplyHired. I didn’t webscrape LinkedIn because I ran into
    Captcha issues trying to scrape it.

    analysis!*):'

    it over the total number of data scientist job postings to get a percentage. For
    example, Python’s value of 0.77 means that 77% of the job postings had Python
    in it.

    get the percentage change from 2019 to 2021.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personally, I also stand by the fact that you should know either Python or R
    as well as SQL. I started with Python, and I’ll probably stick with Python for
    the rest of my life. It’s so far ahead in terms of open source contributions,
    and it’s straightforward to learn. SQL is arguably the most important skill to
    learn across anytype of data-related profession, whether you’re a data scientist,
    data engineer, data analyst, business analyst, the list goes on.

    for deep learning. PyTorch is a strong alternative, hence its ranking not too
    far behind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scikit-learn is arguably the most important library in Python for machine learning.
    After cleaning and manipulating your data with Pandas and/or NumPy, scikit-learn
    is used to build machine learning models as it has tons of tools used for predictive
    modelling and analysis.

    despite their representation above.
