    roles in the tech industry, such as software engineering and product management.
    Initially, DS interviews had a limited coding component, including only SQL or
    applied data manipulation sessions using Python or R. In recent years, however,
    DS interviews have shown an increased emphasis on computer science (CS) fundamentals
    (data structures, algorithms, and programming best practices).

    emphasis, there is a lower likelihood of encountering coding questions. Interviews
    for these roles do not often go beyond evaluating SQL proficiency, but general
    programming may still be tested from time to time. Candidates who do not possess
    a basic level of coding knowledge can be easily caught off guard during the interview
    and may fail to move forward in the process. Do not let that be you! Make sure
    you are prepared. You can start your preparation by learning what to expect with
    a coding interview.

- en: Just as with software engineering coding interviews, for DS coding interviews,
    it is reasonable to expect multi-part questions and sometimes multiple questions.
    In other words, speed is also important. Being able to solve more questions within
    a limited amount of time is a signal of overall proficiency.

- en: Before the interview, it is worth clarifying with recruiters what kinds of coding
    questions will be asked, as well as the approximate difficulty level. Lots of
    data science interviews do not require heavy programming, but that does not mean
    interviewers will not expect basic coding proficiency at your fingertips. Always
    ask your recruiter what to expect. If you make incorrect assumptions on the types
    of questions that can appear during interviews, you may end up preparing inadequately.

    Communication is key. A candidate who needed some help along the way but communicated
    clearly can be even better than a candidate who breezed through the question.
    Also, explain the overall approach to the interviewer before you begin the actual
    implementation.'

    it later. Think out loud. Say what you think might (or might not) work. You may
    soon realize something does work, or a modified version of it does. When stuck
    for more than several minutes on a particular part, it is okay to ask the interviewer
    for a moderate hint.'

    your interviewer might have about what you are doing.'
