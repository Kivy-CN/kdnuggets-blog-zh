    of my colleagues. Ph.D. and a very smart guy. He sent me the link to the webpage
    where you can play against ChatGPT as he thought. Unfortunately, it wasn''t pure
    ChatGPT, it was some other chess engine under the hood. He was deceived. You can

    side. 0–0–0 = Castling queen’s side, x = taking the piece. For pawns, we just
    write the square it lands, except when the pawn captures. In that case, we write
    the letter of the square where the pawn was before, and the letter and the number
    of the square on which it goes after taking the other piece. For example, exd4.

    no chess value, I will sum it up. ChatGPT 4 accused me of impossible moves, and

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. ChatGPT 4 is a very weak chess player, who plays very strangely — very good
    in early opening and terrible later. This is due to the increasing number of options
    as the chess game progresses. I would assess his overall ELO to be lower than
    1500\. Same for 3.5.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. No implicit learning of rules happened — ChatGPT 4 still hallucinates in
    chess, and keeps hallucinating after the warning about the hallucination. This
    is something that can’t happen to the human.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. More data would hardly solve the problem due to the edge cases like extra
    long endgames with repetition, or the possibility of playing unusual openings.
    LLMs simply aren’t built for playing chess, nor can evaluate the position. We
    already have AlphaZero and Stockfish for that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Tracking the drop in the number of hallucinations that LLMs perform in playing
    chess might be a good path for understanding the potential of LLMs for logical
    reasoning. But paradox remains — LLM “knows” the rules of chess, yet hallucinates
    heavily. The future of ML might be in LLM as the first-level agent that communicates
    to the user and then calls specialized agents with ML architectures adjusted for
    particular use cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5\. LLMs have the potential to be useful in scientific research and show an
    interesting level of creativity combined with other machine learning algorithms. A
    recent example is FunSearch algorithm developed by DeepMind that combines LLM
    and evaluator to make discoveries in math. Contrary to chess where the evaluation
    of the position is the hardest task, many problems in mathematical sciences are
    "easy to evaluate, despite being typically hard to solve".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m skeptical about building a well-performing chess-playing program based on
    transformers architecture, yet specialized LLM combined with external evaluation/chess
    program might be a good substitute for chess trainers soon. DeepMind created another
    cool model that is a good example of combining LLM and a specialized AI model
    — AlphaGeometry. It is very close to the Olympiad gold-medalist standard for geometry
    problems, advancing AI reasoning in mathematics.

    that’s often backed up by misleading and wrong conclusions. As the authors of
    the ‘’Mathematical discoveries from program search with large language models’’
    state:'

- en: 7\. The clip by Joe Rogan and 2 guests, titled ‘’I Wasn’t Afraid of AI Until
    I Learned This’’ was watched by 2,8 million of people on YouTube. One of the guests
    says that ChatGPT knows how to play chess which obviously isn’t the truth. I can
    just imagine how this kind of content influences people, especially uneducated
    or emotionally unstable individuals. Not in a good way, I’m sure about it.
  prefs: []

- en: To conclude, data science and software development is built on knowledge, precision
    and truth-seeking. As data scientists and developers, we should be people of truth
    and wisdom, calming down the madness produced by mass media about AI, not firing
    it up. Transformers, including ChatGPT, have great potential in language tasks,
    but they are still very far away from AGI. We should be optimistic but correct.
