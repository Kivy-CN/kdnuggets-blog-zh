- en: Exactly 2 years ago, I wrote an opinion piece called “Data Scientists Will be
    Extinct in 10 Years”. To my surprise, it would become one of my most-read articles
    on both Medium and  KDnuggets. However, the response was polarizing. It attracted
    the most criticism that I’ve received in my adult life. I foretold the demise
    of the sexiest (and one of the most in-demand) jobs of the 21st century and my
    peers took issue, but I accepted the feedback and life moved on. Fast forward
    to now; and what a difference two years makes. ChatGPT has taken the world by
    storm, and with it, the narrative that a specific role will be phased out has
    been eclipsed by another with far greater implications; the obsolescence of human
    capital in every conceivable industry.

- en: The revolution seems to have happened overnight. But those of us that have followed
    the progress of deep learning closely know very well that it didn’t. ChatGPT was
    the accumulation of decades of research that inexplicably culminated in an unassuming
    chatbot. At the core of the success of ChatGPT is the fact that it democratizes
    AI. Being code literate and having deep technical knowledge are longer barriers
    to entry, accessibility to cutting-edge deep learning has transcended the domain
    of academic research and big tech to be available at the fingertips of anyone
    with wifi access and an email address.

    revolution of the speed, scale, and nature that we experienced? Before LLMs and
    Text to Image Models, Generative AI (GAI) was largely synonymous with Ian Goodfellow’s
    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It was hailed as one of the great AI research
    contributions in recent years, manifesting in the ability to use a pair of neural
    networks to generate synthetic, photo-realistic images. Those of us that have
    worked with GANs before know that they’re notoriously difficult to train and even
    when implemented correctly, the use cases at the time were limited. Therefore,
    it’s even more amazing that generative deep learning has heralded the latest round
    of advancements.

    It can generate code, analysis of data sets, and results of queries directly from
    text prompts. The requirement for AI-ready professionals who can use ChatGPT has
    already started creeping into job descriptions and we know that despite the productivity
    gains that come with using GAIs, the AI is still prone to hallucinations, it can
    still get it wrong, reinforcing the need for deep domain expertise to address
    these instances. In summary, it hasn’t taken 10 years, it’s only taken two.

- en: However, data scientists becoming extinct doesn’t mean humans doing data science
    will become obsolete, quite the opposite in fact. When we look back in history,
    over the last 200 years we’ve witnessed several technological revolutions, these
    have included the introduction of steam power, mass production, and personal computing
    to name a few. Each one has enabled us to be more productive than the last as
    our roles and relationships with technology evolved, this concept is well rooted
    in economic theory (Solow Growth Model). In the current environment, businesses
    are creating and capturing more data than ever, thus data science skills will
    always be in demand but the data scientists of the future won’t be called data
    scientists, they will go by names like product managers, marketing specialists,
    or investment analysts. Data scientists are extinct, long live data science.
