- en: '[MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT) is a multi-agent framework for
    assigning roles to various agents which leads to the formation of collaborative
    entities which are able to work in tandem to execute complex instructions. MetaGPT
    bills itself as a "software company as multi-agent system," giving you an idea
    of the intended usage of these collaborative entities. MetaGPT can be used as
    a standalone app from the command line, and as a library within your own Python
    scripts, allowing for the flexibility and control one would desire in such a framework.'

    with code that emphasizes three pivotal techniques to augment problem-solving
    in data science: 1) dynamic planning with hierarchical graph structures for real-time
    data adaptability; 2) tool integration dynamically to enhance code proficiency
    during execution, enriching the requisite expertise; 3) logical inconsistency
    identification in feedback, and efficiency enhancement through experience recording.
    [...] Compared to open-source baselines, it demonstrated superior performance,
    exhibiting significant improvements in machine learning tasks, increasing from
    0.86 to 0.95\. Additionally, it showed a 26% increase in the MATH dataset and
    a remarkable 112% improvement in open-ended tasks.'

    face value, since they have published these results. Deep Wisdom has also made
    available a [plethora of examples](https://docs.deepwisdom.ai/main/en/DataInterpreter/)
    to show how their Data Interpreter agent can be used in conjunction with the existing
    MetaGPT framework.

    median, standard deviation, etc.) to understand the central tendency and dispersion
    of closing prices. Analyze the data for any noticeable trends, patterns, or anomalies
    over time, potentially using rolling averages or percentage changes. Create a
    plot to visualize all the data analysis. Reserve 20% of the dataset for validation.

    could ask for. You can find out more about installation and usage on the project's
    [GitHub repo](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT). I can attest from experience
    that MetaGPT is a worthwhile project to check out, and with the addition of the
    Data Interpreter agent, this is even more true than it was before.
