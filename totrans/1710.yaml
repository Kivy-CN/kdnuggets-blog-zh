    regarding what their typical day in the life of a data scientist consisted of.
    The response was genuinely overwhelming! Sure, no data scientist role is the same,
    and that's the reason for the inquiry. So many potential data scientists are interested
    in knowing what it is that those on the other side keep themselves busy with all
    day, and so I thought that having a few connections provide their insight might
    be a useful endeavor.

    the job announcements for a certain part country-language, clustering them, then
    getting the subset of training examples. Then I annotate these examples manually
    and build the model. I iterate build/test/add data/rebuild until the test error
    is low enough (~98%).

    accounts related to machine learning and data science. I switch into work projects
    around 8:30 am and finish around 4:30 pm to 5:00 pm with a break for lunch. About
    40% of my time is spent on research and development, with a strong focus in mathematics
    (topology, in particular)--involving anything from developing and testing new
    algorithms to writing mathematical proofs to simplify data problems. Sometimes,
    the results are confidential and stay within the company (shared through monthly
    Lunch & Learn presentations within the company); other times, I'm allowed to publish
    or present at external conferences.

    my company and seeking new projects, which often identify problems related operating
    procedures, problems related to data capture, or connections between previous
    projects that provide a more comprehensive view of operations. This is probably
    one of the most crucial aspects of the job. People I meet often bring up problems
    they are seeing or mention how neat it would be to have a predictive model for
    sales/student outcomes/operations, and I've found it opens the door to conversations
    and best practice suggestions down the road. As a data scientist, it's important
    to communicate with a wide range of stakeholders, and it's helped me simplify
    my explanations of machine learning algorithms to a layman's level.

    up results. This includes forecast models, predictive models of key metrics, and
    data mining for subgroups and trends within a given dataset. Each project is unique,
    and I try to let the project and its initial findings guide me to next steps.
    I mainly use R and Tableau for projects, though Python, Matlab, and SAS are occasionally
    helpful with specific packages or R&D requests. I can usually recycle the code,
    but each problem has its own assumptions and data limitations with respect to
    the mathematics. Projects can usually be simplified using tools from topology,
    real analysis, and graph theory, which speeds up the project and allows for the
    use of extant packages, rather than a need to code from scratch. As the only data
    scientist at a large company, this allows me to cover more projects and uncover
    more insight for our internal customers.

    data scientist in a team implementing Big Data Analytics in a southeast Asian
    Bank. We have data engineers, admin/ infrastructure people, data scientists and
    of course customer engagement managers in the team catering to each specific need
    of the project. My current organization is an AI startup named [**Kogentix**](http://kogentix.com/),
    not only having Big Data Services but also a Big Data Product named **AMP** which
    acts like a GUI on PySpark and tries to automate Big Data. AMP is quite cool and
    I will come to it soon. This leads to the focus of my startup to get as many clients
    as possible as well as test and implement out our Big Data Product. This means
    demonstrating success in our client engagements- one of our client was shortlisted
    for an award last month. Am I sounding too marketing oriented- you bet I am. The
    work a data scientist does is usually of a strategic consequence to the client.

    my role was quite opposite. Our client was India’s Ministry of Finance (the arm
    that deals with taxes). Junior data scientists pulled data using SQL from an RDBMS
    (due to legacy issues), and I validated the results.The reports were then sent
    to the various clients. On an ad-hoc basis we also used SAS Enterprise Miner as
    a concept test to show time series forecasts of imports and exports for India.
    Timelines are quite slow and bureacratic when working for a federal government
    vis a vis working for the private sector. I remembered one presentation when the
    bureaucrat in charge was astonished we were executing machine learning and why
    the government did not use it earlier. But SAS/VA (for Dashboards),SAS Fraud Analytics
    (which I trained on and which was in process of implementation) and Base SAS (the
    analytics workhorse) are amazing software and I doubt how anything resembling
    SAS Domain Specific Bundles can be made soon.

    day, this involves providing updates on key projects to both immediate team members,
    managers and senior leaders, as appropriate. One thing I find fascinating about
    this aspect of the job is the need for brevity. A company like LinkedIn has tons
    of internal communication happening so everything that goes out must be distilled
    into clear and concise results/talking points.

    of analytics, data science and the organization itself. I learn from my mistakes
    and watch how others do things more efficiently or in different ways from me.
    When I wake up each day, I seek failure as part of the job because it makes me
    better the next day. Analytics and the rapid pace of expansion of data science
    sure provides plenty of these opportunities!
