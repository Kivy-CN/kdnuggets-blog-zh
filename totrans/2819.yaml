    their biggest machine learning pain points and what work their teams plan to focus
    on in 2020\. One of the most frequently mentioned pain points was deploying machine
    learning models. More specifically, **“How do you deploy machine learning models
    in an automated, reproducible, and auditable manner?”**

- en: The topic of ML deployment is rarely discussed when machine learning is taught.
    Boot camps, data science graduate programs, and online courses tend to focus on
    training algorithms and neural network architectures because these are "core"
    machine learning ideas. I don’t disagree with that, but I’d argue that if a data
    scientist can’t deploy a model, he won’t be able to add much, if any, value to
    a business.

    blog posts about writing Flask APIs. Many of these are well done, but not all
    ML models need to be deployed behind a Flask API. In fact, sometimes, this is
    counterproductive. These posts rarely discuss what factors to consider when deploying
    a model, the variety of tools that can be used, and other important ideas. These
    topics are extensive and a single blog post wouldn’t do them justice.

    models. This series will discuss what it means to deploy an ML model, what factors
    to consider when deploying models, what software development tactics to use, and
    the tools and frameworks to utilize. If you’d like to be alerted when each of

- en: Before you think about what tools to use to deploy your model, you need to have
    a firm grasp on what deployment means. To attain that understanding, it’s helpful
    to put yourself in the shoes of a software engineer. How does a software engineer
    think about "deploying" code? How does the concept of deploying code transfer
    to the domain of machine learning? Thinking about deployment as a software engineer
    rather than as a data scientist will dramatically simplify what it means to deploy
    a model.

    lifecycle of an ML project. Hypothetically, a product manager (PM) will discover
    some user need and determine that machine learning can be used to solve this problem.
    This will involve creating a new product or augmenting an existing product with
    machine learning capabilities, typically in the form of a supervised learning
    model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The PM will meet with an ML team lead to plan the project by defining project
    goals, choosing a metric, and setting up the codebase. If appropriate training
    and validation data exist, the project will be handed off to data scientists or
    ML engineers to handle the iterative process of feature engineering and model
    selection.

    that meets or exceeds the goals set during the planning stage. Throughout these
    initial stages, the users’ needs that motivated this project are still unmet.
    These needs won’t be satisfied even when a model exists that achieves the minimum
    required levels of predictive performance.'

    that model’s insights routinely become available to the users for which it was
    built. The process of taking a trained ML model and making its predictions available
    to users or other systems is known as **deployment**. Deployment is entirely distinct
    from routine machine learning tasks like feature engineering, model selection,
    or model evaluation.

    ML engineers who lack backgrounds in software engineering or DevOps. But luckily
    these skills aren’t very difficult. With practice, any data scientist can learn
    how to deploy their models to production.

    interact with the model’s predictions. This is best understood through a few examples.
    We’ll work our way up in complexity, beginning with a very simple use case.

    for a group of leads and doing so once a day) are still valid, but aspect 3 is
    not. Deployment involves having the scores flow from the database into the CRM
    tool. This will involve setting up additional ETLs.

    of machine learning, might be deployed. Suppose that we work for an e-commerce
    company that wishes to show users recommendations of products to purchase. We’ll
    consider two variations of deployment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Scenario 1: The company wishes to display product recommendations to users
    after they login to either the web or mobile application. Predictions need to
    be *available* upon request, which can be at any time of day. This places a latency
    constraint on our deployment, which affects whether we can generate predictions
    on-the-fly as a user logs in, or whether we have to generate and cache predictions
    beforehand. The deployment must make the model’s predictions available to both
    the mobile and web applications. Thus separating our deployment from either of
    these applications is desirable.'

- en: 'Scenario 2: The company wishes to add 5 recommendations to its marketing emails
    to existing customers. These emails are sent to users twice a week; one email
    goes out Monday afternoon and another goes out Friday morning. In this case, recommendations
    can be computed for all users at the same time and cached. Latency requirements
    are much less strict compared to the previous scenario. Storing these recommendations
    in a database is sufficient. The process for generating the emails can look up
    the user’s recommendations in this database and add the top 5 to the personalized
    emails.'

- en: Automated deployment of machine learning models is one of the biggest pain points
    facing data scientists and ML engineers in 2020\. Since models can only add value
    to an organization when insights are regularly available to end-users, it's imperative
    that ML practitioners understand how to deploy their models as simply and efficiently
    as possible. The first step in determining how to deploy a model is understanding
    how end users should interact with that model’s predictions.
