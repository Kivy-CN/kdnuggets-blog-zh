    modeling, and exploring data. While that may be true, there is no reason that
    others can't be — or are not being — used to do this work.

- en: The Bash shell is a Unix and Unix-like operating system shell, along with the
    commands and programming language that go along with it. Bash scripts are programs
    written using this Bash shell scripting language. These scripts are executed sequentially
    by the Bash interpreter, and can include all of the constructs typically found
    in other programming languages, including conditional statements, loops, and variables.
