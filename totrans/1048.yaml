  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, within the technology industry, “meta” refers to an underlying
    definition or description. More directly, metadata provides context about the
    data, more than what you see in the rows and columns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That definition is quite broad, but that’s mostly because it can be used for
    almost any purpose – it can tell you what each column header means in detail,
    who uploaded the data and when, the column and row counts for the whole dataset,
    the original data source, or even warehousing and residency requirements.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are 3 main types of metadata that work together: administrative, descriptive,
    and structural. Each serves a different purpose in explaining the corresponding
    data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Structural metadata – provides insight into how data elements are organized.
    This facilitates quick and easy navigation, like a table of contents or page numbers.
    Structural metadata allows similar data to be grouped together, documenting relationships
    among unique datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Administrative metadata – offers technical information about the data. It covers
    aspects such as the origin of the data, type of data and access or usage licences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Descriptive metadata – adds information about the owner, when the data was created/published,
    and what the data includes. The essential purpose is to ease identification and
    offer a snapshot of the data it describes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A combination of these types of metadata allows organizations to navigate through
    vast amounts of data efficiently, making it easy to find what you need when you
    need it.

- en: '[53% of analytics consumers](https://dresneradvisory.com/press-releases/dresner-advisory-services-publishes-2021-data-catalog-market-study)
    have difficulty locating and accessing data content. With increasing amounts of
    data, it is important for organizations to understand the data they have, where
    it is, and how to use it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Metadata's utility does not begin and end with describing data. Metadata can
    enable easier data discovery, and can help increase understanding of a dataset.
    Take a library book, for example. If the text is the primary data, the book jacket
    may have a brief summary of the book, and comments from others about the book.
    Importantly, the library may also append data that gives the book a category,
    genre, and unique identifier for easier organization and retrieval.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Metadata can also assist in compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring
    that your organization tracks usage, sharing, and licence permissions at the dataset
    level. By appending metadata that makes it clear how the data can be used, for
    what purpose, and who it can or can’t be shared with, you’re able to build security
    and compliance into the data itself.
