- en: A dictionary in Python is a collection that is both unordered and mutable, designed
    to store data values like a map. Unlike other Data Types that hold only single
    values as elements, Dictionary holds pairs of keys and values separated by colons,
    a “:” element.

- en: This Key-value pairs structure provides a way to store data so that it can be
    efficiently retrieved by key rather than position.

    whole execution. This is why this guide attempts to shed some light and explain
    some effective ways to access dictionaries avoiding the break of our execution.

    It requires the key you're searching for and allows an optional second parameter
    for a default value if the key is not found.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The choice between get() and setdefault() depends on your specific needs. Use
    get() when you simply need to retrieve data without altering the original dictionary.
    Opt for setdefault() when your task requires adding new entries to the dictionary.

    and setdefault() can significantly enhance the robustness and readability of your
