- en: If you are just getting started with R, RStudio, and Machine Learning, you may
    already know that a great and easy way to get motivated is by looking at concrete
    examples and workflows from experienced people in the field. For this post, we
    have gathered a set of educational videos with hands-on examples on how to implement
    some of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms. We begin by giving you a
    general introduction and motivation to Machine Learning and the R language. You
    will be able to go along with examples and presentations, and you will get familiarized
    with the syntax and the procedures of implementing Machine Learning projects in
    R. Please enjoy watching this series of videos and try them out yourself, take
    advantage of this great summary and compilation to do your own experiments and
    models.
