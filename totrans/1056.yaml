- en: Generally, the assessment test is divided into five parts; **statistics**, **business
    analytics**, **coding**, **SQL**, and hands-on **data analytics**. You will be
    given a dataset and 20 minutes to answer three to four business-related questions.
    Even if you are an expert in data analysis, you cannot do data ingestion, data
    analytics, and reporting in a limited time. For that, you need super tools that
    can automate the data analysis part so that you can focus on answering the questions
    from a business case study.

    data analytics part. We will be learning about Deepnote, Autoviz, Pandas profiling,
    and Sweetviz. These tools require a few lines of code to display critical information

    and assessment tests. I can easily produce a simple data report within 20 minutes.
    Deepnote has also helped me in passing multiple data science and machine learning
    assessment tests. If you are interested in my Deepnote projects check out my [profile](https://deepnote.com/@abid).

- en: The tools we have disused are great for generating exploratory data analysis
    reports. In the end, it comes down to your understanding of the subject matter
    and your experience in the data science sector. The assessment questions are usually
    around a business case study, for example; historical sales data of a digital
    camera company. These tools can assist you in understanding the dataset but without
    subject matter expertise, it will be hard for you to answer the questions.
