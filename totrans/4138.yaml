    to automated something, you wouldn't be writing code. That script you wrote to
    process CSV files? Automation. That program you wrote to parse text input? Automation.

    something manually X times versus taking the time to automate it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/kwlc4e/ah_yes_the_programmer_move/)
    is a bit of an art form, but generally-speaking if you are going to do the same
    thing on your computer over and over, you may as well automate it. And what better
    choice than to automate with Python, one of the most popular, well-supported,
    and easy to use programming languages we have at our disposable today.

- en: '[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news) has recently launched a free
    course on automating with Python, conveniently titled [Automate with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXMJ6FS7llk).
    Taught by [Frank Andrade](https://frank-andrade.medium.com/), the course has a
    unique approach to teaching Python and its usefulness in taking the mundane out
    of repetitive tasks. The course is project-based, in that it sets out 4 major
    projects and each section builds upon the Python skills needed to be able to complete
    said project. There are no one-off lines of code here; everything fits together,
    progresses nicely, and makes sense.'

    course, you should also gain an understanding of how to think in terms of automation,
    honing your skills and changing your perspective to be on the lookout for opportunities
    to do the same in future situations. You will also learn the usage of some automation-friendly
    Python libraries such as Path, Selenium, and XPath. You'll also pickup some other
    valuable skills along the way such as some basic HTML, converting Python files
    to EXEs, scheduling scripts, writing Excel formulas with Python, and more.
