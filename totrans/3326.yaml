    posed in our [17 More Must-Know Data Science Interview Questions and Answers](/2017/02/17-data-science-interview-questions-answers.html)
    series earlier this year. The answer was thorough enough that it was deemed to
    deserve its own dedicated post.'

    or not a customer buys a particular product or not (Yes/No), based on independent
    variables such as gender, age, location etc.

    example, if you only get a higher TPR in predicting patients who don’t have cancer,
    it will not help at all in diagnosing cancer.

    have cancer, then this would be a case of class imbalance, as the percentage of
    cancer patients is very small compared to rest of the population. There are main
    2 approaches to handle this issue:'

- en: '**Use of a cost function**: In this approach, a cost associated with misclassifying
    data is evaluated with the help of a cost matrix (similar to the confusion matrix,
    but more concerned with False Positives and False Negatives). The main aim is
    to reduce the cost of misclassifying. The cost of a False Negative is always more
    than the cost of a False Positive. e.g. wrongly predicting a cancer patient to
    be cancer-free is more dangerous than wrongly predicting a cancer-free patient
    to have cancer.'

    under-sampling, or hybrid sampling. In over-sampling, minority class observations
    are replicated to balance the data. Replication of observations leading to overfitting,
    causing good accuracy in training but less accuracy in unseen data. In under-sampling,
    the majority class observations are removed causing loss of information. It is
    helpful in reducing processing time and storage, but only useful if you have a
    large data set.'
