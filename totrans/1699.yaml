- en: Can nonprofit organizations benefit from data science? A survey carried out
    by [Every Action](https://blog.everyaction.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-nonprofits-big-data)
    finds that 90% of nonprofits indicate that they're collecting data, but "almost
    half say they aren’t fully aware of the ways data can (and does) impact their
    work". This is not surprising, given the fact that most nonprofit bodies do not
    have a dedicated data analysis team. However, the wave of big data is now reaching
    NGOs and government bodies as well, who can use data science to make a bigger
    impact. Data analysis can help these organizations make sure that they're putting
    their time, effort, money and energy into the right channels. Nonprofit organizations
    need funds to fulfill their missions but also need to prove the results of their
    work in order to attract donors. Data science has immense potential in optimizing
    this cycle, and also helps organizations make well-informed, sound decisions.
    While not every organization can afford to hire full-time data analysts, some
    fill the resource gap by seeking help on platforms like [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
    and [Stack Exchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/), or by hiring freelance
    data scientists and consultants through [Kolabtree](https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/subject/data-analysis?utm_source=KDNuggets)
    and [Experfy](https://www.experfy.com/). Here are some examples of how nonprofits
    and charity organizations can make use of data science.

    that can help them optimize fundraising. [Amnesty International](https://data-informed.com/amnesty-international-optimizes-fundraising-with-analytics/)
    is using segmentation and predictive modelling to help them identify and target
    the right groups, so that they can develop a more refined marketing strategy.
    Data insights help NGOs identify and segregate donors based on various factors,
    using which they can drive their marketing and fundraising efforts more effectively.
    Data analysis also helps charity organizations discover relationships, that can
    help them develop specific incentives. After studying their data and finding that
    they could provide something for their donors, rather than the other way around,
    Macmillan's Cancer Support introduced the "World's Biggest Coffee" initiative,
    which saw a leap in the income generated from [£15m to £20m](https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/mar/04/how-to-use-data-analysis-to-enhance-fundraising).

    activities, and help them tailor their processes towards better results. Data
    analysis and visualization can also play a huge role in real-time tracking during
    crises and optimizing relief efforts. Qlik, a software company based in the USA,
    provides data science tools that organizations can use to discover insights, patterns

    in which they train Fellows to work on data science projects that specifically
    focus on social impact. The Fellows work with government bodies and nonprofits
    to tackle issues related to education, healthcare, public safety and the environment.
    One of their projects, in partnership with the Chicago Department of Public Health,
    uses predictive analytics to help prevent lead poisoning in children. Lead-based
    paint was used before the ban in 1978, and children who live in older homes are
    still likely to be exposed to it. The models identify houses that are likely to
    have lead-based paint, taking into account various factors, which then allows
    for mitigating the dangers of exposure.

    to help them find a cost-effective way to deliver their mid-day meal scheme to
    Government schools across the country. Optimizing the routes through which they
    delivered this scheme helped them make sure that they were using their monetary
    resources effectively. Allocating funds based on insights from analytics helps
    NGOs make optimal use of their resources, which is primary to its smooth functioning.

    nonprofits, big and small, is quite clear. But accessing experts is a common problem
    that these organizations face. Processes are often bureaucratic and funds may
    be inadequate to employ a full-fledged team. And so many organizations don't see
    the power of data science manifest. Organizations like Datakind help connect data
    scientists to social organizations, however, scientists offer their services on
    a voluntary basis. One solution is for organizations is to [consult freelance
    data science experts](https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/subject/data-analysis?utm_source=KDNuggets)
    for short-term projects. This helps them access the expertise of data analysts
    while keeping the process cost-effective. This is definitely one way the third
    sector can reap the benefits of data science and stay empowered, so that they
    can empower others.
