- en: There are a number of lists that examine who is influential on LinkedIn, or
    who is active in Big Data / Data Science space, but we have not seen a list which
    combines both criteria. KDnuggets earlier post [**Meet the 11 Big Data & Data
    Science Leaders on LinkedIn**](/2016/05/10-big-data-data-science-leaders-linkedin.html)
    looked at people with large number of followers on LinkedIn, but some of them,
    like Hilary Mason, have not published since 2013, while others have written mainly
    on topics unrelated to Big Data and Data Science. This post presents 16 leaders
    in Big Data and Data Science who have published a post in the last 3 months and
    who have at least 3 relevant posts this year. The number of followers are as of
    Sep 23, 2016.
