    points are spread out from the mean.

    the mean and the second dataset has values more spread out.

    for the second set is 14.67.
  prefs: []

- en: However, it's not easy to wrap your head around numbers like 3.13 or 14.67\.
    Right now, we only know that the second data set is more “spread out” than the
    first one.

    values rallying around a mean and having almost equal results below and above
    it e.g.

    about 68% of values drawn from a normal distribution are within one standard deviation
    σ away from the mean; about 95% of the values lie within two standard deviations;
    and about 99.7% are within three standard deviations.

    IoT devices generating heating equipment data. Each data point contained the electricity
    usage at a point of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, sometimes the devices weren’t 100% accurate and would give very high
    or very low values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We needed to remove these outlier values because they were making the scales
    on our graph unrealistic. The challenge was that the number of these outlier values
    was never fixed. Sometimes we would get all valid values and sometimes these erroneous
    readings would cover as much as 10% of the data points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our approach was to remove the outlier points by eliminating any points that
    were above (Mean + 2*SD) and any points below (Mean - 2*SD) before plotting the
    frequencies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don’t have to use 2 though, you can tweak it a little to get a better outlier
    detection formula for your data.

- en: Here’s an example using [Python programming](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming).
    The dataset is a classic normal distribution but as you can see, there are some
    values like 10, 20 which will disturb our analysis and ruin the scales on our
    graphs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you case see, we removed the outlier values and if we plot this dataset,
    our plot will look much better.

    for all statistical analysis though, outliers have an import function in statistics
    and they are there for a reason!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in our case, the outliers were clearly because of error in the data and
    the data was in a normal distribution so standard deviation made sense.
