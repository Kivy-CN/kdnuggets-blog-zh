- en: Gartner analysts have coined the term, “[citizen data scientist](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-use-citizen-data-scientists-to-maximize-your-da-strategy)”
    to mean “a person who creates and generates models that leverage predictive or
    prescriptive analytics, but whose primary job function is outside of the field
    of statistics and analytics.” And in some circles, this role has been widely promoted
    as being the solution to help organizations accelerate their ML/AI journey.

    a replacement for true data scientists.

    leverage AI and ML to accelerate their business and achieve greater outcomes.
    On average, only [54% of AI models](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-08-22-gartner-survey-reveals-80-percent-of-executives-think-automation-can-be-applied-to-any-business-decision)
    move from the pilot to production phase, according to a new survey by Gartner.
    There are several reasons behind this; for some companies, not having a skilled
    data science team is just one of them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Skilled professionals cost money – you have to hire the right people with the
    right skills. So, the idea of a citizen data scientist is appealing – this notion
    that you could have someone go in to quickly build a model using the tool sets
    they’re given without having a strong understanding about the data, the background
    of that data, or how to cleanse the data and pick the right features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This scenario is appealing but highly unlikely. Someone without that background,
    without that context-specific understanding, can’t just go and build a model.
    There’s not going to be a good outcome because fundamentally, they don’t know
    what they have; they’re just throwing things into the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What’s more is that we’ve seen a number of examples where even well-trained
    data scientists have (inadvertently) contributed to bias and drift issues with
    ML models. Think of the case of [Zillow’s failed iBuying algorithms](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/ibuying-algorithms-failed-zillow-says-business-worlds-love-affair-ai/)
    or [Facebook’s terrible photo mislabeling](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/facebook-ai-race-primates.html)
    incident. In other words, if even the experts can get it wrong, how can we reasonably
    expect the novices to get it right?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you go this route, you’re going to wind up with a classic “garbage in, garbage
    out” problem. Let’s say your organization is a bank, and you’re a business analyst
    with access to a data warehouse. You have access to people’s income level, demographics,
    locations, address and so on. The idea that some technology vendors are putting
    forth is that you can just take this data and throw it into their tool – and then
    it will pick the right algorithm for you and hand you the right prediction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what often happens in this process is that maybe no one is going in to ensure
    that data is correct. You have to make sure you’re doing data cleansing or feature
    engineering. You have to understand what you have. For instance, in a loan application,
    you have different elements – a street address, a phone number and so on. When
    you’re doing feature engineering, each piece of information can be a feature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, what a data scientist needs to do is determine which element carries
    the weight in order to predict the outcomes. And a citizen data scientist is unlikely
    to be able to do this without a lot of training and heavy lifting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If that person doesn’t understand the data and puts it into a tool without proper
    data cleansing, your input is garbage, and the system will spit out garbage based
    on a lack of understanding of the data. The tool alone can’t make the data better.

    curate the data and determine what’s good and bad. You need people who know how
    to do feature engineering. Otherwise, you’re going to end up with models or algorithms
    that fail you.

- en: A citizen data scientist is a great aspiration, but it’s not a cure-all, and
    it’s not a replacement for trained data scientists. To put it another way, how
    would you feel if you were on a plane and were informed that a “citizen pilot”
    (or even a student pilot or an avid user of flight simulators) would be flying
    the plane?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s just not that simple. And again, this doesn’t mean that the citizen data
    scientist isn’t a viable concept. It’s just important to understand that these
    roles need to be supplements to, not replacements for, data scientists.
  prefs: []

    for certain skilled roles, especially as many industries struggle with skills
    gaps.However, at this current juncture in time, the technology isn’t at a level
    where AI/ML projects can just be handed off to citizen data scientists.

    has come to understand how realistic this approach is and where it works. For
    serious software development, the no-code/low-code approach doesn’t work when
    you need to develop mission critical software. It is even more far-fetched, then,
    to have only citizen data scientists running your AI/ML.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A deep understanding of your data is critical to AI/ML success. This is what
    professional data scientists bring, along with the necessary contextual insight
    that determines which data is good and useful and which isn’t. While it’s certainly
    a positive to bring in new voices and ideas into the field, this doesn’t eliminate
    the need for skilled, professional data scientists. You can’t cut costs by not
    having professional data scientists in place.
