    on customer experience, revenue, operations, supply chain, risk management and
    many other business functions. Data science enables a data-centric decision-making
    process for organizations, accelerating digital transformation and AI initiatives.
    [According to Gartner, Inc](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-02-13-gartner-says-nearly-half-of-cios-are-planning-to-deploy-artificial-intelligence).
    only four percent of CIOs have implemented AI, and only 46 percent have plans
    to do so. While investments continue to grow, many enterprises find it increasingly
    challenging to implement and accelerate data science practices. This article provides
    an overview of recent trends in machine learning and data science automation tools
    and addresses how those tools will change data science.

    A typical enterprise data science project is highly complex and involves many
    steps, including data collection, last-mile ETL* (data wrangling), feature engineering,
    machine learning, visualization and production (see illustration below). A traditional
    data science project takes several months to complete even for an experienced
    team. It is a highly involved and collaborative process that requires a wide range
    of specialized skill sets, such as domain experts, data engineers, data scientists,
    business intelligence engineers, and software architects. In addition, the outcome
    of most enterprise data science projects are hard to interpret, making it difficult
    for business users to implement the results.

- en: Playing with machine learning (ML) models is considered to be the fun part,
    but the real pain point of any data science project is often last-mile ETL and
    feature engineering. As illustrated below, machine learning requires a single
    flat table called a feature table. Given a feature table, data scientists can
    play with ML algorithms. But actual enterprise data is never a single flat table.
    Instead, it’s a collection of many data tables with complex relationships.

    of tables into a feature table. These are the most challenging and time-consuming
    steps in a data science project and require highly skilled data scientists and
    domain experts – expensive and scarce resources.

    in 2013) and has become very trendy.  [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/)
    and [H2O.ai](http://h2o.ai) are leading startups in machine learning automation.

- en: The fundamental idea of machine learning automation is to train scoring models
    using different algorithms (including preprocessing like missing value imputation)
    with different hyper-parameters, and validate their accuracy to select the best
    model. Recently, companies like [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) have also
    started to support [machine learning automation tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/machine-learning/service/tutorial-auto-train-models)
    (more details can be found [here](https://www.automl.org/) or [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/software/automated-data-science.html)).
    These great tools significantly simplify building machine learning models. On
    the other hand, last-mile ETL and feature engineering is still a manual process
    and requires the substantial involvement of domain experts and data scientists.

    focus on non-linear transformations of a given feature table, which is just a
    small component of the feature engineering process and relies on manual creation
    of the feature table. [dotData](https://dotdata.com/) released a platform that
    not only automates feature engineering from source data but also automates machine
    learning as well. dotData calls it “data science automation”. Its AI-powered feature
    engineering automatically designs and generates important and interpretable features
    without domain knowledge. This platform covers a wide range of tasks as it pertains
    to the data science process and make it easier and faster to build and implement
    data science projects.

    which involves significant upfront efforts in data cleansing, ETL, and feature
    engineering because each individual step requires heavily manual and time-consuming

    have not yet implemented AI and data science. Many enterprise-grade automation
    tools such as [dotData](https://dotdata.com/) automatically produce APIs or executable
    packages that can be immediately operationalized in production. This significantly
    shortens the time and barrier to implement data science in enterprises (the last
    step of the first illustration above).'

    is “master data ETL” which prepare data for general purposes in the organization.
    There are many great tools to support this process such as [informatica](https://www.informatica.com/).
    On the other hand, even if the master data are well prepared, we still need customized
    ETL work for each analytics use case, which is referred to as “last-mile ETL”.'
