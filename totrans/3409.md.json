In this post, we only scratched the surface of what you can do with MLDB. We have a [white-­paper](http://blog.mldb.ai/files/whitepaper_big2016.pdf) that goes over all of our design decisions in details.    If we’ve peaked your interest, here are a few links that may interest you:    *   try MLDB for free in 5 minutes by [launching a hosted instance](https://mldb.ai/#signup) *   run a trial version of MLDB on your own hardware using [Docker or Virtualbox](https://docs.mldb.ai/doc/#builtin/Running.md.html) *   Check out our [demos and tutorials](https://docs.mldb.ai/doc/#builtin/Demos.md.html), especially [DeepTeach](https://github.com/mldbai/deepteach) which uses the same techniques as shown in this post, and [MLPaint](http://blog.mldb.ai/blog/posts/2016/09/mlpaint/), a white­box real­time handwritten digit recogniser *   [MLDB Github repository](https://github.com/mldbai/mldb)    Don’t hesitate to get in touch! You can find us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mldbai/mldb), or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mldbai).    All the code from this article is available in the MLDB repository as a [Jupyter notebook](https://docs.mldb.ai/ipy/notebooks/_other/_latest/KDNuggets%20Transfer%20Learning%20Blog%20Post.html), and is also shipped with MLDB. Boot up an instance, go the the demos folder and you can run a live version.    Happy MLDBing!    **Bio: [François Maillet](http://blog.francoismaillet.com/)** is a computer scientist specialising in machine learning and data science. He leads the machine learning team at MLDB.ai, a Montréal startup building the [Machine Learning Database](http://mldb.ai/)​ (MLDB). François has been applying machine learning for almost 10 years to solve varied problems, like real­-time bidding algorithms and behavioral modelling for the adtech industry, automatic bully detection on web forums, audio similarity and fingerprinting, steerable music recommendation and playlist generation.    **Related:**    *   [Recycling Deep Learning Models with Transfer Learning](/2015/08/recycling-deep-learning-representations-transfer-ml.html) *   [Spark for Scale: Machine Learning for Big Data](/2016/09/spark-scale-machine-learning-big-data.html) *   [The Deception of Supervised Learning](/2016/09/deception-of-supervised-learning.html)     * * *      ## Our Top 3 Course Recommendations      ![](../Images/0244c01ba9267c002ef39d4907e0b8fb.png) 1\\.
