    progress in AI research, the good news is that the need for data scientists is
    not going anywhere anytime soon. There are literally [hundreds of thousands of
    new Data Science positions being opened every year](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-job-trends/).
    In fact, employers typically struggle with the shortage of labor. So, with this
    many opportunities on the market, it can't be that hard for newcomers to land
    the job of their dreams, right? Unfortunately, things are never that simple, and
    the reality is that even with so many vacant positions, junior applicants still
    face huge challenges to penetrate the field.

- en: Though the term was coined in 2001, Data Science isn’t a new field. The way
    it is practiced has changed dramatically over time. That said, it is only in the
    late 2000s and early 2010s when collecting and processing became easier with the
    popularization of the GPU machines and the sudden hype around Big Data that it
    became mainstream for companies to build entire teams dedicated to analyzing and
    leveraging their data. The problem? The people they were hiring were often brilliant
    computer scientists and statisticians, but they were rarely capable of converting
    their skills into tangible business value, often because the companies who had
    hired them had no idea what data to collect, and how to manage it. Those same
    companies quickly realized that they were losing money (how they fixed that issue
    is a separate story) and eventually learned the hard way that technical expertise
    isn’t sufficient to become a great data scientist.

    that a resume with loaded academic credentials might not get you very far. What
    hiring managers need to see is your ability to use those skills to help their
    business grow. Your long list of academic publications isn’t going to give them
    the confidence that you are the right person for the job. In fact, recruiters
    are particularly suspicious of resumes full of school projects, just because they
    see plenty of such resumes among candidates who doesn’t work out.

    most cross-domain competencies and the most acute communication skills. It’s just
    not a job you can do all alone. It’s a job which will require you to expand your
    skills to bridge the gap between the Engineering, Product and Business teams,
    whom you will depend on for your success. In short, you need to become a bit of
    Jack-of-all-Trades while remaining the data expert. So the resumes that catch
    their eye are those that display something different. Something that wouldn’t
    be expected from a fresh grad. And something that can prove the candidate is ready
    to tackle real-life problems.

    in Kaggle competitions, as they were an easy way for them to prove their ability
    to work on real-size, industry datasets. For a while, ranking reasonably well
    for a Kaggle competition was a differentiator, and it would land people interviews
    fairly easily. But nowadays, participating in a Kaggle competition has become
    the new norm. Candidates hardly stand out because of it; it is actually something
    that’s almost expected nowadays.

    at that. Yet, there is one thing that Kaggle was never able to achieve: paliate
    to the most severe shortcoming of academic Data Science education: the lack of
    awareness on the topic of Data Preparation. Because Kaggle provides fully ready
    datasets to train on, the competitors have only one thing to do: build, tune and
    train models, without ever worrying about data quality. Therefore, even with multiple
    high-quality submissions to Kaggle to boast about on their resume, candidates
    are still falling short when it comes to bringing hiring managers the confidence
    that they can work with real-life data other than feeding it into a model.'

    their model building skills, though it is easy to differentiate oneself by demonstrating
    awesome Data Preparation skills. And how one can do just that is precisely the
    topic of the next section.

    it is the concept of optimizing the performance of a Machine Learning model by
    putting in the work on the training data, as opposed to the model.'

    treat their training data as a static object that they feed into a model which
    they will modify, tune and perfect until they are satisfied with the results.
    Once they are okay with the validation performance, they consider the model “ready”
    and move on to testing before having their model deployed. This is called **Model-Centric
    AI**, and that’s what you are taught in school.

    to spend significantly more time preparing your data than on building the model,
    especially since the use of pre-trained models and ML libraries becomes more and
