- en: We recently realized that we hadn't brought you any data science cheatsheets
    in a while. And it's not for their lack of availability; data science cheatsheets
    are everywhere, ranging from the introductory to the advanced, covering topics
    from algorithms, to statistics, to interview tips, and beyond.

    out as a particularly good one? It's difficult to put your finger on *precisely*
    what makes a good cheatsheet, but obviously one which conveys essential information
    concisely — whether that information is of a specific of general nature — is definitely
    a good start. And that is what makes our candidates today noteworthy. So read
    on for four curated complementary cheatsheets to assist you in your data science
    learning or review.

- en: First up is **[Aaron Wang's Data Science Cheatsheet 2.0](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet/blob/main/Data_Science_Cheatsheet.pdf)**,
    a four page compilation of statistical abstractions, fundamental machine learning
    algorithms, and deep learning topics and concepts. It is not meant to be exhaustive,
    but instead a quick reference for situations such as interview preparation and
    exam reviews, and anything else requiring a similar level of review depth. The
    author notes that while those with a basic understanding of statistics and linear
    algebra would find this resource of most benefit, beginners should be able to
    glean useful information from its content as well.

    on, **[Maverick Lin's Data Science Cheatsheet](https://github.com/ml874/Data-Science-Cheatsheet/blob/master/data-science-cheatsheet.pdf)**
    (Wang's reference to his own as 2.0 is a direct nod to Lin's "original"). We can
    think of Lin's cheatsheet as more in-depth than Wang's (though Wang's decision
    to make his less in-depth seems intentional and a useful alternative), covering
    more fundamental data science concepts such as data cleaning, the idea of modeling,
    doing "big data" with Hadoop, SQL, and even the basics of Python.

    and does a good job of whetting appetites and making readers aware of the broad
    field of data science, and many of the varying concepts which it encompasses.
    This is definitely another solid resource, especially if the reader is newcomer
    to data science.

- en: As we move further back in time — seeking the inspiration for Lin's cheatsheet
    — we come across **[William Chen's Probability Cheatsheet 2.0](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3241e4b0f0d81bf7ff36/t/55e9494fe4b011aed10e48e5/1441352015658/probability_cheatsheet.pdf)**.
    Chen's cheatsheet has garnered much attention and praise over the years, and so
    you may have come across it at some point. Clearly with a different focus (given
    its name), Chen's cheatsheet is a crash course on, or deep dive review of, probability
    concepts, including a variety of distributions, covariance and transformations,
    conditional expectation, Markov chains, various formulas of importance, and much
    more.

- en: At 10 pages, you should be able to imagine the breadth of probability topics
    being covered herein. But don't let that deter you; Chen's ability to boil concepts
    down to their essential bullet points and explain in plain English while not sacrificing
    on essentials is noteworthy. It is also rich in explanatory visualizations, something
    quite useful when space is limited and the desire to be concise is strong.

- en: Not only is Chen's compilation a quality one and worthy of your time, as a beginner
    or someone interested in a full review, I would work in reverse order of how these
    resources were presented — from Chen's cheatsheet, to Lin's, and finally to Wang's,
    building on top of concepts as you go.

    is **[Rishabh Anand''s Machine Learning Bites](https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-Bites-7c1675ecb587451e9caf793c68972276)**.
    Billing itself as "[a]n interview guide on common Machine Learning concepts, best
    practices, definitions, and theory," Anand has compiled a wide ranging collection
    of knowledge "bites," the usefulness of which definitely transcends the originally
    intended interview preparation. Topics covered within include:'

    touched on, as promised in the resource's description of itself, these "bites"
    are definitely geared toward the practical, which makes the site complementary
    to much of the material covered in the three previously mentioned cheatsheets.
    If I were looking to cover all of the material in all four of the resources in
    this post, I would certainly look at this after the other three.

    resource) to use for your learning or review. Hopefully something here is useful
    for you, and I invite anyone to share the cheatsheets they have found useful in
    the comments below.
