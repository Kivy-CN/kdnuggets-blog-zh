    the field meant that the hard part was over. After a few years of working in the
    industry, however, I have come to realize that I couldn’t have been more wrong.

    the position. I quit a data science internship **one week** after I joined, since
    I felt as though the tasks I was assigned had nothing to do with all the skills
    I’d painstakingly learnt.

    and put all the skills you’ve acquired over the years in practice. However, on
    your first day at the job, you realize that the company has massive amounts of
    unstructured data entering the system that hasn’t been formatted or processed
    in any way.

    present this data to stakeholders so they can use it to make business decisions.

    complaints I’ve heard from data scientists around me. Many of them had very different
    expectations of what their job scope would entail, but ended up performing data
    reporting and analysis tasks on a daily basis.

    become data or reporting analysts.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, it is important to pick a company that will allow you to work on what
    you like. Steer clear of companies that have every tool stack listed on their
    job description. Before you apply, find these companies on LinkedIn and look at
    whether they’ve hired for a data science position before. If they haven’t, you
    might want to stay away, since it means that you’ll likely be made to perform
    every data related task there is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they have, find the profiles of these data scientists and check the description
    they entered for the role. See if it aligns with your expectations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Make sure your interview process isn’t one-sided. Ask the interviewer as many
    questions as you can about the job scope and what it entails. If it doesn’t align
    with your expectations, then it might be better for you to look elsewhere.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, make sure to spend some time gaining domain knowledge in the field
    you’re working in. Use this knowledge to ask your managers the right questions,
    and ensure that their expectations are aligned to the potential project outcome.
