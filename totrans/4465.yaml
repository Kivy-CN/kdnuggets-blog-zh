- en: When it comes to the field of natural language processing, it ends up that we
    are actually talking about a very broad number of related concepts, techniques,
    and approaches. Word vectors, dependency parsing, text classification, regular
    expressions, language models, speech translation; these can all be lumped together
    under the banner of NLP, though they are very different tasks and techniques.

- en: Given the very broad and wide ranging nature of this field — a field which is
    developing at a rapid pace — gaining a strong foundation of basic concepts, and
    doing so in a practical manner, should be viewed as being of high importance.
    This week's highlighted free eBook, [**Natural Language Processing with Python**](https://www.nltk.org/book/),
    is a great way to help achieve this strong foundation.

- en: The [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) is a general
    purpose NLP library that, while not generally viewed as a choice for production
    systems, is well-suited to teaching and learning how to implement some of the
    fundamental concepts of NLP. This accompanying book is designed specifically to
    guide a reader through this learning process.

- en: This book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of NLP. It
    can be used for individual study or as the textbook for a course on natural language
    processing or computational linguistics, or as a supplement to courses in artificial
    intelligence, text mining, or corpus linguistics. The book is intensely practical,
    containing hundreds of fully-worked examples and graded exercises.

    write programs that analyze written language, regardless of previous programming
    experience.

- en: As stated above, the book is definitely of a practical nature. While you will
    assuredly have concepts explained as you go, there is little doubt that the book
    is crafted as a launchpad for those looking to get going with implementing NLP
    solutions with Python, and doing so *now*.

- en: It should be noted that this version of the free online book has had its code
    updated to Python 3, as the original version, now a decade old, was written in
    Python 2\. Also note that the book is not available as a PDF download, but instead
    is freely available on its site in HTML format.

- en: The book starts off slow — describing NLP, how Python can be used to perform
    some NLP programming tasks, how to access natural language content to process
    — and moves on to bigger concepts, both conceptually (NLP) programmatically (Python).
    Soon it gets to categorization, text classification, information extraction, and
    other topics more often thought of as classic NLP. After getting the basics of
    NLP with this book, you can move on to more modern and cutting edge techniques,
    perhaps through the use of materials such as some of Stanford's [free](/2020/05/best-nlp-deep-learning-course-free.html)
    [courses](/2020/06/languages-information-another-great-nlp-course-stanford.html).

    This is great book to start out with, and one which can be absorbed relatively
    quickly given its short length, meaning you can move on to more advanced topics
    in short order.
