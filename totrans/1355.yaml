    although it is not absolutely accurate. Furthermore, if you continuously retrieve
    random samples from the same population, it is expected that the point estimate
    would vary from sample to sample.

    average height of **x̅** =175 cm. You might get close to the population’s real
    height (**μ)**, but the chances are that the true value is somewhere between 170
    cm and 180 cm. It is most accurate to say that the average height for men in your
    city is somewhere between a specific interval [170 cm, 180 cm].

    never say you are 100% confident since for that you would have to go through the
    entire population (i.e., all men in the city). Therefore, there is still a 5%
    chance that the population parameter is outside the expected range.
