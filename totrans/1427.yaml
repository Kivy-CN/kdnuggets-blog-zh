    you were given an introduction to ultralearning and an effective strategy for
    implementing metalearning. With that, you can begin your voyage into the journey
    of ultralearning data science.

    is full of distractions. We live in a time where our attention is cheaply sold
    and the concept of the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) is
    treating our attention as a valuable currency.

- en: One example of this is setting a timer for five minutes. First, you promise
    yourself that you can stop working after those five minutes. This impetus provided
    by the promise that you stop in a short amount of time will usually keep a person
    going and continue working.
  id: totrans-23

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一个例子是设置一个五分钟的计时器。首先，你承诺自己在这五分钟后可以停止工作。这个由承诺带来的短时间内停止的动力通常会让人继续工作下去。
- en: 'This strategy of tricking yourself is parallel to the prominent *Pomodoro technique*:
    set a [timer](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) for 25 minutes and work without any
    distractions whatsoever, and without stopping. When the timer goes off, you take
    a five-minute break. Then, go back to another 25 minutes after that.'
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这种自我欺骗的策略与著名的*番茄钟技巧*类似：设置一个[timer](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/)为25分钟，并在没有任何干扰的情况下工作，不中断。当计时器响起时，休息五分钟。然后，再继续工作25分钟。
- en: This self-created sense of urgency and rewarding oneself with breaks in between
    focused work is particularly useful and is proven to be very productive. As the
    amount of focused work increases, the duration of breaks will also increase proportionally
    (five minutes to 10/15 minutes).
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 自创的紧迫感和在专注工作间隙奖励自己休息是特别有效的，且被证明非常高效。随着专注工作的时间增加，休息的时长也会成比例增加（从五分钟到10/15分钟）。
- en: Conversely, some would prefer to continue after the 25 minutes of focused work
    as it has already given you the momentum to keep on working, and then only take
    a break after an hour.

  zh: 相反，有些人更愿意在25分钟的专注工作后继续工作，因为它已经给了你继续工作的动力，然后在一个小时后再休息。
- en: This alternative is called the*52/17 technique*. It has recently gained popularity
    and is even titled as the ideal productivity schedule. Thus, according to your

    materials and modes of learning.
  id: totrans-47

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, to ensure retention of new concepts, you have to interleave by tackling
    your data science project in *short, regularly spaced sessions.* Say, if you have
    10 hours in your week to devote to learning about Python, aim for five two-hour
    sessions every week rather than one ten-hour session in one day.

    of [*timeboxing*](https://hbr.org/2018/12/how-timeboxing-works-and-why-it-will-make-you-more-productive)—
    a term that comes from agile software development, in which a time box is a *defined* period
    during which a task must be accomplished.
  id: totrans-51
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With timeboxing, only a limited amount of time (timebox) is given to complete
    one task, after the time has ended, you move forward to the next one, even if
    the task before is not complete. This ensures productive work and prevents an
    individual from spending too much time on one particular task.

    give debugging code about 15–20 minutes.
