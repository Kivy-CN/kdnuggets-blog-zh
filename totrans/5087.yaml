- en: At [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), our students often ask us whether
    they should use R and/or Python for their day-to-day data analysis tasks. Although
    we mainly offer [interactive R tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses), we
    always answer that this choice depends on the type of data analytical challenge
    that they are facing.

- en: Both Python and R are popular programming languages for statistics.  While R’s
    functionality is developed with statisticians in mind (think of R's strong data
    visualization capabilities!), Python is often praised for its easy-to-understand
    syntax.

    created the open-source language R in 1995 as an implementation of the S programming
    language. The purpose was to develop a language that focused on delivering a better
    and more user-friendly way to do data analysis, statistics and graphical models.
    At first, R was primarily used in academics and research, but lately the enterprise
    world is discovering R as well. This makes R one of the fastest growing statistical
    languages in the corporate world.'

    mailing lists, user-contributed documentation and a very active Stack Overflow
    group. There is also [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/), a huge repository of
    curated R packages to which users can easily contribute.  These packages are a
    collection of R functions and data that make it easy to immediately get access
    to the latest techniques and functionalities without needing to develop everything

    relatively low.

    is the Python Package index and consists of libraries to which users can contribute.
    Just like R, Python has a great community but it is a bit more scattered, since
    it’s a general purpose language. Nevertheless, Python for data science is rapidly
    claiming a more dominant position in the Python universe: the expectations are
    growing and more innovative data science applications will see their origin here.'

    of R and Python. While these figures often give a good indication on how these
    two languages are evolving in the overall ecosystem of computer science, it’s
    hard to compare them side-by-side.  The main reason for this is that you will
    find R only in a data science environment; As a general purpose language, Python,
    on the other hand, is widely used in many fields, such as web development. This
    often biases the ranking results in favor of Python, while the salaries are affected
    somewhat negatively.
