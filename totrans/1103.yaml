- en: Early in my career, working as a data analyst, I, like many people, dreamed
    of doing something significant and valuable for people. I wanted to be creative.
    I wanted to feel the results of my work, not just study the data. I worked at
    several startup companies for ten years before co-founding an e-commerce recommendation
    services company in 2012\. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, I went on sabbatical
    for a year — wrote a book, released it on Amazon, and left the successful company
    (positive cash flow, 150+ employees in Russia, Europe, and South America) entirely
    in the summer of 2021\. Now I am developing my next project from scratch.

    my startup. This post complements chapter 12 (“Challenges and Startups”) of my [book](https://topdatalab.com/book)

    product. If you have an idea, the best way to test it is to implement it in your
    current work for the company''s benefit. For example, my project was born many
    years before my partners and I started our company. I was developing recommendation
    systems as a side project when I was still employed. So I knew right away what
    to do and how to do it, especially initially. I could create a minimum viable
    product (MVP) with my eyes closed.'

    engineering). It is essential to be able to scale a product with minimal effort.
    To do this, you need to learn the practice of putting models into production.
    In addition to Python and SQL, it is a good idea to know some compiled programming
    languages (Java, Scala, C#, C++). Understanding how to use different types of
    databases and Hadoop is helpful. I found it very helpful to visit the Netflix
    office, where I received some advice about open source software and Hadoop. It
    took me about six months to learn and implement Hadoop. I also heard about Spark
    at an O''Reilly STRATA conference video. We were among the first to implement
    Spark in production.'

    very quickly and still get guaranteed results. Suppose you have a choice between
    two ML algorithms. In that case, the first is difficult to develop and theoretically
    gives better results. The second is simple, but its metrics are average — I will
    always choose the easier one as step number one. Yes, you can put the first algorithm
    in the backlog of hypotheses, but you’ll probably change it in a few months.'

- en: I spent two years on one short-term recommendation algorithm [4]. We did many
    complicated things. Ultimately the simplest version of the algorithm won all A/B
    tests. Trying to find the perfect algorithm was a waste of time in my case.

- en: '**The theory is not always the same as practice.** I’ve spent the last ten
    years developing recommendation algorithms for e-commerce. Scientific articles
    on the subject use standard metrics (Precision, Recall, Novelty, Diversity [2]).
    It would seem, take a scientific paper and do it. This approach works well in
    computer vision, for example, but not in my field. A purchase is a deferred event.
    The buyer can make it in a few hours or even days. So there is no direct correlation
    between accuracy metrics [1] and visitor conversion to buyers.'

- en: Another point — the recommendation algorithm changes user behavior. When you
    do offline testing on users’ past actions in logs — you don’t consider this. This
    factor also contributes to the error in predicting online performance in A/B tests
    with offline testing.

    metric for your ML model, and everything will work out. Unfortunately, it doesn’t.
    Have you heard about the problems of classification metrics in healthcare? For
    example, you have two different COVID PCR tests:'

    harm. Test B will miss more sick people, and they will spread the disease. The
    choice of the test is a complicated question; it will depend on the circumstances.
    You will face the same choice after A/B testing two different algorithms. For
    example, I’ve encountered situations in recommendation systems where the algorithm
    improved the commercial metric, but the recommendations themselves visually looked
    worse. Such an “improvement” is hard to sell to customers.

    to program in the evenings and weekends myself. I even bought myself a second
    laptop, which I carried with me to my current job, so that I could sometimes program
    there as well. In the evenings after work, I was getting tired, so there were
    a lot of mistakes in the code I was writing. I had to fix them all the next day.
    I found even some of them several years later. So try to find an opportunity to
    devote yourself fully to your project. It will save you a lot of effort and time
    in the future.'

- en: '**The importance of professional experience.** With it, it is easier to succeed
    without attracting significant investments. But for the lack of experience, you
    will have to pour out money. That is why it is good to work in actively developing
    companies to learn a lot. My former boss once gave me this advice. And if you
    have also worked on the side of your potential client, it will be much easier
    for you to understand their needs. It''s common knowledge that a customer won''t
    tell you everything during a product interview. Many issues are difficult to understand,
    even for a client himself. My experience as an analyst in e-commerce has helped
    me a lot. I created my first startup based on the knowledge gained there.'

    less investment, fewer employees, and the average transaction check is much higher
    there. You need to get far fewer customers to break even in B2B than if you did
    it in B2C.'

    companies. Your company and internal culture are unique. Simply stringing together
    templates of any standards such as development, ML model deployment, or product
    will not work. Any of them are in question; you''re more likely to create your
    rules based on common sense and appropriate for you.'

- en: '**Clouds are better for getting started**. Now the cloud is like a Lego constructor - you
    don''t have to think about hardware and software issues, and it''s relatively
    easy to scale. I did my first project on rented hardware. I deployed Hadoop there
    and set up all the computation algorithms. I immediately started creating the
    second project in the cloud, spending much less time on it.'

    analytical product is much more complex to sell than a system that raises a client''s
    sales. And suppose this effect is also easy to check, for example, in Google Analytics.
    In that case, your product will sell like hotcakes. That''s why I did not create
    an analytics project but went straight to where the data increases sales directly ---for
    example, to recommender systems.'
