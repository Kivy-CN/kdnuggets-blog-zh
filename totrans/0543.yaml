- en: Data engineering is a fascinating field. You get to work with a variety of interesting
    data, cutting-edge technologies, as well as with diverse teams of data professionals
    and domain experts. The entire field of data engineering is relatively new. As
    a data engineer, your role is crucial to the company’s success — many data professionals,
    including data analysts and data scientists, rely on you in order to do their
    work. You are responsible for equipping them with data that is always available,
    reliable, and in a proper structure.

    generated from it. And they are willing to pay you well if you are good at it!

    future career prospects, and how to approach the technical interview.

    you need to know **the most important services for storage, compute, networking,
    and databases**. If you don’t know much about those, I highly recommend learning
    Amazon Web Services — even if you would end up using Google Cloud Platform or
    Microsoft Azure, the concepts learned from AWS can be easily applied when switching
    to a different cloud vendor since many services across cloud vendors are analogous,
    and their concepts are virtually the same (*ex. block storage vs. object storage
    vs. NFS*).

    you can find **great free courses on AWS **— they are **all offered directly from
    AWS. **You don’t need to pay for the extra certificate — from my experience, recruiters
    and **engineering managers don’t really care that much about certifications**.
    They want people with hands-on experience who know a lot and can apply it to business
    problems.

    bringing it to a form appropriate for analysis, and then loading it to some data
    lake or data warehouse. You should have **some experience in creating ETL**. It
    doesn’t mean that you must have worked on a Big Data project for some large companies
    — even **your self-driven projects** shared on Github or in a blog post can get
    you far in the application process and make you stand out from the crowd.

    is always available, reliable, and in a proper structure. To achieve this, you
    need to schedule and monitor your data pipelines. Many companies use workflow
    management systems such as [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) or [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) for
    this purpose, so knowing one of them may significantly improve your chances of
    getting a great data engineering job. If you want **to learn more about those,
    read my previous stories**, such as [this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/distributed-data-pipelines-made-easy-with-aws-eks-and-prefect-106984923b30) —

    because you upgraded to a new pandas version. Containerization is key, so **being
    able to work with containerized workloads** is one of the most crucial and most
    in-demand skills in (any) engineering jobs, as it makes your code self-contained,
    dependency-free and lets you deploy your code to *virtually* any environment.

    files*), which can then be deployed via **Command Line Interface (*****CLI*****)**.
    This paradigm is often known as **Infrastructure as Code**. For instance, AWS
    CLI allows you to provision an entire cluster of resources simply by submitting
    bash commands to the AWS API. Other cloud providers (*such as GCP or Azure*) offer
    similar command-line interfaces.
