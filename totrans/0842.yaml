    are different tools and platforms available to not only automate the entire process
    of creating a model but to even help you to select the best model for a particular
    data set.

    is a dataset that contains all the required attributes describing the problem
    you are trying to solve.. So, suppose we are looking at a dataset describing the
    diabetes history of patients. There will be specific columns that are the significant
    attributes like age, gender, glucose level, etc. which play an essential role
    in predicting whether a person has diabetes or not. In order to build a diabetes
    prediction model, we can find multiple datasets that are publicly available. However,
    we may face difficulty in solving problems where data is not readily available
    or highly imbalanced.

- en: Synthetic data generated by deep learning algorithms is often used in replacement
    of original data when data access is limited by privacy compliance or when the
    original data needs to be augmented to fit specific purposes.  Synthetic data
    mimics the real data by recreating the statistical properties. Once trained on
    real data, the synthetic data generator can create any amount of data that closely
    resembles the patterns, distributions, and dependencies of the real data. This
    not only helps generate similar data but also helps in introducing certain constraints
    to the data, such as new distributions. . Let's explore some use cases where synthetic
    data can play an important role.

    even telecom can be extremely sensitive. Touching this data usually requires special
    permissions for each project., Synthetic data generation can unlock these data

- en: Generative AI models are crucial in synthetic data production since they are
    explicitly trained on the original dataset and can replicate its traits and statistical
    attributes. Models of generative AI, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), comprehend the underlying data and produce
    realistic and representative synthetic instances.

    out there, some better than others. When evaluating the performance of synthetic
    data generators, it’s important to look at two aspects: accuracy and privacy.
    Accuracy needs to be high without the synthetic data overfitting the original
    data and the extreme values present in the original data need to be handled in
    a way that doesn’t endanger the privacy of data subjects. Some synthetic data
    generators offer automated privacy and accuracy checks - it’s a good idea to start
    with these first. [MOSTLY AI’s synthetic data generator](https://mostly.ai/synthetic-data-platform/generate-synthetic-data)

    GDPR and similar privacy laws, allowing data scientists to freely explore the
    synthetic versions of datasets. Synthetic data is also one of the best tools to
    anonymize behavioral data without destroying patterns and correlations. These
    two qualities make it especially useful in all situations when personal data is
    used - from simple analytics to training sophisticated machine learning models.
