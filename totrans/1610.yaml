- en: The frontiers between software and hardware are fascinating. We, Data Scientists,
    are used to develop Machine Learning algorithms for business purposes, and frequently
    the outputs of these models are measured in terms of profit, cost savings and
    even intangible outputs, like customer satisfaction. Of course we can visualize
    the outputs of our models using dashboards like Power BI, Tableau or in the cloud,
    with Kibana, Quick Sight or Tago. But it’s quite rewarding to see outcomes of
    our models in the physical world, outside a screen.

    generate alerts in dashboards regarding malfunctions in a given system, like saturation
    of BTSs (base transceiver station), the nodes where telecommunications signals
    pass through. Now imagine that besides of an alert in a dashboard, we automatically
    redirect telecom data traffic to a different anthem so that Point-of-Sales (POS)
    remain connected all the time. This would leverage acquirers’ profit and merchants’
    satisfaction. We may even adjust settings of a machine in the real world.

    meters, cane grinders, Libelium sets (for agriculture), elevators, health appliances
    send telemetry data that can be analyzed in order to develop Predictive Maintenance
    models, so that businesses can cut costs and increasy efficiency, at the same
    time they optimize logistics. In these cases, connectivity can be achieved using
    SimCards, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or radio signals (LoRa).

    between the device (temperature, humidity sensor) and the cloud. In my previous
    post I explained how to turn your notebook into an IoT device, providing details
    on how to send data to AWS, from the device to the dashboard, in an end-to-end
    solution ([kdnuggets.com/2018/06/zimbres-iot-aws-machine-learning-dashboard.html](/2018/06/zimbres-iot-aws-machine-learning-dashboard.html)).

    without graphical interface, using Ubuntu Core in a Raspberry Pi 3\. An easier
    way is to use Raspbian, that provides a graphical interface for your projects.
    Raspbian is a Debian-based computer operating system. However, I decided to try
    Ubuntu Core, given that security should be a main concern in IoT. Ubuntu Core
    can be used for digital signage, robotics, drones and edge gateways. A more challenging
    and secure decision.

    of snaps, “self contained, isolated and protected bits of code”. It’s quite difficult
    to alter a read-only file in the system, even using ESC :w !sudo tee % at vim
    command.

- en: As it is an ARM system, it’s quite different to install Machine Learning libraries
    in it, since there are some specific packages for this type of system and lots
    of dependencies are not included, not even “wget”. So let’s start. When you buy
    a Raspberry, it comes without the energy source (top right below) and without
    the SDCard (prominence at right). Model 3 B comes with 4 USB entries and an ethernet
    entry. It also contains the HDMI, audio and camera entries. In this project we
    will not use the mouse, and monitor, ethernet cable and keyboard are only used
    in the first run of the system, to set up the internet connection.
