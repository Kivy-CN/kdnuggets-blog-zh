    the tail-end of 2021, no longer nascent fields with uncertain futures ahead of
    them. AI and ML have grown to become massively influential spheres of influence
    on the broader world of data science, a fact that [has remained truer than](/2021/12/trends-ai-data-science-ml-technology.html)

    so too have the parameters that can make or break the success of data science
    teams. The opportunities to obtain significant and profound insights from the
    fields of AI and ML are predicated on data science teams that are larger than
    simply one data scientist operating with a single laptop. There's simply too much
    data that needs to be obtained, cleaned, and prepared for analysis - a process
    that consumes a significant portion of a data scientist's average workday - for
    any one person to handle alone.

- en: Modern data science projects revolve around important information regarding
    data preparation, prior data science projects, and potential ways forward to deploy
    data models that must be shared with multiple data sciences. Therefore, it’s crucial
    to investigate the reasons why data science teams require context, consistency,
    and secure collaboration of their data to ensure data science success. Let's quickly
    examine each of these requirements so that we can better understand what data
    science success moving forward may look like.

    can last long without institutional knowledge that is documented, stored, and
    made available to data scientists. And, yet, a great deal of institutional knowledge
    is regularly lost because of a lack of proper documentation and storage.'

    because of a lack of context. These ad-hoc team members need context to know more
    about the data with which they''re interacting, the people that have addressed
    problems in the past, and how previous work influenced the current project landscape.'

    can easily distract a team of data scientists, let alone a single one operating
    alone. Leaders may consider the option to [hire a freelance developer](https://www.waveapps.com/freelancing/web-development/front-end-developer-salary)
    to contribute their time toward the preservation and dissemination of institutional
    knowledge to improve the standard review and feedback sessions of modern data
    science projects. These sessions as well as software systems, workbenches, and
    best practices can streamline the more effective capture of project-related context
    that improves data discoverability of junior and citizen data scientists in the
    future.

    are likely to struggle with onboarding and the meaningful contribution to their
    projects, which in turn leads to teams re-creating projects rather than contributing
    to previous work.

- en: The fields of ML and AI have contributed to foundational changes when it comes
    to financial services, the health and life sciences, and manufacturing; these
    industries, though, are subject to significant regulatory environments. This means
    that an AI project that takes place in a regulated environment must be reproducible
    with a clear audit trail. In other words, IT and business leaders who are in some
    way, shape, or form involved with a data science project need to [ensure a level
    of data consistency](/2019/12/data-catalog.html) when it comes to their data science
    project's results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IT and business leaders who can expect a reliable level of consistency can also
    enjoy more confidence when it comes time to make the types of strategic shifts
    that AI facilitates. There's plenty at stake when it comes to data science projects
    and there's a lot of investment riding on them, so data scientists deserve an
    infrastructure in which they can operate with a guaranteed level of reproducibility
    [from start to finish](https://fiorreports.com/why-context-consistency-and-collaboration-are-the-keys-to-data-science-success/).
    This full reproducibility translates into the consistency in data that top executives
    are looking for in order to decide whether or not a data science project is sufficiently
    significant and in alignment with their business objectives.

    so too will the necessary training sets and hardware requirements to ensure consistency
    in results from older projects. Therefore, processes and systems that help manage
    an environment are an absolute necessity for a data science team expansion. If,
    for example, a data scientist is using a laptop while a data engineer is running
    a different version of a library running on a cloud VM, that data scientist may
    see their data model producing different results from one machine to the next.
    The bottom line: executives should ensure that their data collaborators have a
    consistent way of sharing the exact same software environments.'

    to shift their operations to a work-from-home model, organizations are realizing
    that data science collaboration is much more difficult than in-person collaboration.
    Although some core data science duties are manageable with the help of a single
    data science (data prep, research, and data model iteration), the majority of
    business executives have mistakenly left collaboration by the wayside and have
    subsequently hindered remote productivity.

    participants as well as the security of project data? The answer lies in shareable
    work files and data pertaining to a data science project [that make it more viable](https://nordicapis.com/top-3-global-standards-that-impact-personal-data-sharing-with-apis/)
    to disseminate information remotely. And as dissemination of project-related data
    becomes simpler, the simpler it becomes to share information, the easier it is
    to facilitate remote data collaboration. Participants of a data science project
    can leverage cloud-based tools to strengthen the security behind their research.
    but too many leaders have made the mistake of not encouraging collaboration, reducing
    productivity.

    years has been unprecedented and frankly amazing. Data science’s progression has
    made it feasible for companies worldwide to address questions that previously
    had few, if any, readily available answers without the innovations that have been
    made possible by AI and ML.

    for top executives and the data science teams they oversee to migrate away from
    a more ad-hoc and reactive way of getting work done. Resources that data scientists
    can use to generate context, consistency and greater collaboration like software
    workbenches are likely to be essential to data science success. Ultimately, projects
    will demand less effort from the data scientists, engineers, analysts, and researchers,
    who will be better able to accelerate the field’s continued and astonishing success.
