    fact, people—both the often obscured human labor that makes large language models
    safer to use, and the individuals who make critical decisions on when and how
    to best use this technology. Reporting on people and influence is what TIME does
    best. That led us to the TIME100 AI.'

    into the categories of leaders, innovators, shapers, and thinkers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While there is an array of impressive names on the list in the various categories,
    there was some immediate discussion on Twitter of significant exclusions, with
    Jürgen Schmidhuber and Andrej Karpathy being two names that seemed to come up
    repeatedly. I had some oversights of my own that I would have added, along with
    several names I feel could have been left off, but it's not my list so there isn't
    much I can do about it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of complaining, I have decided to look at the list as a snapshot of
    how an influential popular publication is reporting on AI to the masses. As such,
    I would not endorse this as authoritative in any manner, but still choose to bring
    it to our readers for informational purposes.

- en: TIME’s most knowledgeable editors and reporters spent months fielding recommendations
    from dozens of sources, to put together hundreds of nominations that we whittled
    down to the group you see today. We interviewed nearly all of the individuals
    on this list to get their perspective on the path of AI today.

- en: Whether or not you agree fully with the inclusions, I feel that it is still
    important to know what popular publications are reporting to the masses about
    the AI industry. I would imagine that even the most well-versed follower of the
    AI landscape would encounter some unfamiliar names with which to familiarize themselves.

    into contemporary AI leaders, and — just as importantly — get an understanding
    of how those outside of the industry see it.
