    data acquisition, handling and model creation is discussed, but the evaluation
    aspect too often is very brief. But I truly believe it''s the most important fact,
    when building a new model. Consequently, the first post on this blog will deal
    with a pretty useful evaluation technique: lift analysis.'

    Lift analysis, however, is used for classification tasks. Therefore, the remainder

    to assess performance. There are things like accuracy, precision-recall, ROC curve
    and so on. All of them can be useful, but they can also be misleading or don't
    answer the question at hand very well.

- en: 'Accuracy [1] for example might be a useful metric for balanced classes (that
    is, each label has about the same number of occurrences), but it''s totally misleading
    for imbalanced classes. Problem is: data scientists have to deal with imbalanced
    classes all the time, e.g. when predicting if a user will buy something in an
    online shop. If only 2 out of 100 customers buy anyway, it''s easy for the model
    to predict everyone as not buying and it still would achieve an accuracy of 98%!
    That''s absolutely not useful, when trying to assess the model''s quality.'

    about your model as well. But I want to dig a bit deeper into another valuable
    evaluation technique, generally referred to as lift analysis.

    if a customer of an online service will cancel its subscription or not. This is
    a binary classification problem: the user either cancels the subscription (*churn=1*)
    or keeps it (*churn=0*).'

    cancel its subscription. This means our predicted (churn) probability should be
    directly proportional to the true churn probability, i.e. a high predicted score
    should correlate with a high actual churn rate. Vice versa, if the model predicts
    that a customer won't churn, then we want to be sure that it's *really unlikely*
    that this customer will churn.

    as expected. For scores below 0.5, the actual churn rate in the buckets is almost
    zero. You can use this lift chart to verify that your model is doing what you
    expect from it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say there would be a spike in the lower scored groups; then you know right
    away that your model has some flaw, it doesn't reflect the reality properly. Because
    if it would, then the true churn rate can only decrease with decreasing score.
    Of course, lift analysis can help you only that far. It's up to you to identify
    the cause of this problem and to fix it, if necessary [2]. After improving the
    model, you just can come back to the lift chart and see if the quality improved.

    This is useful to define a targeting threshold: scores below the threshold will
    be set to 0, scores above to 1\. In our example, you might want to try to keep
    customers from cancelling their subscription by giving them a discount. Then you
    would target all users with a score between 0.8 and 1.0, because this is the range
    where the churn rates are *higher than the average churn rate*. You don''t want
    to pour money down the drain for customers, who have a below-average churn probability.'

    / 0.2 = 4.85 and the second highest group of 1.8\. That means, if you only target
    users with a score higher than 0.9, you can expect to catch nearly five times
    more churning users than you would by targeting the same number of people randomly.

- en: Just like every other evaluation metric lift charts aren't an one-off solution.
    But they help you get a better picture of the overall performance of your model.
    You can quickly spot flaws, if the slope of the lift chart is not monotonic. Additionally,
    it helps you to set a threshold, which users are worth targeting. Last but not
    least, you have a estimate how much better you can target users compared to random
    targeting.
