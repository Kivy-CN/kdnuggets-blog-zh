- en: Data Engineering is one of the most sought out job in the market these days.
    Data is everywhere and is considered to be the oil of the new age. Companies generate
    a large amount of data from different sources and the task of a Data Engineer
    is to organize the collection of data information, it’s processing and storage.
    However, to become a Data Engineer, you need to have some excellent skills like
    Databases, Big data, ETL & Data Warehousing, Cloud computing as well programming
    languages. But the question arises, do you want to have all these skills or do
    you experience using all the tools? This is the biggest dilemma specially in technologies
    where there is buffet of tools available to get things done.

    skill set observations in the Data Engineering Job Market which could definitely
    add a boost to your existing career or assist you in starting off your Data Engineering
    journey.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, programming language is a required skill for Data Engineering. Majority
    of the job profiles requires proficiency in at least one programming language.
    These languages are required to code the ETL or data pipeline framework. Common
    programming languages are the core programming skills needed to grasp data engineering
    and pipelines generally.  Among other things, Java and Scala are used to write
    MapReduce jobs on Hadoop; Python is a popular pick for data analysis and pipelines,
    and Ruby is also a popular application glue across the board.

- en: Python! Python! Python! Yes, around 70% of the job profiles has Python as the
    required skill followed by SQL, Java, Scala and other programming skills like
    R, .Net, Perl, Shell Scripting etc.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data processing is the collecting and manipulation of data into the usable and
    desired form. Apache Spark topped the list for the data processing layer followed
    by AWS Lambda, Elasticsearch, MapReduce, Oozie, Pig, AWS EMR etc. Apache Spark
    is a powerful open-source framework that provides interactive processing, real-time
    stream processing, batch processing, and in-memory processing at very fast speeds,
    standard interface, and ease of use.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For any data which require analysis or processing, first it needs to be collected
    or ingested into the data pipeline. Rest APIs are the commonly utilized tool for
    this purpose followed by Sqoop, Nifi, Azure Data Factory, Flume, Hue etc.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Buffering is a crucial piece in the Data Engineering framework where the
    data needs to be temporarily stored while it is being moved from one place to
    another to cater high volume. Apache Kafka is a commonly used distributed data
    store optimized for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time. Streaming
    data is data that is continuously generated by thousands of data sources, which
    typically send the data records in simultaneously. A streaming platform needs
    to handle this constant influx of data, and process the data sequentially and
    incrementally. Other tools in this category are Kinesis, Redis Cache, GCP Pub/Sub
    etc.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data needs to be stored for processing, analysis or visualization to generate
    valuable insights. Data store can be in the form of Data Warehouses, Hadoop, Databases
    (both RDBMS and NoSQL), Data Marts. SQL skills are mostly sought followed by Hive,
    AWS Redshift, MongoDB, AWS S3, Cassandra, GCP BigQuery etc.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data visualization is the representation of data or information in a graph,
    chart, or other visual format. It communicates relationships of the data with
    images. Tableau and PowerBI are ahead of the race followed by SAP Business Objects,
    Qlik, SPSS, QuickSight, MicroStrategy etc.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are different cloud or on-premise based platforms which can be leveraged
    to work on different Data Engineering set of tools. The typical ones listed are
    Hadoop, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Azure and Apprenda.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, one cannot be a master or experienced with all the skills & tools and
    it is definitely not mandatory to have all these skills. But typically required
    to have a strong hold on at least one of them in each data pipeline framework
    category like GCP for Cloud Platform, Python for Development, Apache Spark for
    Processing, Rest APIs for Data Collection, Apache Kafka for Data Buffering, Hive
    for Data Storage and PowerBI for Data Visualization.
