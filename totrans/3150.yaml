    keeps changing the names for this report (and by implication the market segment)
    - the latest 2018 version, published Feb 23, 2018, is called "Magic Quadrant for
    Data Science and Machine-Learning Platforms" (with an old-fashioned dash between
    Machine and Learning). In 2017 it was "MQ for Data Science Platforms", and in
    2014-2016 it was "MQ for Advanced Analytics Platforms". This change reflects the
    rapid changes in the industry, both in terms of content and capabilities. and
    the evolving branding which reflects the growth of AI and Machine Learning.'

- en: SAS remains a Leader, but has lost some ground in terms of both Completeness
    of Vision and Ability to Execute. The Visual Analytics suite shows promise because
    of its Viya cloud-ready architecture, which is more open than prior SAS architecture
    and makes analytics more accessible to a broad range of users. However, a confusing
    multiproduct approach has worsened SAS's Completeness of Vision, and a perception
    of high licensing costs has impaired its Ability to Execute. As the market's focus
    shifts to open-source software and flexibility, SAS's slowness to offer a cohesive,
    open platform has taken its toll.
