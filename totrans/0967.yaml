- en: As the data science industry continues to grow, I believe that it is important
    that people who are trying to enter the industry have a good sense of what they
    are getting themselves into. The aim of this article was for me to gain a deeper
    insight on the life of a senior Data Scientist and how their experience can be
    used as lessons for up and coming Data Scientists.

    at [Satellite Vu](https://www.satellitevu.com/). He comes from a Physics background
    having studied at The University of Southampton where he then went onto doing
    a Master in Optics and Photonics at Imperial College London. A year later, he
    went to The University of Cambridge where he gained a PhD in Physics.'

    Senior Data Scientist. He has skills in Data Analysis, Deep Learning, Data Engineering
    and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

- en: How did you get into data science?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I gained an undergraduate degree in Physics, in which I then went onto gain
    a PhD in Optical Physics. I then moved into the Research and Development field
    which consisted of programming. This is when I geared towards programming and
    went from working in labs and doing experiments to analyzing data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I specifically used machine learning to tackle a lot of the problems where I
    was working in the Satellite sector and was using computer vision models. I used
    deep learning with images as part of my study.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a variety of roles in the data science field, and can be used in many
    ways. For example, in the ecommerce sector, you can use SQL and other traditional
    solutions such as Random Forests to help create a product recommendation engine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my role in particular, I focus more on deep learning and capture images on
    an airplane through computer vision. This deep learning approach allows me to
    process that imagery in order to identify and locate items of interests and classes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My advice is that data science can mean different things to different people,
    therefore you need to explore the different areas and avenues of data science
    to see what interests you.

    two week sprints and daily stand ups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I start my day at 9 and respond to my emails whilst checking for papers and
    blogs that are useful towards my research and to expand my knowledge. My daily
    stand up happens at 9.30am in which our medium sized team updates one another
    on the progress of their tasks. The rest of the day consists of the execution
    of solo tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have a bi-weekly catch up where we use this time to go into depth on what
    we are doing. We also use this time to manage our progress. Once a month, the
    team has a catch up where we focus on data science training needs and infrastructure
    such as AWS.

- en: 'There are two routes Senior Data Scientists can typically go down: either they
    become more specialized in their field or they move onto a managerial role. For
    me in particular, if there are more Data Scientists hired in my team, I will possibly
    move onto becoming a Lead Data Scientist. I do not think too far ahead - as the
    business grows, my duties will naturally change.'
  prefs: []

- en: I am currently in the early stages of working on remote sensing data, therefore
    a lot of general research is still required. So I will be focusing on that for
    now as that is my interest.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before becoming a Data Scientist, I spent a year doing Data Engineering which
    helped me to improve my programming skills, specifically Python. There is a lot
    of competition for data science roles and I realized how my year as a Data Engineer
    helped me in my data science career.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was also the first person hired at the start-up I work at - so that meant
    I had multiple tech roles which allowed me to build skills, become more proficient
    and experienced.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Real world projects! As a Senior Data Scientists I get asked a lot of basic
    questions about projects which I believe is something that Data Scientists should
    know. When it comes to projects, a lot of online courses make you follow their
    guidelines which does not necessarily help you in the real world. I believe that
    Junior Data Scientists need to have the confidence to tackle projects by themselves.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are obvious shortcomings in Data Scientists who lack traditional education,
    for example real world project management, how they approach the work and choose
    to present it. Again, the difference is that Bootcamp students lack real world
    project experience, which is very important.

- en: When you see an opportunity - take it! My first ever machine learning project
    was when I wasn't even employed as a Data Scientist. I saw a small opportunity
    in which I could test, improve and show off my data science skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So my advice to up and coming Data Scientists is that if you see a small opportunity
    or area where you can show off your programming skills - do it! This provides
    you with real world experiences and makes you stand out from book smart students.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another piece of advice I would give is to find a mentor. Working with a more
    experienced person will allow you to bounce ideas off them and get feedback on
    what you're doing. You can also use open source platforms, get involved in kaggle
    competitions, or act as a volunteer on a project as it will be a good experience.
  prefs: []

- en: I myself learnt and improved my skills through side passion projects where I
    used these real world projects to build my portfolio. These can also be used to
    discuss at an interview which can make you stand out!
