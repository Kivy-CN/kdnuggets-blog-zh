    a raw model for the health industry as well as other industries. It disseminates
    knowledge and sharpens definitions for privacy data treatment methods. HIPAA differentiates
    Safe Harbour and Expert Determination methods. We will compare these data obfuscation
    approaches.

- en: “Safe Harbour” is a very catchy idea because it is based on a simple set of
    rules to remove well-defined identifiers.  For example, the first two identifiers
    are a person’s name and geographic subdivision smaller than a state. The full
    identifiers list can be found [here](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#standard).
    Apart from removing keys, we also need to ensure that there is no information
    left to identify individuals. This could be a challenge due to micro keys such
    as a very rare disease or unique treatment parameters. Safe Harbour is rule-based
    and is thus too inflexible to consider the actual content of the data and micro
    keys. The article [A Re-identification of Patients in Maine and Vermont Statewide
    Hospital Data](https://techscience.org/a/2018100901/) in the Technology Science
    journal demonstrated that 3.2% of Safe Harbor data had been re-identified to individuals
    using local publications.

    of Expert Determination over Safe Harbour. The main advantage of Expert Determination
    is that this method not only deals with the probability of disclosure but simultaneously
    allows us to control correspondent engendered information loss. The data sample
    obfuscated with the Expert Determination data example allows us to carry out the
    urban vs. rural research, and with Safe Harbour, it does not.
