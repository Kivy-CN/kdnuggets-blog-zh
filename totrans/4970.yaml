- en: Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual patterns that do not
    conform to expected behavior, called outliers. It has many applications in business,
    from intrusion detection (identifying strange patterns in network traffic that
    could signal a hack) to system health monitoring (spotting a malignant tumor in
    an MRI scan), and from fraud detection in credit card transactions to fault detection
    in operating environments.

    how to build a detector in Python using simple moving average (SMA) or low-pass
    filter.

    and novelty detection. **Novelty detection** is concerned with identifying an
    unobserved pattern in new observations not included in training data - like a
    sudden interest in a new channel on YouTube during Christmas, for instance. **Noise
    removal** ([NR](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/publication/tkdehcleaner.pdf)) is
    the process of immunizing analysis from the occurrence of unwanted observations;
    in other words, removing noise from an otherwise meaningful signal.

- en: The simplest approach to identifying irregularities in data is to flag the data
    points that deviate from common statistical properties of a distribution, including
    mean, median, mode, and quantiles. Let's say the definition of an anomalous data
    point is one that deviates by a certain standard deviation from the mean. Traversing
    mean over time-series data isn't exactly trivial, as it's not static. You would
    need a rolling window to compute the average across the data points. Technically,
    this is called a rolling average or a moving average, and it's intended to smooth
    short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term ones. Mathematically, an n-period
    simple moving average can also be defined as a "low pass filter." (A Kalman filter
    is a more sophisticated version of this metric; you can find a very intuitive
    explanation of it [here](http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/).)

    the boundary between normal and abnormal behavior is often not precise.

    constantly adapt themselves. Therefore, the threshold based on moving average
    may not always apply.

    such as decomposing the data into multiple trends in order to identify the change

    with supervised learning, but there are extensions ([OneClassCVM,](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.html)
    for instance) that can be used to identify anomalies as an unsupervised problems
    (in which training data are not labeled). The algorithm learns a soft boundary
    in order to cluster the normal data instances using the training set, and then,
    using the testing instance, it tunes itself to identify the abnormalities that
    fall outside the learned region.
