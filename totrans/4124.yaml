    say about newbies is their lack of applying their skills to projects or real-life
    problems. So with that being said, I thought it would be interesting if I created
    this quick 5-minute project to help apply and build your skills.

    not only is it simple, but it is also fun and interactive. I will show you two
    ways you can do it with Python.
