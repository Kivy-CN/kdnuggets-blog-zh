- en: This ‘Top 10’ list has been created on the basis of best content, and not exactly
    the number of views. To help you choose an appropriate framework, we first start
    with a video that compares few of the popular Python DL libraries. I have included
    the highlights and my views on the pros and cons of each of these 10 items, so
    you can choose one that best suits your needs. I have saved the best for last-
    the most comprehensive yet free YouTube course on DL ☺. Let’s begin!

- en: Before I actually list the best DL in Python videos, it is important that one
    understands the differences between the 5 most popular deep learning frameworks
    -SciKit Learn, TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, and Caffe. This 5 minute video by Siraj
    Raval gives you the best possible comparison between the pros and cons of each
    framework and even presents the structure of code samples to help you better decide.
    Start with this.

    is worth its weight in gold- excellent comments in the code; plus, the instructor
    speaks without interruption. Watch this video to understand scripts in TensorFlow.
    Thank me later☺

- en: In this video, Siraj Raval uses a special type of recurrent neural network called
    an LSTM network. He uses the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend. He explains
    the reason behind using recurrent nets for time series data and later, uses it
    to predict the daily closing price of the S&P 500 based on training data for 16
    years. The link to the Github code is given in its description box.

- en: If you want a talk on Python with the Theano library in under an hour, targeted
    towards beginners, then you can refer to this talk by Alec Radford. Unlike most
    other talks on this topic, this one compares the features of an ‘old’ net versus
    a ‘modern’ net, ie nets prior to 2000 versus nets post-2012.

    A highlight of this series is Lecture 10, where he teaches you to build a basic
    CNN with detailed emphasis of understanding the concept of CNN’s using his detailed
    diagrams.

    good tutorial for beginners in TensorFlow. It teaches TensorFlow basics and data
    structures. It also includes a usecase for using DL as a Naval Mine identifier-
    to identify whether an underwater obstacle is a rock or a mine.

- en: The YouTube channel ‘Machine Learning TV‘ has published a series of 15 videos
    totaling 83 minutes using Theano and Keras to use DL for automatic image captioning.
    It shows you how to train your first deep neural net for classifying digits from
    the MNIST dataset. It also has a good explanation on loading and reusing pre-trained
    models in Theano.

    I have saved the best for last☺ .If you want to learn Deep Learning as an online
    course from arguably the most famous ML instructor- Andrew Ng, then this playlist
    is for you. Intended as a 4-week course covering 98 videos, this course teaches
    you DL, Neural Networks, binary classification, derivatives, gradient descent,
    activation function, backpropagation, regularization, RMSprop, tuning, dropout,
    training and testing on different distributions, among others, using Python code
    in a Jupyter notebook.
