    because of the current hype, it is just a matter of time before AI becomes embedded
    into many daily business processes, including cybersecurity controls. But now,
    when this technology is still young, it can be difficult to understand the real
    implications and challenges of AI automation.'

    and provides IT and cybersecurity leaders with recommendations on how to make
    informed decisions about what to automate.

    if that were possible, we as a society are not ready for that leap. Imagine boarding
    a jet and noticing that no human pilot ever enters the cockpit prior to departure.
    No doubt there would be mutiny on board, with passengers demanding that a pilot
    be present for the flight. As effective as the autopilot function is, it has its
    limitations, so people still want a human in charge.

    took hold. While machinery did take over elements of manual labor, it didn’t replace
    the humans themselves. Rather, the machines brought greater efficiency, predictability
    and consistency to the manufacturing process. In fact, new jobs and even new industries
    requiring new skills and greater diversity were born. Similarly, AI will bring
    new levels of efficiency, scalability and accuracy to business processes, and
    also create new opportunities and transform the labor market. In other words,
    you will still need cybersecurity personnel, but they will be upskilled by AI
    assistance.

    costs. This may sound familiar; the same was said about the cloud not too long
    ago. Organizations that migrated their datacenters to the cloud found that while
    the OPEX cost structure of the cloud has advantages over traditional CAPEX expenditures,
    the final costs are similar for large environments, in part because more sophisticated
    systems require more skilled (and expensive!) talent. Likewise, automation will
    change the distribution of costs, but not the overall costs.

    a desirable goal. In reality, it is a pie-in-the-sky dream that raises questions
    of trust and auditability. What if that automation malfunctions or becomes compromised?
    How do you verify the outcomes are still aligned with the business objectives?
    The truth is that we are in the early stages of this new AI automated paradigm,
    and no one truly understands how AI automation might be exploited one day from
    a security perspective. AI and automation aren't silver bullets (nothing is).

    security logs, correcting misconfigurations or interpreting prescribed metric
    alerts. By equipping them with AI-driven security tools, you can increase their
    visibility, augment their understanding of different threats and expedite their
    responsiveness to attacks.

    to improve the performance of their athletes. Similarly, you need to provide your
    security teams with the automated tools they need to up their game. For example,
    the insider threat is a significant risk, but it is practically impossible to
    watch over every user in the company, and rogue employees are often only evident
    when they have already caused at least some damage. AI-based solutions can be
    much more efficient in reducing this risk: A user and entity behavior anomaly
    (UEBA) detection solution can spot subtle changes in a user’s data access patterns
    and differences between their behavior compared to their peers, both of which
    signal a potential risk that requires prompt review.'

    is threat hunting. Automated solutions can identify more accurately traces of
    attacks that may have been thwarted by your protection mechanisms and compare
    them to your threat intelligence. These may be signs of a larger attack and you
    can get better prepared for it.

    to experience AI in action. Working with their security teams, they can explore
    potential applications for the technology. But instead of blindly charging forward,
    it’s vital to thoroughly assess which processes make sense to automate. This due
    diligence will help IT leaders ensure that the risks of a proposed new technology
    does not exceed its benefits.
