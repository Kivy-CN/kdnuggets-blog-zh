- en: The hype over big data is on the wane. The cloud, Hadoop and their variants
    have solved it. But ‘big data’ is where a lot of people are still spending a lot
    of money building bigger infrastructures to process, hold and curate these immense
    databases. This blind pursuit of ‘big’ is generating some sizable and avoidable
    costs in infrastructure andhuman resources.

- en: It is now time to change the discussion from ‘big data’ to ‘deep data’. Instead
    of collecting all the possible data to achieve ‘big data’ we now need to be more
    thoughtful and judicious. We need to now let some data fall on the floor and seek
    out variety over volume and quality over quantity. This will have many long term
    benefits.

    Web Services charges you. It is also the additional complexity of finding and
    managing multiple data sources and the ‘virtual weight’ of moving and using that
    data by your staff. These costs are often higher than the storage and computation
    charges.

    comes to data:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**More of the same doesn’t help.** In building machine learning models for
    AI, diversity of training examples is critically important. The reason for this
    is that the models are trying to determine concept boundaries. For example,if
    your model is trying to define the concept of a ‘retired worker’ by using age
    and occupation then repeated examples of 32 year old Certified Public Accountants
    does the model little good since none of them are retired. It is much more helpful
    to get examples at the concept boundary of age 65 and to see how retirement varies
    with occupation.'

    it will only serve to muddy the boundary between two concepts that an AI is trying
    to learn. More data, in this case, won’t help and could actually decrease the
    accuracy of your existing models.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Big data slows everything down.** Building a model on a terabyte of data
    may take one thousand times longer than building a model on a gigabyte of data.
    Or it might take ten thousand times longer depending on the learning algorithm.Data
    science is all about rapid experimentation. Better to be nimble and imperfect.
    Fail fast. Fail forward.'

- en: '**Big data implementable models.**The end goal of any predictive model is to
    create a highly accurate model that can be deployed for the business. Sometimes
    using more obscure data from the dark recesses of the data lake may result in
    higher accuracy but the data used might be unreliable for actual deployment. Better
    to have a less accurate model that runs quickly and can be used by business.'

    assume that more accurate models are the goal. Start your project off with explicit
    ROI expectations based on both accuracy and speed of deployment.'

    is no reason to use all of it. If you have a good random sampling function, then
    you can accurately predict the accuracy of a model built with the entire database
    from small samples. Work rapidly with small samples then build the final model
    with the entire database.'

    IoT devices and other sources feel free to be smart about throwing some data away.
    Maybe throw a lot of data away. You can’t buy enough disk to store it all and
    it will gum up everything you are working on in later stages of your data science
    production line.'

- en: '**Look for more data sources.** Many of the recent breakthroughs in AI have
    come not from larger datasets but from the ability of the machine learning algorithms
    to tap into data that was previously unavailable to them. For example the large
    text, image, video and audio datasets that are commonplace today didn’t exist
    twenty years ago. Be constantly on the lookout for these new data opportunities.'

    your IT team will find itself less likely to be running errands for the data science
    team or having to kill runaway jobs that are soaking up all the cloud resources.
    Likewise your data scientists will be happier when they can spend more of their
    time building and testing models rather than moving data around or waiting for
    long training runs to complete.'

- en: '**Harder problems can be solved**. Building an AI model is not a magical experience
    that can only be executed by wizard-like researchers. It is much more about logistics
    than magic. It is similar to the story of an art teacher who told half his class
    that their grade would be based on the number of pieces of art they produced and
    the other half of the class would be graded on the quality of their best piece.
    Not surprisingly the quantity students produced the most works of art. Shockingly
    they also produced the highest quality items. Quantity sometimes begets quality.
    In our case, more models tried under the same resource constraints can mean a
    better best model.'

    advanced many companies' drive to become data-driven in their decision making
    processes. With the rise of AI and our ability to saturate even those powerful
    resources we now need to be more precise in what we need from our data. Building
    a culture of understanding of deep data and not just big data is what is needed
    now.
