- en: Over the past few years, as the buzz and apparently the demand for data scientists
    has continued to grow, people are eager to learn how to join, learn, advance and
    thrive in this seemingly lucrative profession. As someone who writes on analytics
    and occasionally teaches it, I am often asked - How do I become a data scientist?
  prefs: []

- en: Adding to the complexity of my answer is data science seems to be a multi-disciplinary
    field, while the university departments of statistics, computer science and management
    deal with data quite differently.

- en: But to cut the marketing created jargon aside, a data scientist is simply a
    person who can write code in a few languages (primarily R, Python and SQL) for
    data querying, manipulation , aggregation, and visualization using enough statistical
    knowledge to give back actionable insights to the business for making decisions.

- en: Since this rather practical definition of a data scientist is reinforced by
    the accompanying words on a job website for “data scientists” , ergo, here are
    some tools for learning the primary languages in data science- Python, R and SQL.
    A cheat sheet or reference card is a compilation of mostly used commands to help
    you learn that language’s syntax at a faster rate.

- en: The inclusion of SQL may lead to some to feel surprised (isn’t this the NoSQL
    era?) , but it is there for a logical reason. Both PIG and Hive Query Language
    are closely associated with SQL- the original Structured Query Language. In addition
    one can solely use the **sqldf** package within R (and the less widely used **python-sql**
    or **python-sqlparse** libraries for Pythonic data scientists) or even the Proc
    SQL commands within the old champion language SAS, and do most of what a data
    scientist is expected to do (at least in data munging).

- en: '![Python Cheat Sheets](../Images/fb4b6111cd2556304eb5ed3cc9c9794e.png) For
    Python, this is a rather partial list given the fact that Python, the most general
    purpose language within the data scientist quiver, can be used for many things.
    But for the data scientist, the packages of **numpy**, **scipy** , **pandas**
    and **scikit-learn** seem the most pertinent.'

    scientist? No.

- en: Accordingly we chose the appropriate cheat sheets for you. Note that this is
    a curated list of lists. If there is anything that can be assumed in the field
    of data science, it should be that the null hypothesis is that the data scientist
    is intelligent enough to make his own decisions based on data and it’s context.
    3 printouts is all it takes to speed up the aspiring data scientist’s journey.
