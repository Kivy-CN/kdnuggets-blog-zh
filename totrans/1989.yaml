    and processes. Halfway into 2023, it is better to think about what the next 18
    months would mean for data management platforms. I firmly believe that starting
    in 2024, enterprises stand at a critical juncture, realizing the indispensable
    need to harness data intelligently.

    fabrics and mesh have been hugely](https://www.rtinsights.com/data-fabric-vs-data-mesh-key-differences-and-similarities/)

    data from multiple sources into a unified view. This makes it easier for users
    to find and access the necessary data. Likewise, a Mesh gives domain experts more
    control over their data and can also help improve data quality and governance.

    Apart from improved data access, they make it easier for users to find and access
    the data as per their requirements. This leads to faster decision-making and insights.
    There’s also improved data quality by providing a single, unified view. Moreover,
    the centralized data access control and repository approach ensures improved governance
    and security.

    to schedule maintenance before the machine fails, which can prevent downtime and
    lost productivity. Why it matters is because the tech that is largely confined

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By masking sensitive data, enterprises can protect the privacy of their customers
    and employees, and they can also reduce their risk of data breaches. [Masking
    redacts sensitive data](https://www.k2view.com/what-is-data-masking) from datasets
    that are used for analytics and machine learning. This ensures that sensitive
    data is not used in ways that could violate GDPR, such as profiling or targeting
    individuals.
  prefs: []

- en: Data masking can be used to create pseudonymized datasets. Pseudonymized datasets
    are those in which personal data has been replaced with artificial identifiers.
    This makes it more difficult to identify individuals in the datasets, and it can
    help to protect their privacy. Even though significant data management tools offer
    masking expertise to a certain extent, I’ll recommend K2View for compliance qualifications
    as It provides comprehensive features for masking sensitive data, including redaction,
    tokenization, de-identification, pseudonymization, and data obfuscation. Their
    data masking solution can help businesses comply with various data privacy regulations,
    including GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA. The fabric solution is popular for its micro-database
    approach that contains a single entity's data, which has been masked according
    to the business's security and compliance requirements.
