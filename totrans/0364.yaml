    in the analytical aspect of my previous career. Incorporating IoT (Internet of
    Things) into business and utilizing various analytical techniques to collect and
    analyze data was highly valued in the past. I have started learning programming,
    statistics, and multiple data terminologies to pursue data science.

- en: I was trying to learn data science by watching random free courses on YouTube
    or Coursera, but it only left me feeling more confused. Even though I thought
    I understood what I was learning, I couldn't solve problems on my own.

    That's why I decided to take the career track from DataCamp. This program includes
    all the necessary courses to understand the basics of data science. The career
    track also has guided projects, interactive exercises, and assessment tests that
    have helped me build more confidence in my analytical abilities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must understand the mathematical basis behind models to maintain your professional
    reputation. I have experienced embarrassment in job interviews, meetings, and
    while creating documentation due to this. I vividly recall an interview where
    an expert asked me about the gradient descent equation, and I was unable to provide
    an answer. It was then that I realized I needed to revisit and strengthen my understanding
    of statistical fundamentals.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although I have worked on several projects and Kaggle competitions, I failed
    to document my progress and achievements. It took me a year to realize the importance
    of documenting both my project and journey, which can help me secure better job
    opportunities and build a stronger portfolio. In hindsight, I should have shared
    my journey on LinkedIn and Medium from the outset. Doing so would have allowed
    me to make new connections, expand my reach, enhance my professional portfolio,
    and facilitate collaboration.

    and code on GitHub. You can also write a blog post about it on Medium and share
    it with the LinkedIn data science group. This will help you get more exposure.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past, I applied for all data scientist, data analytics, or business intelligence
    jobs without researching what companies were seeking. I believed I could effortlessly
    transition into data science. However, I underestimated the extensive knowledge
    and skills required for the field. To succeed, it's crucial to remain humble,
    acknowledge your knowledge gaps, and commit to continuous learning.

    standard practices and acquire relevant skills. If you lack experience, consider
    seeking internships or contributing to reputable open-source projects.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Solution:** Once you''ve finished the essential course, focus on building
    a robust data science portfolio. Take the time to research job expectations and
    requirements, and continuously learn new tools and skills to enhance your resume.
    Avoid applying for jobs immediately and instead, strive to fully understand what
    potential employers are looking for in a candidate.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After discovering some tricks about machine learning, I began participating
    in competitions on Kaggle. I became addicted, even joining contests without prior
    knowledge of the topic. I convinced myself that I was learning new techniques
    from others, but in reality, I was just wasting my time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an advocate for learning machine learning through competitions, I must warn
    newbies that winning is difficult. While I came close and often placed among the
    top 1%, it did not add any significant value to my career. Instead, I should have
    focused on real-world projects or sought experience through internships or jobs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Solution:** Don''t fool yourself. Always keep your goals in mind. Instead
    of spreading yourself too thin by participating in too many competitions, consider
    focusing on a complex open-source project, writing on Medium, building your portfolio,
    and getting involved in community events.'

    I suggest that you explore other options that work for you. Don't let anyone discourage
    you. Keep trying, and you will eventually find a system that suits you and helps
    you achieve your dream job. Additionally, it's crucial to work on building your
    data science portfolio from the beginning by utilizing platforms such as Kaggle,
    GitHub, DagsHub, and Deepnote.
