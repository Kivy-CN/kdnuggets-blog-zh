- en: As the field of Artificial Intelligence is growing and evolving, we have seen
    the rise of powerful tools like GPT, ChatGPT, Bard, etc. Programmers are using
    these tools to streamline their workflows and optimize their codebase. It has
    enabled them to focus more on building the program's core logic and less on the
    more mundane and repetitive tasks. However, programmers are experiencing the issue
    of copy-pasting their code into these models, getting the recommendations, and
    then updating their codebase. This procedure becomes tiresome for the people who
    do it frequently.

- en: Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem now. Let me introduce you to
    Promptr, an open-source command line-based tool that allows programmers to automate
    their codebase without leaving their editor. Sounds cool! Right? If you are interested
    to know more about how this tool works, what it offers, and how to set it up?
    Please sit back and relax while I explain it to you.

    to your codebase a lot easier. You can refactor your code, implement the classes
    to pass the test, experiment with LLMs, perform debugging and troubleshooting,
    etc all with just a single line of code. As per its  official documentation:'

    depending on your use case. Now, you might be wondering how it all happens under
    the hood. So, let's explore that.

    you need to write a prompt with clear instructions as if you are explaining the
    task to an inexperienced co-worker. After that, specify the context that you will
    send along with your prompt to GPT. Please note that prompt is your instruction
    to GPT while context refers to the files that GPT must know to perform the codebase
    operations. For instance,

    your prompt to GPT. Promptr will send it to GPT and wait for the response as it
    may take some time. Then the response generated by the GPT is first parsed by
    Promptr after which the suggested changes are applied to your file system. And
    that’s it! Simple yet a very useful tool.

    maintain their text files, this technology is still in its early stages and has
    some cons. For example, there is a potential for data loss if deleting files is
    recommended by GPT hence it is advised to commit to your important work before
    using it. Similarly, some people have expressed their concern about the per-token
    cost of using the OpenAI API. Nonetheless, I wonder how far is it when we can
    develop software that can self-repair. If you want to experiment with it, here
    is the link to the official GitHub repository - [Promptr](https://github.com/ferrislucas/promptr).
