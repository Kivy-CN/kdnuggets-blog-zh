  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to perform a task in
    an environment by taking an action and maximizing the cumulative rewards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It enjoys applications in multiple domains e.g. bid optimization to display
    ad impressions in real-time, self-driving cars, industrial automation including
    cooling of data-centers, stock price prediction, etc. You can read more about
    its real-world applications [here](https://neptune.ai/blog/reinforcement-learning-applications).

    general intelligence](https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/09/deepmind-says-reinforcement-learning-is-enough-to-reach-general-ai/).
    In the absence of an absolute [‘right’ answer](https://www.cdotrends.com/story/15555/why-reinforcement-learning-matters-business),
    learning RL is your best bet to design AI solutions.

    then you should check this tutorial to understand the basics, various terminologies,
    and key concepts in deep learning. It explains how neural networks learn, what
    are the various activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers. It also
    gives an overview of neural network architectures and concludes with a 5-step
    framework to build a neural network.
