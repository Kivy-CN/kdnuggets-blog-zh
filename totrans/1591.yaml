    inspired me was “Strategy Safari” by *Henry Mintzberg, Bruce Ahlstrand, and Joseph
    Lampel*.  Strategic Safari, describes different perspectives on strategy as summarised
    in the attached matrix.

    perspectives on strategy.There is no doubt that works of other greats in the field
    like Peter Drucker and Michael Porter  did shape my thinking process and my perspectives
    on strategic management. However what made this book on top of my favourite list
    is the different angles through which the field of strategic management was looked
    at by the authors. The title of this post is derived by drawing inspiration from
    Mintzberg’s seminal work. In this post, I am attempting to take you on a safari
    through the data science strategy formulation process.

- en: When formulating a data science strategy, a pertinent question one can ask is
    this. With tremendous strides data science is making in influencing business outcomes,
    should data science strategy lead organisation strategy or like any other functional
    strategy, should it be aligned to Organisational strategies ? Well, in my opinion,
    like any other functional strategy, data science strategy should also be aligned
    to organisational strategy. Data science domain would have no meaning if it is
    not used to support the organisation in meeting its overall objectives. And for
    this very reason I strongly believe that data science strategy has to be derived
    out of organisation strategy. So the next question is how do we define a data
    science strategy which is aligned to organisation strategy ? To answer that question
    let us decipher the strategic alignment framework.

    and actions are aligned to the planned organisational objectives. Data science
    has become a very critical competency an organisation have to build, to have an
    edge in this digitally connected era. However it is equally important that the
    output from a data science engagement i.e predictions,recommendations, inferential
    studies et al fits well into the overall scheme of strategic objectives an organisation
    wishes to pursue. This can be achieved by traversing the processes of the alignment
    framework. Figure 2 is the depiction of data science strategic alignment framework.

    of an insurance company. Let us take the case of  a single function within the
    value chain i.e ‘Customer Management’.

- en: The trail for analysis for the customer management function is as depicted in
    figure 3 above. To ensure that data science strategy is aligned to organisational
    goals, the first step of the process is to identify Key Performance Indicators
    ( KPI’s )  for each function within the value chain. For the function ‘customer
    management’ which we are analysing, one critical KPI which has substantial impact
    on the top line and bottom line is *“Improving customer retention rate”*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having identified a critical performance indicator, alignment to it would entail
    deriving data science use cases which will help in achievement of this performance
    indicator . For customer management function a  use case which will help in improving
    customer retention rate would be to predict probability of premium renewal. The
    output from this use case can be used for targeted campaigns towards customers
    who have low probability of renewing premiums, there by enabling achievement of
    the KPI.  In addition to use cases which are directly related to the KPI we should
    also derive related use cases which will enable the process of achieving that
    KPI. For example having known which customer to be targeted, it would also be
    valuable to know specifics of how to target them,like predicting right time and
    channel to reach out to target customers or predicting right price point for giving
    them specific offers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a similar fashion, we have to look across all the functions,critical metrics
    within each function and derive all primary and related predictive use cases.
    These use cases can be formed into an interconnected web called Strategic Alignment
    Map ( SAM). Figure 4 below  is a representative SAM depicting the business value
    chain,its critical functions, interconnected web of use cases and its corresponding
    category ( Natural Language Processing, Inferential , Machine Learning/Deep Learning,
    Other AI etc). A comprehensive SAM would form the blue print for aligning data
    science projects to organisational strategy and also in indicating inter dependencies
    between different use cases / models. In addition, it will also be an aid to get
    a view on various data science competencies which are required to add value to
    an organisation.

    decipher the operational aspects of data science strategy.

- en: Once we have an interconnected web of use cases critical for the organisation,
    the next task would be in getting data acquisition and integration strategies
    aligned to the overall strategy. To align data acquisition strategies to overall
    strategy we first have to know what kind of data points are required for implementing
    the use cases depicted in the SAM and also the characteristics of the data points
    like formats, velocity, frequency, data systems which generate them etc. A good
    approach to derive those details is to look at each use case, identify business
    factors influencing  each of them and then working our way downwards.
  prefs: []

    a bearing on the renewal rate are

    effectiveness etc
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A comprehensive list of  factors like the above have to be identified through
    close discussions with business/domain teams. Having identified various factors
    affecting each use case the next task is to identify data points related to each
    factor. Some of the major data points related to factors influencing renewal rate
    is depicted in figure 5 below.

- en: The requirement for data points related to each factor governs data sourcing
    and integration strategies. From the various data points depicted above we can
    see that data requirements can be from within the organisation and also from external
    sources. For example, data points related to competition in all probability will
    have to be acquired from external sources. Other data points predominantly can
    be acquired from various systems within the organisation.

    related to each use case. Some of the data types related to the identified data

- en: Having seen the data science strategic alignment framework in action one can
    not help but wonder if we can draw parallels from the framework to some of the
    perspectives of Mintzberg’s “Strategy Safari”. The process steps encapsulated
    within this framework have elements of the Learning, Cognitive and Planning Schools
    of strategy formulation. However at the end of the day this framework, like any
    other framework, is aimed at structuring one’s though process towards achievement
    of certain objectives. The objective it aims to accomplish is to ensure that your
    data science efforts are aligned to overall Organisational goals and strategies.
