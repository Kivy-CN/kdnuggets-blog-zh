- en: Interviews are designed to weed out candidates that aren’t qualified to do a
    job.  However, they’re not perfect and there are aspects of interviews that are
    not representative of the real-life job.  Some people take a cynical approach
    and use this fact as an excuse when they get rejected.  They say things like,
    “Why would they ask me that?  Anyone could just look that up!”  Although that
    may be true, ranting doesn’t get you a job.  For a company it makes more sense
    to reject good people than to hire a bad one.  As Data Scientists we should know
    all about the tradeoffs of false positive vs true positive rates!  In this article
    I’ll give you some tips and resources for improving your interviewing skills so
    that you’re less likely to get rejected for a bad reason.

- en: '**Have the stories prepared and rehearsed**.  You should expect questions that
    are meant to understand your attitude/character and have already thought out several
    examples of your past that demonstrate desirable traits.  For instance, Amazon
    has a list of [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) that
    they interview against.  Find something like this and spend a couple hours thinking
    through all the great stuff you’ve done and write out **concise** answers to these
    questions.  The skill is being able to tell a short anecdote that has just enough
    details to set up the narrative and establish you as being the person doing the
    good thing they asked about.  They’ll ask clarifying questions if they want to,
    but avoid rambling and giving too much information.  Being a bore will not help!'

    think on your feet to get answers while people are looking at you and the clock
    is ticking.  Even questions you would normally think are easy seem hard in this
    environment.  Minimize this surprise as much as possible by learning what to expect
    in each interview and preparing for all the things you know are coming.  [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/) has
    interview reviews from people that have been through it, so don’t take the interview
    until you’ve done some research and at least read what’s out there.  Always ask
    the recruiter what you can expect and their advice for preparing.'

    If you’re a Data Scientist, SQL questions are very common.  Find example questions
    from places like [JitBits](https://www.jitbit.com/news/181-jitbits-sql-interview-questions/) or [ProgrammerInterview](http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/database-sql/practice-interview-question-1-continued/) and
    actually work through them.  When you make mistakes, write down what you missed
    so you know to spend more time on that topic.'

- en: '**Establish and practice your problem solving framework**.  After doing many
    technical interviews I have learned that the same framework can be applied to
    most questions and in doing so it gives me clarity of thought and good momentum. 
    I’ll dedicate a whole post to articulating the framework I use, but you’ll develop
    your own by working through many of these problems.'

    will give you a refresher on core principles as well as examples to test yourself. 
    You should expect probability and statistics questions, so don’t allow yourself
    to waste time trying to remember Bayes’ Theorem when you can prepare for it.'

- en: '**Know the common technical concepts**.  If you’re in Data Science, you need
    to understand bias/variance.  You need to know ways of detecting and handling
    an overfit model.  You need to know strategies for dealing with classification
    problems when the classes are highly imbalanced.  You need to know the pros and
    cons of the various model structures.  You need to also understand the basics
    of how the algorithms work; what is random about random forests and what is meant
    by gradient boosting?  Treat the technical interview as an oral, comprehensive
    final exam.  Learn the core principles of the major concepts.'

- en: '**Know the company**.  Spend time thinking about the products of the company,
    how your job impacts the core of the business, and a few ideas of how you would
    do your job to solve an important problem.  I remember being interviewed for a
    Pricing Analytics job and the interviewer asking me: How would you determine a
    price for this product?  I didn’t have a good answer and that’s unacceptable. 
    You should spend time thinking deeply about the problems the role would likely
    work on and be able to talk about it with some nuance.  I should have spent time
    thinking about how pricing is normally set in that domain, thought through a few
    approaches, and researched their engineering blog to try to understand how they
    currently do it.  There’s a tremendous amount of information on the web that will
    help, you just need to be proactive in finding and absorbing it.'

- en: '**Recognize that being technically qualified is only part of it**.  People
    will also give their feedback based on if they liked you or not.  Project a good
    mood, be flattering to them and their company, demonstrate your excitement with
    the role and your humility in the opportunity.  Someone is more likely to forgive a
    small technical deficiency of a person they like than rude behavior of a technically
    brilliant person.  This is also true of your communications with the recruiter. 
    Be overly polite, send follow up thank you’s and express your gratitude at every
    opportunity (which should be genuine!).'

    The most important part is to not give up even when it feels like you’re trapped
    and have no idea how to proceed.  Do not allow yourself to get outwardly frustrated
    or dismissive.  In those moments, you should say out loud what you’re struggling
    with and the problem you’ve discovered.  If your solution isn’t working, explain
    why and try to figure out what part of it is leading to the failure.  Often times
    they will give a gentle hint.  The important part is to stay curious and talk
    it out.  I’ve had several experiences where I left feeling embarrassed and sure
    that I bombed the interview only to hear feedback later that they thought I did
    well and wanted me to proceed to the next round.  You just never know what they’re
    thinking, so stay positive!

- en: Last, truly **internalize the idea that a job rejection is not a judgment on
    your talent**.  The odds are that you will be rejected ... several times.  But
    that’s OK, because this is a big world and we know its a numbers game.  Not everyone
    is a great fit for every job and team, even if they are technically excellent. 
    Sometimes you get rejected because it wasn’t a great fit, other times because
    you didn’t perform well in an interview (even though you’d be great for the job)
    and other times for reasons you’ll never understand.  When you are rejected, allow
    yourself time to absorb any negative emotions and then reach out to both thank
    them and get feedback on how you could improve.
