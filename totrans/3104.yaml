- en: We're back. Again. The "Overlook..." posts have been dormant for a few months,
    but fret not, here's another installment. We continue on with the modest quest
    of bringing formidable, lesser-known machine learning projects to a few additional
    sets of eyes.

- en: This outing is made up exclusively of Python projects, not by intention design,
    but no doubt influenced by my own biases. While previous iterations have included
    projects in all sorts of lnauges (R, Go, C++, Scala, Java, etc.), I promise an
    all R version sometime soon, and will employ some outside assistance when it comes
    to evaluating those projects (I'm admittedly not very well tuned into the R ecosystem).

    extend the scikit-learn API to allow human steering of the model selection process.
    In a nutshell, Yellowbrick combines scikit-learn with matplotlib in the best tradition
    of the scikit-learn documentation, but to produce visualizations for your models!
