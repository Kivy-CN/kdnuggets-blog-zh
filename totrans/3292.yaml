    visualizations, exposing APIs to some programming languages (Python among them).
    There is a number of robust, out-of-box graphics on the plot.ly website. In order
    to use Plotly, you will need to set up your API key. The graphics will be processed
    server side and will be posted on the internet, but there is a way to avoid it.

- en: Scikits are additional packages of SciPy Stack designed for specific functionalities
    like image processing and machine learning facilitation. In the regard of the
    latter, one of the most prominent of these packages is scikit-learn. The package
    is built on the top of SciPy and makes heavy use of its math operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scikit-learn exposes a concise and consistent interface to the common machine
    learning algorithms, making it simple to bring ML into production systems. The
    library combines quality code and good documentation, ease of use and high performance
    and is de-facto industry standard for machine learning with Python.

- en: In the regard of Deep Learning, one of the most prominent and convenient libraries
    for Python in this field is Keras, which can function either on top of TensorFlow
    or Theano. Let’s reveal some details about all of them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, let’s talk about Theano.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Theano is a Python package that defines multi-dimensional arrays similar to
    NumPy, along with math operations and expressions. The library is compiled, making
    it run efficiently on all architectures. Originally developed by the Machine Learning
    group of Université de Montréal, it is primarily used for the needs of Machine
    Learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The important thing to note is that Theano tightly integrates with NumPy on
    low-level of its operations. The library also optimizes the use of GPU and CPU,
    making the performance of data-intensive computation even faster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Efficiency and stability tweaks allow for much more precise results with even
    very small values, for example, computation of log(1+x) will give cognizant results
    for even smallest values of x.

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Coming from developers at Google, it is an open-source library of data flow
    graphs computations, which are sharpened for Machine Learning. It was designed
    to meet the high-demand requirements of Google environment for training Neural
    Networks and is a successor of DistBelief, a Machine Learning system, based on
    Neural Networks. However, TensorFlow isn’t strictly for scientific use in border’s
    of Google — it is general enough to use it in a variety of real-world application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key feature of TensorFlow is their multi-layered nodes system that enables
    quick training of artificial neural networks on large datasets. This powers Google’s
    voice recognition and object identification from pictures.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And finally, let’s look at the Keras. It is an open-source library for building
    Neural Networks at a high-level of the interface, and it is written in Python.
    It is minimalistic and straightforward with high-level of extensibility. It uses
    Theano or TensorFlow as its backends, but Microsoft makes its efforts now to integrate
    CNTK (Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit) as a new back-end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The minimalistic approach in design aimed at fast and easy experimentation through
    the building of compact systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keras is really eased to get started with and keep going with quick prototyping.
    It is written in pure Python and high-level in its nature. It is highly modular
    and extendable. Notwithstanding its ease, simplicity, and high-level orientation,
    Keras is still deep and powerful enough for serious modeling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The general idea of Keras is based on layers, and everything else is built around
    them. Data is prepared in tensors, the first layer is responsible for input of
    tensors, the last layer is responsible for output, and the model is built in between.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The name of this suite of libraries stands for Natural Language Toolkit and,
    as the name implies, it used for common tasks of symbolic and statistical Natural
    Language Processing. NLTK was intended to facilitate teaching and research of
    NLP and the related fields (Linguistics, Cognitive Science Artificial Intelligence,
    etc.) and it is being used with a focus on this today.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The functionality of NLTK allows a lot of operations such as text tagging, classification,
    and tokenizing, name entities identification, building corpus tree that reveals
    inter and intra-sentence dependencies, stemming, semantic reasoning. All of the
    building blocks allow for building complex research systems for different tasks,
    for example, sentiment analytics, automatic summarization.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is an open-source library for Python that implements tools for work with
    vector space modeling and topic modeling. The library designed to be efficient
    with large texts, not only in-memory processing is possible. The efficiency is
    achieved by the using of NumPy data structures and SciPy operations extensively.
    It is both efficient and easy to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gensim is intended for use with raw and unstructured digital texts. Gensim implements
    algorithms such as hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP), latent semantic analysis
    (LSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), as well as tf-idf, random projections,
    word2vec and document2vec facilitate examination of texts for recurring patterns
    of words in the set of documents (often referred as a corpus). All of the algorithms
    are unsupervised — no need for any arguments, the only input is corpus.

    for retrieval of the structured data, such as contact info or URLs, from the web.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is open-source and written in Python. It was originally designed strictly
    for scraping, as its name indicate, but it has evolved in the full-fledged framework
    with the ability to gather data from APIs and act as general-purpose crawlers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The library follows famous Don’t Repeat Yourself in the interface design — it
    prompts its users to write the general, universal code that is going to be reusable,
    thus making building and scaling large crawlers.
  prefs: []
