    technology set to make industries (across sectors and regions) customer and revenue

    projects](https://appinventiv.com/blog/machine-learning-app-development/), there’s
    an almost equal rise in the number of project failures. The increasing failure
    rate of machine learning projects is in many ways keeping new businesses with
    brilliant AI ideas away from implementing them.

    reasons behind machine learning projects’ failure. We are hopeful that the information
    will help you plan a better implementation, one that carries fewer chances of
    failure in all three stages of ML execution: pre-project, during the project,
    and post-project.'

    for a massive amount of data for a machine learning project’s success. For a [successful
    machine learning project](/2015/12/top-10-machine-learning-github.html), businesses
    need to have access to clean data - data which is relevant, useful, free of inaccuracy,
    and accessible.

    must be readily available for both short tasks and large scale training in one
    place - a data warehouse, data lake, or some data platform.

- en: On the advice of data scientists, organizations tend to add models that are
    designed to foster innovation without thinking of their alignment with their present
    ‘non-digital’ culture and legacy systems. So while those solutions run well in
    the market, when incorporated with the existing system, there is little to zero
    success rate in terms of ease of adoption.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution to this lies in bringing the teams that will be working on the
    machine learning project and the one that manages the legacy system together.
    Following this, a milestone-wise deployment of the project should be planned for
    aiding easy adoption with a friction-less migration.

    are a number of engineers completing courses and tagging themselves as data scientists,
    the ones who are truly skilled to see through a complex ML project are extremely
    limited in number. According to a [2020 State of Enterprise Machine Learning report](https://info.algorithmia.com/2020?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=IC-1912-2020-State-of-ML),
    while the demand for Machine Learning experts is on a constant rise, there is
    a sharp shortage in terms of supply to fill the role.

    a machine learning project. While they back the project seeing the fame that surrounds
    it, they pay less attention to ensuring data accessibility, accuracy, funds and

    everyone on board](https://tdan.com/how-to-convince-stakeholders-that-data-governance-is-necessary/26933)
    — especially the board members — since even a hint of doubt in them can lead to
    a lot of insecurity among the teams, something that guarantees project failure
    even before it sets off the ground.

    a competitive edge.
  id: totrans-34

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution to addressing these challenges more often than not lies with partnering
    with a skilled machine learning solution provider company that understands both
    business and technical implications of applying a new-gen technology in a non-digital
    organization. They can help you in not just creating a work plan of how to integrate
    machine learning projects but also with adopting the new system in the most optimal
    way.
