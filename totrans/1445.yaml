    learning** — I didn’t care much what the data was about, and how it was gathered
    and prepared. Due to this attitude, I was a bit shocked and disappointed when
    the semester started.

    machine learning engineers this probably won’t apply to you, because you’ll be
    doing machine learning for the most of the day. But if that isn’t the case, you’ll
    spend only about 15% of the time doing machine learning.
