- en: One type of advanced technology, computer vision (CV), is becoming more ubiquitous
    across different sectors of the economy. A primary benefit of CV is that it can
    be applied in many ways — the possibilities are seemingly endless.

- en: CV is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows machines to “see”
    the world around them. Devices integrated with computer vision can analyze visual
    information and make decisions based on it or understand their surrounding environment
    and situations. Deep learning and machine learning algorithms are both used to
    power CV.

- en: The world generates tremendous amounts of data, causing CV to grow exponentially.
    Much of the information analyzed by CV is images and videos, but it also includes
    data from other sources, including infrared and thermal sensors. Because CV is
    a component of AI, the overall goal is to mimic human behavior as efficiently
    as possible.

- en: CV is a revolutionary technology, as machines can replicate parts of the human
    vision system, which is complex in and of itself. In fact, CV surpassed people’s
    abilities to detect and label objects — today’s systems [have reached 99% accuracy](https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-computer-vision-heres-a-look-why-it-s-so-awesome-e8a58dfb641e)
    in reacting to visual inputs.

- en: Simply put, CV is all about pattern recognition. Computers can be trained by
    feeding them thousands, if not millions, of images that have been labeled. Researchers
    then subject computers to various software techniques that allow them to hunt
    down patterns.

- en: The computer analyzes colors, shapes, distances between objects, and various
    other elements until it profiles these images. In theory, once a computer is trained,
    it can use its experience when provided with different pictures to identify all
    types of objects.

    efficiency, and operations. Various components work together to make machine vision
    systems work properly, such as sensors, cameras, and lighting. For example, [popular
    lighting choices for machine vision systems](https://www.advancedillumination.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/A-Practical-Guide-to-Machine-Vision-Lighting-v.-4-Generic.pdf)
    include fluorescents, LEDs, quartz halogen, and metal halide (mercury).
