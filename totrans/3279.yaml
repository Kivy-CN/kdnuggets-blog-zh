- en: Virtually every Fortune Global 500 company is on the path to digital transformation,
    but each is in a different phase and many need to clear the final hurdles to truly
    unlock its true potential. The journey toward transformation is no doubt difficult,
    and large firms will sometimes need to tolerate high failure rates to push through.
    There is hope, however.

    they lack enterprise-wide intelligence and a culture of teamwork to harmonize
    their efforts. In short, they lack a “digital brain,” the nexus for continuous,
    automated learning from data across all business units, departments, product lines
    and services, that gives the organization higher cognition. That’s why every company
    needs a digital brain to make their digital transformation come alive, else they
    risk incremental, short-sighted and superficial change.

    to new cells that carry out different functions, companies work toward digital
    transformation in a very stepwise or piecemeal approach. This is absolutely necessary,
    as change starts small and grows. The creation of any digital brain begins with
    the formation of microservices, where a company’s application architecture is
    organized as a loose bundle of services that continuously learn and work to predict
    specific outcomes.

    open source software and cloud technologies to build great digital products and
    a world-class developer experience. These microservices have opened up new revenue
    streams and innovative financial services because they have a 360-degree view
    of their customers.

- en: The microservices model and the rise of the Internet of Things has swiftly moved
    intelligence toward the edge, where tiny sensors and lightweight devices that
    are rapidly approaching the computational power equivalent to a smartphone. This
    decentralization of intelligence is amplified by open source software movement,
    which has catalyzed a maker culture. It’s participatory, and allows companies
    to be makers of software, not just consumers of software. Open source also drives
    monetization – which we’ve seen at Google, Amazon, Apple, and beyond.

- en: From an enterprise-wide perspective, however, this phenomenon where intelligence
    exists at the edge can create its own hazards of fragmentation and blind spots
    for the company. What has made companies like Google and Amazon so successful
    is their ability to connect the dots between their various different micro-businesses
    in order to exploit synergies. This is a critical piece, and most often where
    companies fall short. With a digital brain, organizations are armed with greater
    self-awareness and interdisciplinary thinking to drive radically new business
    models.

    the trap of viewing their data as static assets or “treasure troves” that exist
    in various units of the business. Enterprises need to move toward thinking about
    harnessing real-time streaming data that continuously circulates throughout the
    entire organization, not just silos. This means looking at what the different
    use cases for streaming data, building the right models, and finding how you can
    monetize them in a totally different vertical.

    models around salaries in certain geographic areas, could be used for real estate
    purposes. In effect, with the right data and models, a payroll company could become
    a real estate company, a finance company, and an insurance company. With a digital
    brain, vertical companies can become horizontal ones.

- en: It comes as no surprise that data is is crucial to the health of the digital
    brain, and a lack of it could stifle transformation. That’s why companies may
    choose to create alliances with others for the purpose of sharing data and/or
    models, with the end goal of building innovative applications that neither could
    create on their own. Consider the payroll company, which could partner with an
    insurance company for the purpose of building applications that predict when a
    person will be able to buy a home and offer them the right policy.

- en: Companies today are pursuing digital transformation in large part because they
    fear the consequences of not doing it. What the end-goal of transformation is
    many companies have not yet articulated. A digital brain is the culmination of
    that transformation, as it gives the company a higher purpose and business model
    to monetize. The process of building a brain begins with microservices, wherein
    the business reinvents itself as many smaller business units that can leverage
    data from the edge thanks to the rise of IoT and cloud computing. But only when
    these units are coordinated can system-wide change occur, and that requires data
    and models–the lifeblood of continuous learning across verticals.
