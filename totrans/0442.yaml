    your ability to tell your story. A curated selection of your projects is the best
    way to showcase your expertise and share your experience.

- en: I personally had challenges consolidating my projects and also figuring out
    the best way to share my passion. Data science and engineering projects are usually
    vague and can be difficult to present which in my case, comes in two flavors,
    code and content. I have my source codes sitting on my Github page and my write-ups
    on my medium or somewhere on the web .

    every section.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I designed this section imagining that I’m giving someone an elevator pitch
    of who I am and what I do. I added the GIF as a representation of myself and to
    give an interactive feeling. *(I guess I could have just added a GIF of myself
    but at this point, my confidence level is not there yet!)*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As for the background, initially it was white. I usually use minimal white colors
    for almost all my visuals because of its safe-feel-that-match-with anything kind
    of look. But then, I can’t be a creature of habit all the time so I decided to
    be adventurous and go all in with pastel gradients.

- en: After that quick introduction, there are three things a visitor would do as
    a next step. Similar to the options you are given in the real world — when you
    meet someone, you either aggressively give them your contact or business card
    which represents the **Send a Mail** button (*I know I said it’s aggressive but
    it’s totally fine to send me one anyway, I love reading emails!*), you can start
    jumping right to it and dig for more details by looking at the **resume** or carry
    on with the get to know conversation and get a feel of the person by scrolling
    down to the portfolio more.

- en: Following up to that mini elevator pitch about myself and my interests, I designed
    this section to share more about what I’ve done. Within this section I categorized
    my projects. The very first one is the Featured category, this is for me to select
    and feature my favorite work. The other categories are related to coding, articles
    I wrote and my data visualizations.
  prefs: []

    to be shared which explains why I have limited projects listed* **for now.** *I’m
    currently trying to find time to do more personal research work.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I included purple tags to give a quick idea of what the projects are about.
    I’ve also added Learn more links at the bottom, and if you’ve noticed all of which
    opens a new tab when clicked. I’m very particular about this external tab because
    I want the viewer to keep the portfolio in the other tab so they can easily switch
    back to my page and explore the portfolio more after learning about a specific
    project.

- en: I started this section with a one liner that sums up the type of companies I’ve
    worked with. My goal is to highlight my previous roles and to redirect the viewer
    to download my resume. I don’t want to overwhelm them with information which is
    why I skipped the JD bullet points.

- en: You might wonder — why put this at the bottom instead of highlighting more about
    myself at the very beginning? Well, in real life I noticed a pattern with how
    people communicate and interact at networking events. *(I should put some flashy
    behavioral stats here, but I don’t have it so yes this is based on my personal
    experience* ????*).* First, you ask about work, what they do and then after a
    bit of conversation exchange eventually you get more personal, which is why I
    placed this section at the bottom part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how did I decide on what personal things to share? This was actually one
    of the most difficult sections to write because I’m not used to sharing things
    about me and I feel like the activities I do outside of work aren't all **that**
    unique. I included the most basic things one would ask, including where I’m based
    at and what my hobbies are. I also added a cheeky photo which may be a bit unprofessional
    compared to the other sections but it gives the page more character *(and I also
    wanted to show my fun side)*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wrote down my skills and my most used tools to give an idea of what my everyday
    work looks like. This was also challenging because I didn’t want to come off as
    a Kat of All Trades that can do a bit of everything from data engineering to full
    on data analysis, but I think these are some of the skills and tools that a strong
    Data Scientist should have to be more efficient and productive with work — one
    must know how to get down and dirty with data. I’m also a work in progress but
    I’m always trying to learn new things.

    only my public accounts (and I have different email address for more private accounts).

- en: I’m not big on web development and I wish I have more time to work on how I
    can really improve my portfolio — but again web design is not my niche and my
    main goal is to just showcase my work. I started using **Webflow** to save time
    on development and I just added my own chunks of CSS and Javascript codes for
    extra features. Webflow also made it easier for me to make the website device
    responsive. There’s some costs associated with it and it requires a wee bit of
    UI / UX development knowledge, however there are other options like Square Space
    or Wix that might be more friendly for users who have no coding or development
    experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overall for me, it took a weekend to build the website with the content and
    sketch already in place. I have yet to optimize individual elements of my portfolio
    to improve loading speed especially on mobile. I still have to add more projects
    into it or perhaps pick better ones to feature — but overall I’m happy with what
    I’ve built so far.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s no such thing as right or wrong way in building a portfolio, one piece
    of advice is to start thinking about how you want to tell your story and then
    start creating a framework from there.
