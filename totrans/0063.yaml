    fanfare](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/25/prompt-engineers-techs-next-big-job/),

    publicly available. Suddenly, the average Joe realized the importance of prompts
    and the notion of GIGO—garbage in, garbage out. If you write a sloppy prompt without
    any details, the LLM will have free reign over the output. It was simple at first,
    but users soon realized the model’s true capabilities.

    hyperbole. Media narratives have oscillated between extolling its virtues and
    decrying its vices, often amplifying successes while downplaying its limitations.
    This dichotomy has sown confusion and inflated expectations, leading people to
    believe it’s either magic or completely worthless, and nothing in between.

    of the transient nature of technological trends. Technologies that once promised
    to revolutionize the world, from the metaverse to foldable phones, have often
    seen their luster fade as reality failed to meet the lofty expectations set by
    early hype. This pattern of inflated enthusiasm followed by disillusionment casts
    a shadow of doubt over the long-term viability of prompt engineering.
