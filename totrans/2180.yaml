  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    quantitative tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This algorithm is used to predict a continuous outcome (y) using one or more
    independent variables (X).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    prices based on their size.

    to predict the house price, which is the independent variable.

    given one or more independent variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can be used to predict whether a given message should be classified as legitimate

- en: Notice that unlike linear regression which represents a straight line, logistic
    regression is modeled as an S-shape curve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As indicated in the curve above, as the number of negative keywords increases,
    so does the probability of the message being classified as spam.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The x-axis of this curve represents the number of negative keywords, and the
    y-axis shows the probability of the email being spam.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, in logistic regression, a probability of 0.5 or greater indicates
    a positive outcome — in this context, it means that the message is spam.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conversely, a probability of less than 0.5 indicates a negative outcome, meaning
    the message is not spam.

- en: Decision trees are a popular machine learning model used for both classification
    and regression tasks.
  prefs: []

    structure to model this data.
  prefs: []

    specific parameters until a final decision is made.

    the decision is no and there are no more splits.

    they should refrain from doing so.
  prefs:

    process down into simple, manageable questions.

    outcome, and the intuition behind the process would remain the same.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The random forest model combines the predictions made by multiple decision trees
    and returns a single output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intuitively, this model should perform better than a single decision tree because
    it leverages the capabilities of multiple predictive models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is done with the help of a technique known as bagging, or bootstrap aggregation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here’s how bagging works:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A statistical technique called bootstrap is used to sample the dataset multiple
    times with replacement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, a decision tree is trained on each sample dataset. The output of all the
    trees are finally combined to render a single prediction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the case of a regression problem, the final output is generated by averaging
    the predictions made by each decision tree. For classification problems, a majority
    class prediction is made.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So far, all the machine learning models we’ve discussed fall under the umbrella
    of a method called supervised learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Supervised learning is a technique that uses a labeled dataset to train algorithms
    to predict an outcome.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, unsupervised learning is a technique that doesn’t deal with labeled
    data. Instead, it identifies patterns in data without being trained on what specific
    outcomes to look for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning model that essentially ingests
    unlabeled data and assigns each data point to a cluster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    each represented by a different color. These clusters are grouped based on their
    proximity to the centroid, denoted by a red X-mark.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simply put, all data points within Cluster 1 share similar characteristics,
    which is why they are grouped together. The same principle applies to Clusters
    2 and 3.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When building a K-Means clustering model, you must explicitly specify the number
    of clusters you’d like to generate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can be accomplished using a technique called the elbow method, which simply
    plots the model’s error scores with various cluster values on a line chart. Then,
    you choose the inflection point of the curve, or its “elbow” as the optimal number
    of clusters.
