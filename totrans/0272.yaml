    problems for us, without requiring explicit programming instructions. This is
    critical for two reasons. The first is that we likely wouldn’t be able, or at
    least know how to write the programs required to model and solve many problems
    that AI techniques are able to solve. Second, even if we did know how to write
    the programs, they would be inordinately complex and nearly impossible to get

    the case where once an AI application has become somewhat mainstream, it’s no
    longer considered by many as AI. It happens because people’s tendency is to no
    longer think of the solution as involving real intelligence, and only being a
    application of normal computing.

    is actually a *weighted combination* of potentially many input signals, and the
    weighting of each input means that that input can have a different influence on
    any subsequent calculations, and ultimately on the final output of the entire
    network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    inputs, which means that the combined weighted input signal is transformed mathematically
    prior to evaluating if the *activation threshold* has been exceeded. This combination
    of weighted input signals and the functions applied are typically either linear
    or nonlinear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the most important, as well as ingestion of gases (breathing), liquids (drinking),
    and solids (eating) for example. A single neuron may receive hundreds of thousands
    of input signals at once that undergo the summation process to determine if the
    message gets passed along, and ultimately causes the brain to instruct actions,
    memory recollection, and so on.

    instructions given to our muscles, organs, and body are the result of these neural
    networks in action. In addition, the brain’s neural networks continuously change
    and update themselves in many ways, including modifications to the amount of weighting
    applied between neurons. This happens as a direct result of learning and experience.

    through neurons and layers is a form of *distributed representation*, as contrasted

    Feature extraction is when an algorithm is able to automatically derive or construct
    meaningful features of the data to be used for further learning, generalization,
    and understanding. The burden is traditionally on the data scientist or programmer
    to carry out the feature extraction process in most other machine learning approaches,
    along with feature selection and engineering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    well, which is reducing the amount of input features and data required to generate
    meaningful results. This has many benefits, which include simplification, computational
    and memory power reduction, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More generally, deep learning falls under the group of techniques known as *feature
    learning* or *representation learning*. As discussed so far, feature extraction
    is used to ‘learn’ which features to focus on and use in machine learning solutions.
    The machine learning algorithms themselves ‘learn’ the optimal parameters to create
    the best performing model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    learn for a specific task using a well-suited set of features, and also learn
    the features themselves. In other words, these algorithms *learn how to learn*!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to be one of the most cutting-edge machine learning and AI techniques at the time
    of this writing. The associated algorithms are often used for *supervised*, *unsupervised*,
    and *semi-supervised* learning problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For neural network-based deep learning models, the number of layers are greater
    than in so-called *shallow learning* algorithms. Shallow algorithms tend to be
    less complex and require more up-front knowledge of optimal features to use, which
    typically involves feature selection and engineering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, deep learning algorithms rely more on optimal model selection and
    optimization through model tuning. They are more well suited to solve problems
    where prior knowledge of features is less desired or necessary, and where labeled
    data is unavailable or not required for the primary use case.

    concepts and techniques from signal processing as well, including nonlinear processing
    and/or transformations.

    by a straight line. It therefore requires more than just a slope to model the
    relationship between the input, or independent variable, and the output, or dependent
    variable. Nonlinear functions can include polynomial, logarithmic, and exponential
    terms, as well as any other transformation that isn’t linear.
