    linear transformations, etc. are extremely important to understand the theory
    behind statistical methods and programming. Therefore, before starting your next
    MOOC or Machine Learning book it’s crucial to review all those concepts again.
    Most schools request students to be proficient at these methods in order to graduate,
    but the silver lining is that it won’t require too much of your time to refresh
    or obtain this knowledge.

    which is very simple, graphic and provides a great foundation prior getting into
    more complex stuff.

    Data Science is [Information Overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload),
    a term used when talking in relation to the effect of having too many resources
    at the disposal. There are hundreds of MOOCs, online courses, specialisations,
    videos, etc., but the best use of the most valuable resource that we have, “time”,
    is to pick a book and start from the basics up to new concepts, and then keep
    filling the gaps with other books.

    Learn what most all the blocks are, learn how to use them and then when you want
    to create more complex stuff look for the missing parts that you don’t have.

    that enables the input, transform and print process of information. Learning about
    programming and how code works is not only to make software, apps or create a
    great website. Learning how to program will give you the advantage to understand
    how technology impacts our lives. Instead of blaming the computer program for
    “not working”, you will now think systematically and understand where the problem
    may be. And who knows, maybe you’ll come with better ideas to improve technology
    from a user perspective.

- en: I am a big fan of TV-shows related to crime and problem solving. One example
    is [Scorpion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion_(TV_series)), which narrates
    the story of a group of geniuses who solve a different range of problems using
    technology and math skills. The highlight of these type of shows, apart from all
    the action, jokes, and hero-scenes, is the “Critical Thinking” used by the characters
    to find the solution to different kinds of problems. This is one thing that is
    not mentioned in most of the Data Science resources. The ability to find the correct
    angle to approach a problem will lead you to identify not only which tools to
    use for any problem, but will sometimes lead you to the most efficient solution.

    (tableau, excel) that can help create wonderful crisp charts. So, avoid getting
    saturated with too many options. The most important thing is how the message is
    delivered. Sometimes the simplest tools will generate a clear, relevant outcome.
