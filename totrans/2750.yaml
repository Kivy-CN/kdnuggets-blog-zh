    including some which are more advanced in nature, we felt it was time to bring
    it back to basics, and have a look at a book on foundational machine learning
    concepts. This week we introduce **[Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory
    to Algorithms](https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html)**,
    by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David.'

    paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides a theoretical account
    of the fundamentals underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations
    that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation
    of the basics, the book covers a wide array of central topics unaddressed by previous
    textbooks.

    machine learning concepts. There is no code to see here; you aren't writing algorithms
    from scratch, nor are you using existing libraries to implement any. This is strictly
    for learning theory.

    to the main concepts underlying machine learning: What is learning? How can a
    machine learn? How do we quantify the resources needed to learn a given concept?
    Is learning always possible? Can we know if the learning process succeeded or
    failed?'

    and on the other hand give a wide spectrum of different learning techniques.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the course of explaining its concepts, the book relies heavily on maths
    in doing so. In reality, thoroughly understanding the theoretical underpinnings
    of these machine learning concepts is not possible without mathematics, but this
    is often a surprise and can be overwhelming to some, so consider yourself warned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the possible shock of math-heavy theory wears off, you will find thorough
    treatments of topics from bias-variance trade-off to linear regression to model
    validation strategies to model boosting to kernel methods to prediction problems
    and beyond. And the benefit of such a thorough treatment is that your understanding
    will go deeper than just grasping the abstract intuition.
