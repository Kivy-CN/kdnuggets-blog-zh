    take the headache out of these tasks, offering a suite of methods that simplify
    the process immensely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, NumPy allows you to easily create arrays of dates, perform arithmetic
    on dates and times, and convert between different time units with just a few lines
    of code. Do you need to find the difference between two dates? NumPy can do that
    effortlessly. Do you want to resample your time series data to a different frequency?
    NumPy has you covered. This convenience and power make NumPy an invaluable tool
    for anyone working with date and time calculations, turning what used to be a
    complex challenge into a straightforward task.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DateTime refers to the representation of dates and times in a unified format.
    It includes specific calendar dates and times, often down to fractions of a second.
    This combination is very important for accurately recording and managing temporal
    data, such as timestamps in logs, scheduling events, and conducting time-based
    analyses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general programming and data analysis, **DateTime** is typically represented
    by specialized data types or objects that provide a structured way to handle dates
    and times. These objects allow for easy manipulation, comparison, and arithmetic
    operations involving dates and times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    operations, making working with temporal data in various formats and performing
    complex calculations easy and precise.

- en: In NumPy, date and time handling primarily revolve around the `datetime64` data
    type and associated functions. You might be wondering why the data type is called
    [datetime64](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.datetime64).
    This is because [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime)
    is already taken by the Python standard library.
