    deliver memorable consumer experiences. This digital transition accelerates timeframes
    for interactions, transactions, and decisions. Additionally, it generates reams
    of data with brand-new insights into operations, clients, and competition. Machine
    learning helps companies in harnessing this data to gain a competitive advantage.
    ML (Machine Learning) models can detect patterns in massive amounts of data, allowing
    them to make faster, more accurate decisions on a larger scale than humans could.
    This enables humans and applications to take quick and intelligent action.

    guided by the defined business goal. This is usually the longest stage in the
    development process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers will select data sets for the model's training and testing based
    on the type of machine learning model. Take credit risk as an example. If the
    lender wants to gather information from scanned documents, they can use an image
    recognition model; for data analysis It would be snippets of numerical or text
    data gathered from loan applicants.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most crucial stage after data collection is annotation "wrangling." Modern
    AI (Artificial Intelligence) models require highly specific data analysis and
    instructions. Annotation helps developers in increasing consistency and accuracy
    while minimizing biases to avoid malfunction after deployment.

    life cycle. This stage will be mostly managed by the development team's programmers,
    who will design and assemble the algorithm effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, developers must constantly check things during the training process.
    It is critical to detect any underlying biases in the training data as quickly
    as possible. Assume the image model cannot recognize documents, forcing it to
    misclassify them. In this situation, the parameters should instruct the model
    to focus on patterns in the image rather than pixels.

    point, the development team has done everything possible to ensure that the model
    functions optimally. The model can operate with uncurated low latency data from
    real users and is trusted to assess it accurately.

    loan defaulters. The developers should be satisfied that the model will meet the
    lending firms' expectations and perform properly.

    time. For instance, if a machine learning model for loan default prediction was
    not regularly refined, it could not detect a new default type. It is critical
    to monitor the models to detect and correct bugs. Any key findings from the monitoring
    can be used to improve the model's performance.

    and managing apps. DevOps is the industry standard for managing operations during
    the development cycle of an application. Addressing these challenges with machine
