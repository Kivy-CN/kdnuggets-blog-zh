- en: Git is an open source distributed version control and collaboration tool for
    developers. As data science, data engineering and machine learning operations
    become ever more complex, git is becoming one of the most integral and indispensable
    tools for practitioners in these areas, useful for code and data versioning. Knowing
    git is no longer an option, and failure to learn it could be holding you back.

    base and have changes integrated seamlessly, git facilitates the tracking of changes
    to code over time. It also provides a mechanism for testing out development ideas
    in separate development branches, the results of which can be integrated into
    the main project if and when desired.
