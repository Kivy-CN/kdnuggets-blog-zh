- en: Today, businesses need to be able to predict demand and trends to stay in line
    with any sudden market changes and economy swings. This is exactly where forecasting
    tools, powered by Data Science, come into play, enabling organizations to successfully
    deal with strategic and capacity planning. Smart forecasting techniques can be
    used to reduce any possible risks and assist in making well-informed decisions.
    One of our customers, an enterprise from the Middle East, needed to predict their
    market demand for the upcoming twelve weeks. They required a market forecast to
    help them set their short-term objectives, such as production strategy, as well
    as assist in capacity planning and price control. So, we came up with an idea
    of creating a custom time series model capable of tackling the challenge. In this
    article, we will cover the modelling process as well as the pitfalls we had to
    overcome along the way.

    future predictions have become more accurate. In general, forecasting techniques
    can be grouped into two categories: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative
    forecasts are applied when there is no data available and prediction is based
    only on expert judgement. Quantitative forecasts are based on time series modeling.
    This kind of models uses historical data and is especially efficient in forecasting
    some events that occur over periods of time: for example prices, sales figures,
    volume of production etc.'

    that are mainly used to model time series data without directly handling seasonality;
    [VAR models](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/79), [Holt-Winters](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/5)
    seasonal methods, [TAR models](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/82)
    and other. Unfortunately, these algorithms may fail to deliver the required level
    of the prediction accuracy, as they can involve raw data that might be incomplete,
    inconsistent or contain some errors. As quality decisions are based only on quality
    data, it is crucial to perform preprocessing to prepare entry information for
    further processing.

    situation. Each of the methods has its specific use case and can be applied with
    regard to many factors (the period over which the historical data is available,
    the time period that has to be observed, the size of the budget, the preferred
    level of accuracy) and the output required. So, we faced the question: which method/methods
    to use to obtain the desired result? As different approaches had their unique
    strengths and weaknesses, we decided to combine a number of methods and make them
    work together. In this way, we could build a time series model capable of providing
    trustworthy predictions to ensure data reliability and time/cost saving. And this
    is how we did it.'

    although it does not really provide you with a ready-to-use model. In the beginning,
    we estimated the trend (behavior) component. Such methods as Moving Average, Exponential
    Smoothing, Chow’s Adaptive Control, Winter’s Linear and Seasonal Exponential Smoothing
    methods did not provide us with the trend estimation accuracy we expected. The
    most reliable result was obtained using the [Hodrick-Prescott Filter](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mFilter/mFilter.pdf)
    technique.
