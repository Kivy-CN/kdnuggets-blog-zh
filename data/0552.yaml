    of data. So, it becomes quite natural for that data to be processed and to serve
    this purpose, powerful devices have become a necessity. Now, these machines should
    be automated or these systems should be designed in such a way that these devices
    should automatically be successful in processing these data. So, in order to build
    these systems, we require professionals like Machine learning engineers and Data
    scientists. Now, this is where the importance of data science and machine learning
    lies. There has been much confusion when it comes to data science vs machine learning
    and between the roles and responsibilities of data scientist and that of a machine
    learning engineer because these both terms are comparatively new in the technology
    industry. However, if you delve deeper into these two things then we are bound
    to find some major difference between data science and machine learning.

- en: Data science is often defined as the description, prediction and manipulation
    of data both in the structured and unstructured form. This process helps the business
    companies and organizations in taking business related decisions for the benefit
    of the company. Some might also describe it as the study of how data originates,
    what it represents and how it can be used to transform into valuable resources
    and in order for that to happen data science technology is used to mine huge amount
    of data to figure out the patterns that will help businesses have an advantage
    over others, have a look at new opportunities in the market, increase efficiencies,
    and many such benefits.

- en: There are many definitions that are used when it comes to defining data scientists
    but if we have to sum up in a few words, data scientists are simply the professionals
    who are involved with the art of data science. Data scientist responsibilities
    include solving complex problems and scenarios with their expertise in scientific
    disciplines. The roles and responsibilities of a data scientist also include special
    areas where skills are required such as speech analytics, text, image and video
    processing, etc. Each of these roles and responsibilities of a data scientist
    are very limited in number and therefore the positions for these specialists are
    of great value and thus very in demand in the market. In short, whenever a question
    is needed to be answered or a problem is needed to be solved in a business, a
    data scientist is the one they go to as data scientists gather, derive and process
    these data to derive valuable insights from the data.

    predict the results of an operation without the intervention of humans or pre-programming
    the system. The processes here have many similarities between predictive modeling
