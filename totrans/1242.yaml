    material on YouTube just waiting to be consumed. Discovery of quality content
    on the platform can be difficult, however, and we tend to cherish the discovery
    of those excellent channels when we come across them.

- en: I'm not telling you anything you don't know, but I am here to (hopefully) help
    alleviate some of the trouble of finding quality data science video content on
    YouTube. The idea here was to take a qualitative approach to identifying those
    channels of value on the platform. Our approach was to start with the intuition
    that quality content should lead to a channel being popular, which could be measured
    in the number of subscribers.

    number of subscribers, and since there in no authoritative list on which channels
    are or are not "data science" in their content, we had to also rely on keyword
    searching. Our method for determining which channels ended up on our list follows
    below, beginning with our YouTube search criteria:'

    content by subscriber, as identified by our keyword search term. The list was
    cut at 15 as the entrants became less interesting past that threshold, and we
    were wary of inundating our readers with excessive hours of video to go through.

    topics, but since each technique is really just a combination of small and simple
    steps, they are actually quite simple. My goal with StatQuest is to break down
    the major methodologies into easy to understand pieces. That said, I don't dumb
    down the material. Instead, I build up your understanding so that you are smarter.

    have been working in the data science field doing sports analytics for the last
    5 years. I have held data science positions in companies ranging from startups
    to fortune 100 organizations. I transitioned into data science from a business
    and consulting background. When I was first starting out on my data science journey
    I was extremely lost; there were very few resources for me to learn about this
    field from. I decided to start making YouTube videos to share my experiences and
    to hopefully help others get break into the data science and sports analytics
    fields.
