- en: It's no secret that mathematics is the foundation of machine learning, and is
    vital to your understanding of the underpinnings of the field. In order to succeed
    as a machine learning practitioner, knowledge of the applicable mathematical foundations
    are absolutely necessary. Where can you turn to brush up on your machine learning
    maths, or strengthen your understanding by extending that base?

    Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong, with the goal of motivating
    people to learn mathematical concepts, and which is published by Cambridge University
    Press. According to the authors, the goal of the text is to provide the necessary
    mathematical skills to subsequently read books on more advanced machine learning
    topics.'

- en: While machine learning has seen many success stories, and software is readily
    available to design and train rich and flexible machine learning systems, we believe
    that the mathematical foundations of machine learning are important in order to
    understand fundamental principles upon which more complicated machine learning
    systems are built. Understanding these principles can facilitate creating new
    machine learning solutions, understanding and debugging existing approaches, and
    learning about the inherent assumptions and limitations of the methodologies we
    are working with.

- en: As is apparent, the first part of the book covers pure mathematical concepts,
    without getting into machine learning at all. The second part turns its attention
    to applying these newfound maths skills to machine learning problems. Depending
    on your desires, you could take either a top-down or bottom-up approach to leanring
    both machine learning and its underlying maths, or pick one part the other on
    which to focus.
