- en: The final article in this nine-part series summarizes the many reasons why Machine
    Learning is not like your brain - along with a few similarities. Hopefully, these
    articles have helped to explain the capabilities and limitations of biological
    neurons, how these relate to ML, and ultimately what will be needed to replicate
    the contextual knowledge of the human brain, enabling AI to attain true intelligence
    and understanding.

- en: In examining Machine Learning and the biological brain, the inescapable conclusion
    is that ML is not very much like a brain at all. In fact, the only similarity
    is that a neural network consists of things called neurons connected by things
    called synapses. Otherwise, the signals are different, the timescale is different,
    and the algorithms of ML are impossible in biological neurons for a number of
    reasons.

- en: Neurons are so slow relative to a computer that the way they work is fundamentally
    different. Sure, there are lots of neurons and they run in a generally parallel
    process. But there are some obviously serial processes like vision and hearing,
    and the neuron’s slowness puts pretty hard limits on the number of stages possible
    in processing. If you can see or hear something and react to it in a fraction
    of a second, the number of processing “layers” in the brain is limited by the
    speed with which each layer can do its processing. The slow speed of processing
    also means that the huge training sets common in Machine Learning are implausible
    in a biological setting.

- en: The orderly layer structure of artificial neural networks is a necessity to
    their operation. If signals from downstream layers are allowed to loop back to
    earlier layers the fundamental backpropagation algorithm breaks down because its
    gradient descent surface is no longer constant. This type of looping connection
    gives a neural network a degree of internal memory so it has the capability of
    producing different results from identical inputs based on its internal state.
    This is great for the idea of more human-like thought processes, but not so good
    for an ANN because the backpropagation has no way of “knowing” what the internal
    state is.

- en: The algorithm of the perceptron is different and incompatible with what we know
    about biological neurons. The most basic summation performed by perceptrons doesn’t
    work for neurons, except in rare instances. Neurons have characteristics such
    as a “refractory period” which makes them miss incoming spikes and this leads
    to erroneous summations. This series previously showed that the summation of 0.6
    + 0.1 typically yields 0.6 (not 0.7 as summation would suggest). In fact, the
    only situation where the summation is reliable is in networks that are too slow
    to be useful. In general, the idea that the value in a perceptron represents the
    spiking frequency of a biological neuron simply doesn’t work.

- en: Machine Learning relies on reasonably precise neuron values and synapse weights,
    neither of which is plausible in a biological setting. This series demonstrated
    that the more precisely a neuron value needs to be represented, the slower each
    network layer must run. A reasonable estimate of the number of different values
    represented in a neuron would be 10—not the precise floating point numbers typical
    of ANNs.

- en: Setting precise synapse weights is even worse. While some theoretical approaches
    to setting synapse weights might be useful, the observed biological data show
    that synapse weights have a high degree of randomness. They are so high, in fact,
    that it’s logical to conclude that synapses are essentially digital, representing
    a weight of 0 or 1, and any intermediate values only indicate the confidence that
    the value is correct and/or how easily that particular data item might be retained
    or forgotten.

- en: The biggest problem with the idea that Machine Learning is like your brain is
    that backpropagation needs to set specific synapses to specific weights. As far
    as we know, there is no mechanism by which this might be possible. Synapse weights
    change in response to near-concurrent spiking of the neurons they connect and
    the infrastructure needed to set any specific synapse would require several neurons—obviating
    the value of storing information in synapse weights at all.

- en: Sure the more recent neuromorphic field has made some progress in the right
    direction but, for the most part, it still relies on backpropagation and setting
    specific synapse weights, neither of which is plausible.

- en: Taken together, while machine learning has made some remarkable advances, it
    has very little to do with the way your brain works. This is why we are pursuing
    the development of a self-adaptive graph structure, a system that has been shown
    to be possible in neurons and could be representative of how artificial general
    intelligence might be implemented.
