    patient data. They can identify patterns and anomalies in the images. However,
    their true value comes with Explainable AI (XAI). XAI clarifies how AI systems
    make their diagnostic decisions. This transparency helps doctors understand why
    the AI has made certain conclusions. XAI also explains the reasons behind each
    treatment suggestion. This helps doctors design treatment plans.
