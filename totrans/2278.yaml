    in the data instead of the underlying patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In sparse data, there may be a large number of features, but only a few of them
    are actually relevant to the analysis. This can make it difficult to identify
    which features are important and which ones are not.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the biggest problems with sparse data is that it can lead to the loss
    of potentially useful information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we have very limited data, it becomes more difficult to identify meaningful
    patterns or relationships in that data. This is because the noise and randomness
    inherent to any data set can more easily obscure essential features when the data
    is sparse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, because the amount of data available is limited, there is a higher
    chance that we will miss out on some of the truly valuable patterns or relationships
    in the data. This is especially true in cases where the data is sparse due to
    a lack of sampling, as opposed to simply being missing. In such cases, we may
    not even be aware of the missing data points and thus may not realize we are losing
    valuable information.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    mostly zero values. This can be done by setting a threshold on the percentage
    of non-zero values in each feature. Any feature that falls below this threshold
    can be removed from the dataset.

    reduction technique used to visualize high-dimensional data. It reduces the dimensionality
    of the data while preserving its global structure and has become a popular tool
    in machine learning for visualizing and clustering high-dimensional data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: t-SNE is particularly useful for working with sparse data because it can effectively
    reduce the dimensionality of the data while maintaining its structure. The t-SNE
    algorithm works by calculating pairwise distances between data points in high-
    and low-dimensional spaces. It then minimizes the difference between these distances
    in high- and low-dimensional space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use t-SNE with sparse data, the data must first be converted into a dense
    matrix. This can be done using various techniques, such as PCA or feature hashing.
    Once the data has been converted, t-SNE can be high-x to obtain a low-dimensional
    embedding of the data.
