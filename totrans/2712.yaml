- en: Scikit-learn is one of the most widely used Python machine learning libraries.
    It has a standardized and simple interface for preprocessing data and model training,
    optimisation and evaluation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The project began life as a Google Summer of Code project developed by David [Cournapeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cournapeau) and
    had its first public release in 2010\. Since its creation, the library has evolved
    into a rich ecosystem for the development of machine learning models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time the project has developed many handy functions and capabilities that
    enhance its ease of use. In this article, I will cover 10 of the most useful features
    that you might not know about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Scikit-learn has built-in data sets
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Scikit-learn API has a variety of both [**toy and real-world datasets**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html) built-in.
    These can be accessed with a single line of code and are extremely useful if you
    are either learning or just want to quickly try out a new bit of functionality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also easily generate synthetic data sets using the [**generators**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#generated-datasets) for
    regression `make_regression()` , clustering `make_blobs()` and classification `make_classification()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the loading utilities provide the option to return the data already split
    into X (features) and y (target) so that they can be used directly to train a
    model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Third-party public data sets are also easily available
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to access a greater variety of publically available data sets directly
    through Scikit-learn there is a handy function that enables you to import data
    directly from the [openml.org](https://www.openml.org/home) website. This website
    contains over 21,000 varied data sets for use in machine learning projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. There are ready-made classifiers to train baseline models
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When developing a machine learning model for a project it is sensible to create
    a baseline model first. This model should be in essence a ‘dummy’ model such as
    one that always predicts the most frequently occurring class. This provides a
    baseline on which to benchmark your ‘intelligent’ model so that you can ensure
    that it is performing better than random results for example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scikit-learn includes a `[**DummyClassifier()**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html)`for
    classification tasks and a `**DummyRegressor()**` for regression-based problems.
  prefs: []

- en: 4\. Scikit-learn has its own plotting API
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scikit-learn has a built-in [**plotting API**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/plotting.html) which
    allows you to visualise model performance without importing any other libraries.
    The following plotting utilities are included; partial dependence plots, confusion
    matrix, precision-recall curves and the ROC curve.

- en: 5\. Scikit-learn has built-in feature selection methods
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One technique to improve model performance is to train a model using only the
    best set of features or by removing redundant features. This process is known
    as feature selection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scikit-learn has a number of functions to perform [**feature selection**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_selection).
    One example is known as `[**SelectPercentile()**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectPercentile.html#sklearn.feature_selection.SelectPercentile)`.
    This method selects the top-performing X percentile features based on a chosen
    statistical method for scoring.

- en: 6\. Pipelines allow you to chain together all the steps in a machine learning
    workflow
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to making available a wide range of algorithms for machine learning,
    Scikit-learn also has a range of functions for preprocessing and transforming
    data. To facilitate reproducibility and simplicity in the machine learning workflow,
    Scikit-learn created[**pipelines**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) that
    allow you to chain together numerous preprocessing steps with the model training
    stage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pipeline stores all the steps in the workflow as a single entity which can
    be called via the fit and predict methods. When you call the fit method on a pipeline
    object the preprocessing steps and model training are performed automatically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7\. With the ColumnTransformer you can apply different preprocessing to different
    features
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many data sets, you will have different types of features that will require
    different preprocessing steps to be applied. For example, you may have a mix of
    categorical and numeric data, where you may want to convert the categorical data
    to numeric via one-hot encoding and scale the numeric variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Scikit-learn pipeline has a function called[**ColumnTransformer**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html#sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer) which
    allows you to easily specify which columns to apply the most appropriate preprocessing
    to either via indexing or by specifying the column names.

- en: 8\. You can easily output an HTML representation of your pipeline
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pipelines can often get quite complex particularly when working with real-world
    data. It is therefore very handy that Scikit-learn provides a method to output
    an [**HTML diagram**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html#visualizing-composite-estimators) of
    the steps in your pipeline.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    allows you to create a diagram of steps present in a decision tree model.

- en: 10\. There are many third-party libraries that extend the features of Scikit-learn
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many third-party libraries are available that work with Scikit-learn and extend
    its features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two examples include the [**category-encoders**](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/) library,
    which provides a greater range of preprocessing methods for categorical features,
    and the [**ELI5**](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package for greater
    model explainability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both of these packages can be also be used directly within a Scikit-learn pipeline.
