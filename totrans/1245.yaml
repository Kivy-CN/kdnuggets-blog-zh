    For the non-Singaporeans out there, [TraceTogether](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/) is
    Singapore's contact tracing initiative in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in
    Singapore. The objective of the program was to quickly identify people who might
    be in close contact with anyone who has tested positive for the virus. It comprises
    of an app or physical token which uses Bluetooth signals to store proximity records.
    As at the end December 2020, [70% of Singapore residents were supposedly on the
    programme.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-tracetogether-adoption-singapore-crosses-70-percent-13829042)

    This led to some clarifications from the ministers in-charge and a greater debate
    surrounding privacy concerns of the programme. The Minister of Home Affairs clarified
    that under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), police can and has used TraceTogether
    data to investigate "serious crimes, like murders or terrorist incidents". The [privacy
    statement on the TraceTogether website](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/common/privacystatement/index.html) was

    we can remove connections from highly connected people to make them blend in with
    normal individuals. Doing so would however remove our ability to analyse super-spreaders
    or the risk of viral spreading among front-line workers (these workers would be
    highly connected as they meet significantly more people a day). As mentioned previously,

    So far we have only considered obscuring the degree distribution in the data,

    could have calculated the number of connections which are two hops away (neighbour
    of neighbour), or the number of triangles passing through each node in the graph,
    or a measure of centrality such as the Pagerank score. There are numerous measures
    that capture different aspects of the network and how a node fits within that
    network. Obfuscating one metric does not necessarily imply that other metrics
    are equally anonymised.
