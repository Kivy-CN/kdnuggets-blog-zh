    the growing representation of female data scientists. Like the other events mentioned
    above, it’s too big for one city, but the anchor event happened in March 2018
    at Stanford University and included a live-streamed conference that [an estimated
    100,000 people](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/03/09/women-data-science/) watched.

    edition of WiDS attracted 75,000 people, and the details of the more recent conference

    Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (PNU). PNU is the world’s largest university
    for women, and the program saw [57 students complete degree programs](http://www.abouther.com/node/12511/people/features/largest-university-women-world-just-certified-its-first-saudi-arabian)

    careers during their youth, the foundations could be laid for later data science
    work as adults. However, they often lose interest before it’s time to choose their
    college courses. A study by Microsoft and KRC Research aimed to [find out why
    that happens](https://news.microsoft.com/features/why-do-girls-lose-interest-in-stem-new-research-has-some-answers-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/).
