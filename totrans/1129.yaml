    Data Science, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning projects. These are the packages
    that I found most useful during my career as a Machine Learning Engineer and Python
    Programmer. While such a list can never be complete, it surely gives you a few
    tools for every use case.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The open-source computer vision library, Open-CV, is your best friend when it
    comes to images and videos. It offers great efficient solutions to common image
    problems such as face detection and object detection. Or, as we can see below,
    Edge detection, the process of detecting various lines inside an image. If you
    are planning to work with images in data science, this library is a must. Open
    CV gathered a massive 56,000 stars on Github and made working with image data
    several times faster and easier for me.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data visualization is your main way to communicate with non-Data Wizards. If
    you think about it, even apps are merely a way to visualize various data interactions
    behind the scene. Matplolib is the basis of image visualization in Python. From
    visualizing your edge detection algorithm to looking at distributions in your
    data, Matplolib is your partner in crime. 14,000 stars on GitHub and surely a
    great library to start contributing to. I made, for example, this animated lineplot
    in a recent video using seaborn and matplotlib.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that we are talking about Python packages, we have to take a moment to
    talk about their master pip. Without it, you can’t install any of the others.
    Its only purpose is to install packages from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) or
    places such as GitHub. But you can also use it to install your own custom-build
    packages. 7400 stars just don’t reflect how important it is for the Python Community.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python wouldn't be the most popular programming language without Numpy. It is
    the foundation of all data science and machine learning packages, an essential
    package for all math-intensive computations with Python. All that nasty linear
    algebra and fancy math you learned in university are basically handled by Numpy
    in a very efficient way. Its syntax style can be seen in many of the important
    data libraries. 18,100 stars on GitHub give you a glimpse into how crucial of
    a basis for the python ecosystem it is.
  prefs: []

- en: 5\. Pandas
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Built mostly on Numpy, it is the heart of all data science you can ever do with
    Python. “import pandas as pd” is the first line of code I type in the morning,
    and it is much more than Excel on steroids. Its declared goal is to become the
    most powerful open source data tool available in any language, and I think they
    are more than halfway there. While it often is not the fastest tool, there are
    many sub tools to speed it up, such as Dask, swifter, koalas, and others that
    build on their syntax and ease of use to make it also useful for big data projects.
    30,900 stars on GitHub, truly the starting point for any aspiring data wizard.

    is a pain. It can compute given the current date, the next month, or the distance
    between dates in seconds. And most importantly, it handles the timezone issues
    for you, which, if you ever tried doing it without a library, can be a *massive* pain.
    1,600 stars on GitHub show you that gladly not many people have to go through
    the frustrating process of working with timezones.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If Machine Learning is your passion, then the Scikit-Learn project has got you
    covered. The best place to get started and also the first place to look for any
    algorithm that you could possibly want to use for your predictions. It also features
    tons of handy evaluation methods and training helpers, such as grid search. Whatever
    predictions you are trying to get out of your data, sklearn (as it is often aliased)
    will help you do it more efficiently. 47,000 stars on GitHub tell you why Python
    is the Machine Learners Language of choice.

- en: This is kind of confusing, but there is a [Scipy *library*](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html),
    and there is a Scipy *stack*. Most of the libraries and packages I wrote about
    in this article are part of the Scipy *stack *for scientific computing in Python.
    This includes Numpy, Matplolib, IPython, and Pandas. Just like Numpy, you most
    probably won’t use Scipy itself, but the above-mentioned Scikit-Learn library
    heavily relies on it. Scipy provides the core mathematical methods to do the complex
    machine learning processes. Again somewhat strange that it has only around 8,500
    stars on GitHub.

- en: If you wonder what my favorite Python package is, look no further. It’s this
    little application called TQDM. All it really does is that it gives you a processing
    bar that you can throw around **any for loop**, and it will give you a progress
    bar that tells you how long each iteration takes on average, and most importantly,
    how long it will take such that you know exactly for how long you can watch YouTube
    videos before you have to go back to work. 19,300 stars for my favorite package,
    which gave me more peace of mind in the last years than any other package.

    is today. Tensorflow is an entire end-to-end open-source machine learning platform
    that includes many more packages and tools such as tensorboard, collab, and the
    What-If tool. Chosen by many of the world-leading companies for their deep learning
    needs, TensorFlow is, with a staggering 159,000 stars on GitHub, the most popular
    python package of all time. It is used for various deep learning use cases by
    companies such as Coca-Cola, Twitter, Intel, and its creator Google.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A deep learning framework made for humans as their slogan goes. It made rapidly
    developing new neural networks a thing. I remember before Keras it was quite the
    effort to write even a simple sequential model. It is based on top of TensorFlow
    and really the way developers start when they first try around with a new architecture
    for their model. It reduced the entry barrier for starting to program neural networks
    by so much that most high school students could do it by now. Keras is another
    hugely popular Python package at around 52,000 stars.
  prefs: []

- en: 12\. PyTorch
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TensorFlow’s main competitor in the deep learning space. It has become a great
    alternative and my personal favorite for developing neural networks. I think its
    community is a bit stronger in the realm of natural language processing, while
    TensorFlow tends to be a bit more on the image and video side. As with Keras,
    it has its own simplifying library, Pytorch Lightning, which I made an [entire
    tutorial about to make sure you will never again have to work to be good at deep
    learning.](https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-lightning-machine-learning-zero-to-hero-in-75-lines-of-code-7892f3ba83c0) 50,000
    stars on GitHub may seem like little compared to Tensorflow, but when looked at
    over time, it is truly catching up fast.

    to the classical world of statistics. It contains many helpful statistical evaluations
    and tests. In contrast, these tend to be a lot more stable and surely something
    any Data Scientist should use every now and then. 6,600 stars are probably more
    feedback on the coolness of deep learning vs. classical statistics.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The big alternative to Matplolib is Plotly, objectively more beautiful, and
    far better for interactive data visualizations. The main difference to Matplolib
    is that it is browser-based and slightly harder to start with, but once you understand
    the basics, it is truly an amazing tool. Its strong integration with Jupyter makes
    me believe that it will become more and more standard and make people move away
    from Matplolib integrations. 10,000 stars on GitHub and slowly catching up with
    Matplolib.

    trying to make sense of any text. It contains extensive algorithms for various
    grammatical transformations such as stemming and incredible lists of symbols that
    you might want to remove before processing text in your models, such as dots and
    stop words. It will also detect what is most likely a sentence and what is not
    to correct grammatical errors made by the “writers” of your dataset. All in all,
    give it a shot if you are working with text. Again 10,000 stars, which is crazy
    for a niche package like this one

    is rather pointless. Luckily the Internet contains information about almost everything.
    But sometimes, it’s not stored in a nice CSV-like format, and you first have to
    go out into the wild and gather it. This is exactly where scrapy can help you
    by making it easy to crawl websites around the globe using a few lines of code.
    Next time you have an idea where no one pre-gathered the dataset for you. Be sure
    to check out this 41,000-star project.

    data structure called HTML. To make use of that nested craziness, beautiful soup
    has been created. It helps you extract various aspects of the HTML, such as titles
    and tags, and lets you iterate them like normal dictionaries. It helped me in
    several little projects where I was interested in user comments on websites that
    do not offer an open API.

    XGBoost is there to rescue you from waiting weeks for the computations to end.
    It is a highly scalable and distributed gradient boosting library that will make
    sure your calculations run as efficiently as possible. Available in almost all
    common data science languages and stacks.

    only get you this far. PySpark is the Python implementation of the very popular
    Apache Spark data processing engine. It is like pandas but built with distributed
    computing in mind from the very beginning. If you ever get the feeling that you
    can't process your data fast enough to keep track, this surely is exactly what
    you need. They also started focusing on massive parallel Machine Learning for
    your very big data use cases. 30,000 stars on Github make it one of the most popular
    data processing tools out there.
