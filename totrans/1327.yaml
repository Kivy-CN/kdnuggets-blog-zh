    student](https://medium.com/@felix.vemmer/how-what-and-why-you-should-learn-python-as-a-business-student-ea539df88698) through

    Furthermore, I also saved all data to an SQL lite database via an items pipeline to
    avoid duplicates and turned on to log each URL request to make sure I do not put
    more load on the server if I stop and restart the scraping process.

- en: Come up with a blog post idea that answers a burning question you had or solves
    your own problem. Ideally, the timing of the topic is relevant and has not been
    analysed by anyone else before. Based on your experience, website structure, and
    complexity, choose a framework that matches the scraping job best. During data
    cleaning, leverage existing libraries to solve painful data cleaning tasks like
    parsing timestamps or cleaning text. Finally, choose how you can best share your
    work. Both an interactive deployed model/dashboard or a well written medium blog
    post can differentiate you from other applicants on the journey to become a data
    scientist.
