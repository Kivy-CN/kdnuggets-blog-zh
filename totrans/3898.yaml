    your second, third, or even fourth redraft that you’ll write the Great American
    Novel. The same principle can be applied to writing code! Rather than spending
    all your time trying to get it perfect on the first try, you’ll find it’s often
    quicker to hammer out bad code and then improve it. Whatever your architecture,
    choice of OO language, or skill as a programmer, you’ll find that proper refactoring
    makes your code simpler, more readable, and less prone to bugs.'

    you. Written by Agile coach Christian Clausen, it’s published by Manning Publications—so
    you know its quality is assured. Rather than complex “code smells” or other techniques
    you can only learn from years as a developer, it teaches you concrete principles
    for refactoring that anyone can learn regardless of their experience level.

    and patterns illustrated by detailed code samples. Chapter by chapter you’ll put
    techniques into action by refactoring a complete 2D puzzle game and before you
    know it, you’ll be making serious and tangible improvements to your codebase.
