- en: '![online-dating](../Images/cbc2001f70f00d64c7689314473cc48c.png)One of the
    first things I did when I moved to Montreal was installing [Tinder](http://www.tinder.com/).
    For those of you not familiar with the online meat market, Tinder is a dating
    app showing nearby users you can like or dislike by their profile pictures. After
    using the app for a while, I discovered that although I consistently disliked
    girls with a lot of piercings and tattoos (no offense, just not my type), the
    app kept showing me these profiles. It surprised me that Tinder did not use my
    history of swipes to learn what type of girls I like.'

    I have tried by labeling over 9K profile pictures on Tinder and using [deep learning](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/remaking-google-facebook-deep-learning-tackles-robotics/),
    the latest revolution in artificial intelligence. In this blog post, I will provide
    a high-level view how I used these techniques to predict my Tinder swipes. You
    can find the technical details in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00359),
    which was accepted for the [ICML deep learning workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/deeplearning2015/).'

- en: Computers have been around for many decades, but there still exists a lot of
    problems that the most powerful computers struggle to solve, yet we (as human
    beings) can do without effort. You can think of detecting faces in pictures, recognizing
    speech and translating text. The problem is that although we perform such tasks
    easily, we cannot explain how we do it. That means, we can not come up with a
    set of rules that can be transformed into a computer program.

- en: Is predicting attractiveness from a profile picture such a task? Yes, it is
    simply too difficult to specify a set of rules to who you're attracted. For some
    of you this might sound counter-intuitive because you can specify a clear list
    of traits e.g. blue eyes, blond hair, etc. However, even if you could do that,
    you have to believe me that it is too complex to construct a program by hand that
    detects such characteristics in images.

    a split of a second whether you like her/him. This suggests a better strategy:
    we let the computer program itself by showing it profile pictures of girls you
    do or do not find attractive. We call this *machine learning* because the program
    learns a set of attractiveness rules from these profile pictures.'

- en: In deep learning, the structure of the program is an artificial neural network
    which is inspired by a biological neural network i.e. the brain. Neural networks
    are called *deep* when they consists of several layers of connected neurons as
    shown in the figure above. Each neuron is connected to a set of neurons in the
    previous layer. The strength of those connections (shown in red) determine to
    what image pattern the neuron responds. You can think of it as an adjustable filter,
    only responding when it sees a particular pattern.
  prefs: []

- en: The connection strengths of the network are randomly initialized, meaning that
    all neurons are just random filters. Therefore, when we feed an image to the network
    (by inputting the intensity of its pixels), only a few neurons in the first layer
    will respond, which in turn let some random neurons in the next layer to be active
    (and so forth till the output). As a result, the output of the network will be
    random like or dislike.

- en: Therefore, in order to make good predictions, we need to *train* the network.
    We do so by inputting a profile picture and propagating it through the network
    to get the output. If the network's prediction is different from the desired output
    (like or dislike), we adjust its filters (i.e. its connection strengths) to make
    the prediction more correct. How we exactly adjust the filters is rather difficult
    and outside the scope of this blog post, all you need to know is that we can do
    it. The training phase is nothing more than repeating this process for many examples,
    and then hope that the network predicts well for profile pictures it has not seen
    yet.

- en: After training, we often observe that the neurons in the first layer respond
    to edges and color blobs, while the next layer uses these observations to detect
    more complex patterns such as eyes and ears. The last layer might detect complete
    faces or piercings and tattoos (which is important to predict my preferences).
