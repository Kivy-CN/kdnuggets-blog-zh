    still seems to be some confusion as to what automated machine learning actually
    is. Is it the same thing as automated data science?

    are defined independently of one another.

    to the very broad concept of extracting knowledge and insight from data. Just
    think about how broad and inclusive this description is. So inclusive is it, in
    fact, that there is no agreed upon definition or scope for data science. Sure,
    lots of attempts at both can be found, and there may be some agreement on where
    very loose boundaries are, but no one will convince me that there exists some
    definition to any notable degree of specificity that a majority of data scientists
    would accept. Also, what exactly is a **data scientist**?'

- en: '**Machine learning**, according to [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html),
    is "concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically
    improve with experience." Slightly more formally, such computer programs are "said
    to learn from experience *E* with respect to some class of tasks *T* and performance
    measure *P*, if its performance at tasks in *T*, as measured by *P*, improves
    with experience *E*" (again, [Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html)).'

- en: I (and many others) would argue that machine learning is a relatively well-defined
    and comparatively narrow field, while "data science" is most definitely not. Just
    by adding the term "automated" in front of these 2 separate, distinct concepts
    does not somehow make them equivalent. Machine learning and data science are not
    the same thing, just like **automated** machine learning is not the same thing
    as **automated** data science. Machine learning is but one of many tools that
    a data scientist has at their disposal.

    is "the automation of automating automation." Silly wordplay? Not at all. Comparing
    "regular" computer programming to machine learning, [Sebastian Raschka has said](/2016/05/explain-machine-learning-software-engineer.html)
    that computer programming is about automation, and machine learning is "all about
    automating automation." If that's true, then automated machine learning is "the
    automation of automating automation." Programming relieves us by managing rote
    tasks; machine learning allows computers to learn how to best perform these rote
    tasks; automated machine learning allows for computers to learn how to optimize
    the outcome of learning how to perform these rote actions.

- en: Since, in my view, the practice of machine learning comes down to 2 main overarching
    tasks, in a restrained practical definition we can consider the core of automated
    machine learning to be 1) the automated optimization of feature engineering and/or
    selection, and 2) hyperparameter tuning. Semantically, the training of a machine
    learning model, while the result of these automated steps, is incidental to the
    automated machine learning process, while automated steps such as model evaluation
    and model selection are ancillary to the core. See Figure 1.

- en: So what is **automated data science**? Automated data science would encompass
    attempts to automate any portion of the [data science process](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/03/data-science-process-rediscovered.html)
    (such as CRISP-DM, Figure 2), the process of extracting knowledge and insight
    from data. This would *include* machine learning, as one of the data scientist's
    tools. So automated machine learning can be used as a tool in the context of automated
    data science, but automated machine learning is not equivalent to automated data
    science.

- en: But automated data science would extend beyond this, and could include either
    the full or partial automation of tasks such as exploratory data analysis and
    data visualization, for example. You may also consider automated data collection,
    data wrangling, or data preparation to be included under this umbrella.

- en: Some aspects of data science are obviously more difficult to automate than others
    (hypothesis testing, communication, domain knowledge, formulating data-based strategies,
    etc.), which is why "data science" can no more be fully automated than can be
    the scientific method applied to any other domain (there is a difference between
    automating the entire process and automating the tools used within the process).
    Human involvement, for the foreseeable future, is paramount, not only for overseeing
    and correcting course for any level of automation, but also to kick off searches
    for insight. We may be able to automate exploratory investigations of what questions
    we should be looking to potentially apply the data science process to in the hopes
    of answering, and even have this phase augmented by facts and figures, but the
    human element will need to make nuanced decisions on which courses of action are
    worthy of pursuit.

    has stated that such automation tools should not be seen as replacements to data
    scientists, but as data science assistants (TPOT is billed as "your data science
    assistant," a nod to the fact that machine learning may not be equivalent to data
    science, but is often an integral part of a data science pipeline). Such tools
    eliminate repetitive tasks such as running experiments on vast combinations of
    model hyperparameters and selected features and instead allow the humans in the
    process to be able to focus on more important and guiding issues.'
