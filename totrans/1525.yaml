    with large holdings in innovators like Nvidia, Google, and Equinix. They’ve also
    been making splashes in the private market recently, dubbed [by Institutional
    Investor](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1c2lcwx8z6wwz/Tiger-Cub-Coatue-Rolls-Out-New-Venture-Capital-Fund)
    “one of the most aggressive hedge fund investors” with noteworthy investments
    in Instacart, Lyft, Box.com, [jet.com](http://jet.com), Uber, and Snapchat. They
    launched two venture capital funds in 2018, and in February, Founder and Chief

    innovations, allocating more than 22% to healthcare, 21% to technology, and 16%
    to energy. The firm has expanded its geographic footprint in the last year, and
    recently launched operations in Sydney to focus on macro investing. The hedge
    fund raised more than $4 billion in outside capital in 2018, bringing total assets
    under management to roughly $13 billion (as of November 2018).
