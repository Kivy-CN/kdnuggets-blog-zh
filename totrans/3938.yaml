    how to ramp up your data science skills by borrowing tips and tricks from the
    developer community. These suggestions will help you become a more proficient
    data scientist who is loved by your team members and stakeholders.

    average developer, but they debug like a boss, they introduce less bugs because
    they test their code, they mentor junior developers, write their own documentation,
    and have a lot of other broad skills that go beyond knowing how to code.

    who is responsible for quality control, why there might be gaps in the data (for
    instance a change in vendors or a change in extraction methods), what might be
    missing and what other data sources could potentially be added to create a more

    Don’t be afraid to ask what people are working on and discuss what you’re working
    on too because you never know when people are doing duplicate work or if they
    have a cleaner version of data that you need access to. It’ll save you a ton of
    time being able to query a database versus making multiple API calls to SiteCatalyst
    for example.

    in my writing classes in college. It’s easy to get caught up on your own cleverness
    and use the latest word of the day to get your ideas across, but like programming
    you’ll not only likely confuse yourself, you’ll confuse others.

- en: In the above Scala example, the first line shows the `sortBy` method using a
    shorthand syntax. While it’s concise, it’s hard to think through what the underscore
    stands for. Even though this is a common pattern that many people use as an argument
    name in an anonymous function, for less advanced developers (or when you haven’t
    looked at your code for a while), it becomes tedious to figure out what the code
    does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second example we at least use an argument name, plus it’s showing assignment
    and we can see that it’s sorting by the next to last element in the sequence x.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When code is less abstracted, it’s easier to debug later so in the third example
    I’m going to explicitly name my argument so it’s representative of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When your brain has to go through each step and either look up or recall what
    the shorthand code does, it takes longer to debug and longer to add a new feature
    so even though using shorthand such as the examples above are concise and faster
    to type initially, in the long run it will benefit both you and others to avoid
    being too clever.

- en: Using a single letter to name a sequence doesn’t provide useful information
    at all because likely you are pulling your data from somewhere like an API, a
    database or a data stream in Spark where you’d have to run your code to see what
    “x” is.

    For example X is often used in machine learning libraries where X is known to
    mean the observed data while y is the variable that is trying to be predicted
    for. In this case it’s preferable to use the conventions of your field where “model”,
    “fit”, “predicted”, and “x” and “y” mean the same thing to everyone in that field.

    conventions of the language your are using. For example, I recommend you checking

    with your code, it will make refactoring and debugging both easier and faster.
