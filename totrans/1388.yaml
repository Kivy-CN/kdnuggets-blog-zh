    data science learning journey. Especially when we advocate for working on data
    science projects in ‘[How to Become a Data Scientist in 2020](https://selflearndatascience.com/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/)’,
    you should always be on the lookout for interesting datasets that you could experiment
    on. Here we list down 3 best sites where we get our datasets from for our data
    science projects.

- en: You should be very familiar with Kaggle by now. Companies have been releasing
    their data in Kaggle to harness the strength of the community and solve their
    real-life problems. This makes Kaggle the perfect place to find datasets with
    real problem statements to solve. If you want to practice building machine learning
    models without the hassle of generating or labeling data, Kaggle is the best place
    for you. Furthermore, the notebooks section of Kaggle allows users to share their
    codes and models, which serve as a great learning resource. I highly recommend
    beginners to find their first data science project in Kaggle.

    comprehensive Dataset search engine available. It claims to index more than 25
    million datasets online and has helped scientists and researchers to better locate
    datasets since its inception in Sep 2018\. Armed with the function to filter according
    to data types, date updated, and more, the Google Dataset Search has become the
    favorite for most of us.

    engine.

- en: When looking for data science datasets, you might want to look at what your
    government has made publicly available. These data, when put into good use, might
    result in solutions that benefit your community as a whole. Data.gov is an open
    data lake by the U.S. Government, where the government’s data are released to
    promote research and development within the scientific communities. At Data.gov,
    data are categorized into topics such as health, energy, or education, making
    it easy to navigate and find the data you need.

- en: What if you are not a resident in the U.S.? Try searching for “data your country”
    with your favorite search engine. More often than not, you will find sites where
    your local government publishes its data. For example, [here](https://data.gov.in/)
    is the site for India while [this](https://data.gov.uk/) is for the UK.

    Remember, practicing data science is the best way to learn. So keep these sites
    handy as you will definitely need it.
