    and polymaths. It requires an understanding of computational and applied maths,
    which can be off-putting for aspirational data scientists from a purely coding
    background. However, having a grasp of mathematical statistics is important, especially
    if you plan to create algorithms and data models for forecasting outcomes.

    This goes for concepts in [probability and statistics](/2022/06/statistics-probability-data-science.html)
    too. Moment-generating functions (MGF) are one of these concepts all data scientists
    should know. The following guide will answer what they are and how you can implement
    them programmatically.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you take the term moment-generating functions literally, what you can see
    is that MGFs are functions that generate moments. But what are moments? In statistics,
    we use what is known as a **distribution** to illustrate how values are spread
    in a field, i.e., which values are common and which ones are rare.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists and statisticians use **moments** to measure distributions.
    Fundamentally, [moments are parameters of the distribution](https://www.statistics.com/glossary/moments/),
    and they can be used to determine or describe its shape, allowing you to extract
    information (metadata) about your data. We’ll look at the four most common moments
    below.

    – how far the values are from the average or norm. This moment is ultimately used
    to illustrate or find any deviations in the distribution or data set. We typically
    use the standard deviation, which is represented by the square root of the variance
    [E(X^3)].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kurtosis is the fourth moment. We use it to measure and indicate the occurrence
    of outliers by using the “tailedness” of the distribution. Thus, kurtosis is most
    concerned with the tails of the distribution. It helps us ascertain if the distribution
    is normal or filled with extreme values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, normal distributions have a kurtosis value of 3 or an excess kurtosis
    of 0\. Distributions with this type of kurtosis are referred to as **mesokurtic**.
    A distribution with lighter tails and a kurtosis value lesser than three (K <
    3) is referred to as having **negative kurtosis**. In these cases, the [distribution
    is typically broad](/2021/01/comprehensive-guide-normal-distribution.html) and
    flat and referred to as **platykurtic**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, a distribution with heavier tails and a kurtosis value greater
    than three (K > 3) is referred to as having a **positive kurtosis**. In these
    cases, the distribution is thin, has a pointed or high peak, and is referred to
    as **leptokurtic**. High kurtosis indicates that the distribution contains outliers.

    distribution to find its moments. In programming, searching for the right integration
    makes algorithms far more complex and requires more computing resources, increasing
    the load or run-time of the program. MGFs and their derivations are far more efficient
    at finding moments.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finding the moments of a distribution without using an MGF is possible but calculating
    higher-order moments without using MGF gets complicated. Python’s built-in statistic
    module comes with a sufficient list of functions that can be used to calculate
    moments from a dataset. However, this isn’t the only option for [working with
    statistical functions](/2022/10/statistical-functions-python.html) in Python.

- en: The above guide provides a basic exploration of moments and moment-generating
    functions. As a programmer or data scientist, you may never have to manually calculate
    raw moments or try to derive central moments manually. In all likelihood, there
    are a variety of modules and libraries that do that for you. However, it’s always
    important to understand what goes on in the background.
