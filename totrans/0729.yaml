  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get started with data science, building programming foundations in a programming
    language like Python is important. The [Programming Methodology](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1226/)
    class teaches Python programming from the ground up and does not assume any previous
    programming experience.

- en: In this course, you’ll learn problem solving with Python while becoming familiar
    with the features of the language. You’ll start with the basics such as variables
    and control flow and then learn about built-in data structures like lists and
    dictionaries.
