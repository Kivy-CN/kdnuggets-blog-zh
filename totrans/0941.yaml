- en: What is Data Imputation?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data imputation utilizes various statistical methods in the process of replacing
    your missing data values with a substitute value. This allows you, the business,
    and the customer to be able to retain the most out of the data and provide insightful
    knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you substitute a data point, it is called ‘unit imputation’. If you substitute
    a component of a data point, it is called ‘item imputation’.
  prefs: []

- en: So why do we impute the data, rather than just remove it?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it would be the easier option to remove the data points that have missing
    values, this is not always the best option. Not only will you reduce the size
    of your dataset by removing the missing values, but this can lead to further issues
    of incorrect and untrustworthy analysis.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are specific libraries that struggle and are naturally incompatible to
    handle missing data. This can cause delays in your workflow/process as well as
    lead to further errors.

- en: 2\. Issues with the dataset
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you remove missing values, it will cause a decrease in the size of your dataset.
    However, keeping missing values in your dataset can have a major effect on the
    variables, the correlation, the statistical analysis, and the overall outcome.

- en: 3\. Final outcome
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your priority when working with data and models is to ensure that the final
    model is free from errors, efficient, and trustworthy to be used in real-world
    cases. Missing data will naturally lead to bias in the dataset, leading to incorrect
    analysis.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the same class as above, I mentioned that you could use mean, median,
    or most frequent. Most frequent works with categorical features, that are either
    string or numerical. It replaces the missing value with the most frequent value
    within that column.
