- en: Python is a popular high-level object-oriented programming language which is
    used widely by a huge number of software developers. Guido van Rossum designed
    this in 1991, and Python software foundation has further developed it. But the
    question is, with dozens of programming languages based on OOP concepts already
    available, why this new one? So, the main purpose to develop this language is
    to emphasize code readability and scientific and mathematical computing (e.g.
    NumPy, SymPy, Orange).
