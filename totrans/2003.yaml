- en: ETL and ELT are data integration pipelines that transfer data from multiple
    sources to a single centralized source and perform some transformation and processing
    steps to it. The difference between these two is ETL transforms the data before
    loading, and ELT transforms the data after loading.

- en: ETL is the first standardized data integration method that emerged in the 1970s
    due to the evolution of disk storage. As the name suggests, it first extracts
    the raw data from the source and then transforms it before loading it into the
    target database, i.e. (Extract ? Transform ? Load)
  prefs: []

    the data on a separate server before loading it to the target database.

- en: In the early 2000s, cloud computing became more common, and the development
    of data lakes and warehouses created a revolution in data storage. Now businesses
    can access cheap and unlimited cloud storage for loading their data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This leads to developing a new data integration pipeline, i.e. ELT (Extract,
    Load, Transform). The raw data can be stored inside the data warehouse and queried
    directly from it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, inside ELT, the raw data is extracted from the source and directly
    stored in the data warehouse without any transformations. Unlike in ETL, the transformation
    step is performed in a separate server before loading, which creates additional
    delays and rigidity in the system.

- en: ETL and ELT differ in two ways. In ETL, data is transformed before loading,
    and in ELT, the data is transformed after loading.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ETL has a rigid pipeline because it only supports legacy database architecture,
    but ELT is flexible and supports data re-querying.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ETL is comparatively slower than ELT, involving an additional data transformation
    step before loading. But in ELT, this transformation can be done simultaneously
    with loading.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ETL can only be used with in-premise or structured data. But ELT can be used
    with any structured, unstructured or semi-structured data.

- en: To harness the power of data in today's business, we need efficient and robust
    data pipelines which can extract, load and transform data from multiple sources
    to a single centralized storage so that it can be used for analysis. Here ETL
    and ELT data pipelines come into the picture. But choosing between ETL and ELT
    will depend entirely on the business’s needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, an ETL pipeline can be used when we have strict consistency and data
    quality requirements before loading the data. Or when we have complex data integration
    and transformation steps to be performed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While ELT can be used when we want to store huge amounts of data, and it requires
    quicker and more efficient processing. ELT also provides flexibility in the database
    depending on the changing business needs.
