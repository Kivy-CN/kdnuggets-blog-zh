    sites and platforms. It is called upon to regulate the interaction between the
    visitors and specialists so that it would be fair and peaceful.

    fraud and provide a high level of security for the visitors. The platforms do
    their best to get the trust of their visitors. Safe and trusted platforms are
    expected to be actively visited by a broad spectrum of people eager to communicate,
    buy, learn, etc. There is nothing strange that the words trust and safety are
    used together so often. These terms are closely interrelated by their nature.
    Trust is a multidimensional concept. Trusting to a brand, source, etc. strengthens
    confidence and feeling of safety to the potential users.

    of a dialogue. Chatbots are widespread. Therefore, vast amounts of personal data

    operation. As a result, they may become subjects for attacks or fraud. In such
    a case, the limitations and privacy boundaries must be precisely defined. Trust
    is critical in situations when the trustor largely depends on a trustee. Reliability
    of the chatbots may be determined according to the trust score. Trust Score is
    a mechanism that is a transaction registry containing successfully verified transactions.
