    of the general public, it takes on more and more of a mystical quality as time
    goes on.

- en: People hear the term and often think of machine learning algorithms exclusively,
    which can lead Joan Q. Public to think of the equally-misleading term, artificial
    intelligence. But you and I know this should not be the case. Algorithms are the
    specific steps we take to solve particular problems. That's all, nothing more.
    There is no magic involved.

- en: Of course, we can speak of **machine learning algorithms**, which are the specific
    steps that implementations of machine learning concepts take, but in terms of
    algorithm parlance, these would just be another set of steps taken, with no consideration
    to the sorcery of machine learning or AI. But I digress.

    of the specific steps of particular computational concepts programmatically. **Exactly**
    what are we doing with data, or some resource, and in **exactly** what order?
    If you come from a CS background, undoubtedly one of your first CS courses after
    Intro to Programming 101 was Algorithms, or perhaps Data Structures and Algorithms,
    the combination of **what** and **how** together, in data terms. If not from a
    CS background, perhaps you learned algorithms while taking up programming on your
    own, or learning data science online, or by some other method.'

- en: freeCodeCamp has just released [Algorithms in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW_OS3LGB9Q),
    a free full course in learning algorithms in one of the most popular programming
    languages in existence. The course was developed by [Joy Brock](https://www.youtube.com/c/PythonLearningChannel)
    in collaboration with [realtoughcandy.io](https://realtoughcandy.com/), so be
    sure to have a look at their other offerings.

- en: Not only does Python enjoy widespread popularity as a general purpose programming
    language — meaning you can do all sorts of programming tasks with it, almost anything
    imaginable (within reason) — Python is also one of the most in-demand languages
    in the worlds of data science and machine learning. As an added bonus, Python
    is a notoriously beginner-friendly language, making it all the easier to understand
    algorithms and other programmatic and computational concepts with its help.

    permutations, the *N* queens problem, and the travelling salesman problem. You
    will dive into the bread and butter of programmatic algorithms: sorting! You then
    cover some data structures and learn how algorithms and structures work together
    with concepts such as hash tables. You''ll also cover topics such as dynamic programming,
    matrix multiplication, and what makes an algorithm greedy.'

    practitioners alike (or, more accurately, *one* of the go-to languages). Pair
    your learning of algorithms with Python and take another step to excelling today.
    Good luck!
