    and analyzing data stored in relational databases and performing various operations
    on the data is **SQL (Structured Query Language)**. It is an essential skill for
    data analysts, data scientists, and data warehousing professionals because it
    allows users to create, modify, and query the data in these databases.

- en: As data continues to grow in volume, variety, and complexity, the significance
    of data integration will only increase. Businesses that are able to effectively
    integrate data from multiple sources using SQL will be better equipped to make
    informed decisions and gain a competitive advantage.ETL and ELT are common ways
    of data extraction from multiple sources, transformation into an analysis-ready
    format, and loading into a database or data warehouse that we will be discussing
    in this article.

- en: ETL( Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT( Extract, Load, Transform) are two common
    ways used to integrate data from multiple sources into a destination database
    or data warehouse. The main difference between the two approaches is the order
    in which the data transformation and loading steps are performed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In **ETL**, the data is extracted from the source systems, transformed into
    a format suitable for analysis, and then loaded into the destination database.
    This is the traditional approach to data integration and is well-suited for cases
    where the source systems are relatively simple, and the transformation process
    is relatively straightforward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In **ELT**, the data is extracted from the source systems and loaded into the
    destination database first, and then transformed into a suitable format for analysis.
    This approach is becoming increasingly popular in modern data infrastructures
    due to the capability of modern data storage to handle large volumes of data and
    the increasing complexity of data transformation processes.
