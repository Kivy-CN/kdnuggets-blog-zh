    on new Data Scientists that are sometimes heavily overlooked. Soft skills are
    just as important to hiring managers as hard skills. I will be going through the
    ones that I believe are the most important.

    but also have the ability to adapt their current skills and develop new skills.

    and new tools are being released, and older ones are being improved. New algorithms
    are constantly being introduced, therefore if you are not willing to learn; it
    can be very frustrating for your team manager.

    can also act as a blocker in the success of your career as you will constantly
    be doubting your abilities because your main goal is to achieve. Concentrating
    on the skills you currently possess and how you can develop them by learning new
    skills is one way to overcome imposter syndrome.

    in a particular project or your previous roles; proving if you were willing to
    learn or if you accepted that you didn’t know the skill and continued the same.

    current ones is another way to prove to the hiring manager that you are willing
    to learn. There are various platforms where you can achieve this as a Data Scientist,
    such as [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/),
    [edX](https://www.edx.org/), and more.

    what is required to benefit the business, rather than just completing a task because
    you were asked. It differentiates if you are an active member of the team and

    who have little technical skill and understanding. Being able to identify problems
    in the company's current problems or chosen solutions, are proposing your own
    will make you stand out.

    improve, and when you get the job it will prove to the company as a whole that

- en: It is easy to say ‘yes’ to every task thrown at you. But it is harder to say
    ‘I don’t think this is the right solution, how about trying X?’. A lot of businesses
    are failing to strive as they lack adopting other team members' suggestions and
    solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no harm in putting your suggestion forward, the worst thing that can
    happen is that you are wrong or your manager gives you a better understanding
    of why the business cannot use that particular solution. In the end, you’re still
    learning.

    more harm than good. Employers will believe that you are not an active employee
    and you’re not willing to contribute to the success of the business.
