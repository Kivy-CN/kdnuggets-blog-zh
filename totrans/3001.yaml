- en: We have all heard of Linear Regression. It’s what we all learn in our first
    semester of statistics. It is our default technique when we have a continuous
    outcome variable. A refresher on Linear Regression can be found [here](/2016/11/linear-regression-least-squares-matrix-multiplication-concise-technical-overview.html).
    But other times we have **Categorical Outcomes**. *Logistic Regression solves
    the limitation of Linear Regression in which the outcome variable (***y***) must
    be continuous.*

- en: '**Logistic Regression** is a Regression technique that is used when we have
    a categorical outcome (2 or more categories). This technique can be used to analyze
    and predict variables that are ‘**Discrete**’, ‘**Nominal**’ and ‘**Ordered**’.
    Logistic Regression is one of the most easily interpretable classification techniques
    in a Data Scientist’s portfolio.'

- en: Unlike Linear Regression, Logistic Regression does not make any assumptions
    of Normality, Linearity and Homogenity of Variance. This is one of the reasons
    that Logistic Regression could be more powerful as these assumptions are rarely
    or if ever satisfied in the real world.

- en: An easy way to think of the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression
    is in Linear Regression, a person can predict a student’s test score (continuous
    target). In Logistic Regression, a person can assign ‘Pass’, ‘Fail’ categories
    to student’s scores and predict whether a student passed or failed.

- en: Logistic Regressions are some of the most simple but powerful techniques in
    Machine Learning. The different forms of Logistic Regression can be used to model
    many real world scenarios with a relatively easily interpretable outcome. This
    is not a black-box process which adds to its attractiveness to be used. Many believe
    Logistic Regression to be used only with binary outcomes but as we have seen it
    is not the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A great reason to gain a deep understanding of Logistic Regression is that it
    [helps to understand Neural Networks](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/43538/difference-between-logistic-regression-and-neural-networks).
    Machine Learning is at its core the method of computers making decisions and many
    decisions are categorical/discrete in nature. Learning Logistic Regression can
    be a segue to understanding Neural Networks.
