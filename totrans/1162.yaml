    to remove this confusion. But, I don’t have that kind of leverage in the industry

    the xgboost model I’m using is overall superior**, so it should be my starting
    model. Only to find out that a linear regression model performs with a few percentage
    points. And linear regression was used because it is more straightforward and
    more interpretable.
