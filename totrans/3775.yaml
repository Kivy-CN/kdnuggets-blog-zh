    Environment (IDE). It has everything that VSCode offers. The entire code editor
    is built for developers who want to get things done fast and accurately with the
    help of AI. The Cursor understands your code source and suggests more relevant
    results. It is better than GitHub Copilot and has many features you will immediately
    fall in love with. I have used Cursor for data science, machine learning, Python
    programming, and writing tutorials. It is my primary tool for code-related problems.'

- en: If you are getting started with data science or are an expert in the field,
    you must be using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for your everyday tasks.
    It is highly recommended by professionals for writing data reports, experimenting
    with Python code, building and testing machine learning models, and even deploying
    the notebook in production. It is simple and has tons of features, making data
    tasks easy. Now, Jupyter Notebook comes with an AI assistant, which will help
    you generate code and auto-complete.

    the best tool out there. You can run R notebooks just like Jupyter Notebooks but
    better, and it comes with amazing features that make it fun and easy to visualize
    the data and test various algorithms. RStudio is highly recommended for beginners
    if they have never touched any IDE in their lives. It is simple and comes with
    essential tools to make your life easy.

    let you use datasets, models, and Python packages shared by community members
    to work on the data science projects. It comes with free GPUs and TPUs computes
    and provides unlimited use of CPU computing. You can save your notebook, share
    it with others, and even participate in a competition to win a money prize. The
    main advantage of the Kaggle platform is its free access to Cloud Notebook, which
    makes it accessible for anyone with limited resources to get started with data
    science.

    AI tools and multiple data integration. It is similar to your local IDE where
    you can do almost anything: build apps, generate data reports, or experiment with
    multiple machine learning models. It is my second go-to tool for code-related
    and data-related tasks. It is easy to use and comes with amazing features that
    will make you a super data scientist. I am a big fan of this platform, and I would
    love for you to give it a try.'

    tasks, then you should take a look at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    It comes with free but limited access to GPUs and TPUs and provides free AI completion
    and generation tools for code generation. It is widely used by data professionals,
    and every new tool in the data space has a tutorial published on Google Colab.
    It is simple, fast, and comes with enough features for you to build and test data
    applications.

    have a look at[ Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/).
    It comes with 8 hours of free CPU and 4 hours of GPU computing daily and provides
    all the necessary tools that JupyterLab provides. It is fast and built for all
    kinds of machine learning deep learning tasks. You can use it to build the AI
    application that you dream of.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Choosing the right IDE is important as it will help you learn data science faster
    and help you navigate various issues that arise while learning data science and
    machine learning. If you want my suggestion, I would suggest you start with Kaggle
    notebooks. It comes with a pre-built environment, meaning you don’t have to set
    up anything, and it comes with thousands of datasets you can immediately start
    working on. It is completely free and comes with community integration. After
    mastering the programming language, I would like you to consider trying out other
    alternatives that work for you. Currently, Cursor works amazingly for me, but
    in the future, it might change based on my work requirements.
