    usually equipped with its in-memory data processing engine. This engine’s functionality
    includes ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load), machine learning, data analytics,
    batch processing, and stream processing of data.

    from Facebook AI Denis Yarats uses it: “*This tool is using the data flow/stream
    processing conception for distributed computing and allows for scaling solutions
    to large clusters.*”'

    defining their use cases and requirements. So much gelled for us in the preparation.
    We’re planning a post about [AI solutions in airlines](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/datascience/7-ways-how-airlines-use-artificial-intelligence-and-data-science-to-improve-their-operations/) next
    month. So, if you are an active machine learning practitioner, please feel free
    to share with us which tools you prefer in the comment section or by contacting
    us directly. We’d be glad to share your comments as well.
