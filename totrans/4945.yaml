- en: Download the Python 3.X version of the Anaconda distribution for your operating
    system [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). You will avoid a lot of install-related
    headaches by choosing this pre-bundled distribution. It comes with most of the
    important data analysis packages pre-installed.

- en: Once you have it installed, test to make sure that the default python interpreter
    is the one you’ve just installed. This is important because your system may already
    have a version of Python installed, but it won’t have all the good stuff in the
    Anaconda bundle, so you need to make sure the new one is the default. On Mac/Linux
    this might mean typing `which python` in the terminal. Or you can just run the
    Python interpreter and make sure the version matches what you downloaded. If all
    went well, it should have been done by the install. If not, you’ll need to stop
    here and fix it.

    window. If not, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888`. Once there,
    create a new Python notebook.

    filter to [Python kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels?language=Python). These
    are mostly jupyter notebooks of other people doing analysis or building models
    on data sets that are freely available on Kaggle’s website. Look for titles with
    things like EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), as opposed to those building predictive
    models. Find one that’s interesting and start recreating it in your notebook.

    you get import errors. This is likely because they’ve installed packages that
    are not bundled in the Anaconda distribution. You’ll eventually need to learn
    how to interact with the conda package manager and this will be one of many rabbit
    holes you’ll eventually go down. Usually it’s as easy as `conda install <package_name>` but
    you’ll need to find the right package name and sometimes you’ll need to specify
    other details. And other times you’ll need to use `pip install <other_package_name>`,
    but you’ll learn all that later.'

    the hood is calling C-compiled code, so is much faster than the same functions
    written in Python. Not the most user-friendly.'

    by default. Also has its own functionality, but I find the coolest stuff runs
    too slow.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Pandas: mostly a thin wrapper around NumPy/SciPy to make more user friendly.
    Ideal for interacting with tables of data, which they call a DataFrame. Also has
    wrappers around plotting functionality to enable quick plotting while avoiding
    complications of MPL. I use Pandas more than anything for manipulating data.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Scikit-learn: Has a lot of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
    Also has many metrics for doing model selection and a nice preprocessing library
    for doing things like Principal Component Analysis or encoding categorical variables.'

- en: When in a jupyter notebook, put a question mark in front of any object before
    running the cell and it will open up the documentation for it. This is really
    handy when you’ve forgotten the details of what the function you’re trying to
    call is expecting you to pass. e.g. `?my_dataframe.apply` will explain the `apply` method
    of the `pandas.DataFrame` object, represented here by `my_dataframe`.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will likely always need to refer to the documentation for whatever library
    you’re using, so just keep it open in your browser. There’s just too many optional
    arguments and nuances.

- en: Accept the fact that you’ll be doing things you don’t fully understand for awhile
    or you’ll get bogged down by details that aren’t that important. Some day you’ll
    probably need to understand virtual environments and it’s really not that hard,
    but there are many detours like that that add unnecessary pain for someone getting
    started.

- en: Read other people’s code. It’s the best way to learn conventions and best practices.
    That’s where the Kaggle kernels really help. GitHub also supports the display
    of jupyter notebooks in the browser, so there are tons of examples on the internet.
