    discussed repeatedly on many different platforms. So, what could I offer that
    hasn’t already been said?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, as it turns out, I’m a lot older than the average Medium author. Although
    some people politely refer to me as “mature” or “experienced,” the truth is that
    my perspective is shaped by the fact that I’ve been around long enough to remember
    when neon colors and gradients on bar-charts were cool. Therefore, what I can
    offer you is advice that stands the test of time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an analyst, you will probably spend at least 10 times as much time analyzing
    the data as you will have to present the information to your audience. Therefore,
    graphics and other visual representations are important because it creates a better
    understanding, even for those who aren’t trained in analyzing datasets. By building
    visualizations, you can help your company’s decision-makers understand complex
    ideas at a glance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do you improve this skill? Well, there are plenty of training options
    in the form of online courses and plenty of tools specializing in visualization.
    However, I’m hesitant to recommend specific technology or course because the world
    changes so quickly, and I want to offer advice that stands the test of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, make a habit of exploring other people’s work. Build a bookmarks
    folder called “Inspiration” and fill it with blog links. Dedicate 15 minutes weekly
    to browsing the blogs to fill your brain with possibilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also recommend buying a couple of books. Edward Tufte is the grandfather of
    data visualization, and I’m also a fan of Nathan Yau over at FlowingData.com,
    where you can find books, blogs, courses, and tutorials. I keep both of his books, *Data
    Points* and *Visualize This,* on my bookshelf for inspiration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mechanics of how you will actually create the visualization will come with
    practice. Some of you will fall in love with R or python, and others with Excel
    or Tableau. The key is having your brain filled with possibilities, so you can
    imagine what you want before you build it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Scientists are known for their claim that “80% of building a machine-learning
    model is preparing and cleaning the data.” However, this is also true for data
    analysts. Whatever the actual percentage, the truth is that a large proportion
    of time spent with data, in general, is spent cleaning it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cleaning data is important, because uncleaned data can produce misleading patterns
    and lead to mistaken conclusions. Early in my career, I was tasked with delivering
    the percentage of support calls that were resolved on the first try. As I walked
    my management through the results, one of them insisted that the numbers “didn’t
    make sense.” When I did more research, I discovered that the calls data had a
    column called “status” that sometimes was populated with an “X.” Apparently, the
    system would record an “X” for a test record, which should be ignored.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data cleaning skills grow with hands-on practice and business expertise. This
    makes it difficult to accelerate. In general, sites like [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [zindi](https://zindi.africa/) are
    not the best places to practice data cleaning because they are focused on data
    science, and the datasets are usually pretty clean already. On the other hand,
    government websites such as [https://data.ca.gov/](https://data.ca.gov/) or [https://data.gov/](https://data.gov/) are
    a great place to find datasets that are messy. You can also follow the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project,
    even if you’re not an R user, to find interesting datasets and get familiar with
    the types of cleaning steps that occur in the wild.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I mentioned, I am hesitant to recommend a specific tool or technology because
    of how quickly the landscape changes. It is probably safe to say that python and
    R are here to stay, but SQL is on another level. SQL is the language of databases;
    therefore, learning SQL will always be the most direct way you can manipulate
    and study datasets for your analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you work at a company that lets you download extracts in excel sheets — ask
    around to see if it’s possible to access the database directly with SQL. Once
    you are comfortable with database structures and writing SQL to get the data represented
    in the way you want, your efficiency will increase along with the quality of your
    work.
  prefs: []

    and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198) are
    great free resources for finding hands-on courses. [SQL Generator](https://app.rasgoml.com/sql) and [SQL
    Beautifier](https://codebeautify.org/sqlformatter) are great links to keep handy
    that will help you learn. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sql?tab=Active) has
    a great community for answering technical SQL questions if you get stuck.

- en: Here at Rasgo, we’ve been investing heavily in giving back to the data community.
    Our most recent project was the launch of our free [SQL Generator](https://app.rasgoml.com/sql) that
    generates the SQL syntax needed for specific data transformations. We found people
    were searching on Google and Stack Overflow for required SQL syntax — wasting
    a lot of time that could be used for data analysis. The SQL Generator is a template
    for a SQL query, which lets you customize column names and table structure, choose
    the operation that you want to do, and then it constructs the syntax for you in
    a variety of different “flavors” of SQL. Never stress about the subtle differences
    between DATEDIFF() vs. DATE_DIFF() again! Read [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-5-bookmarks-every-data-analyst-should-have-547a2c9ad1fe) from

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Critical thinking is one of the hardest things to grasp as there are not many
    courses or a one size fits all approach to mastering this skill. Critical thinking
    is a conscious effort to challenge the automatic mental processes that rule over
    us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Critical thinking isn’t something you naturally have or something that once
    you get it, it’s always “on.” Instead, critical thinking is something that you
    consciously activate whenever you have an important decision or analysis. It is
    a purposeful effort to challenge, question, and confirm hypotheses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While there are many different resources available to help you improve critical
    thinking skills, the one I want to focus on is asking questions. If you get into
    the habit of writing down lots of questions, you will engage in critical thinking.

    reasons why churn suddenly increased in the prior month. (it was currently April).
    I used critical thinking by writing down a list of questions similar to the above
    list.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL

    month of the year, which was called March, just simply because of how the math
    worked.

    you would not expect. It is also something that you can decide to improve upon
    today; it is not some mythical soft-skill that you need to be born with!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Communication on the other hand, *is* a soft skill. You might be the most talented
    and insightful data analyst the world has ever seen, but it won’t do any good
    if you can’t communicate with others. And by others, unfortunately, I mean non-technical
    people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an analyst, you straddle two different worlds. In one world, you must address
    technical points with your peers and other data experts. In the other world, you
    are a translator for business-centered decision-makers. You need to provide clear,
    high-level explanations in a supportive rather than confusing way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to start exercising this soft skill is to get involved in a community.
    There are many online communities, websites, and forums for data analysts to get
    involved in. I’m a big fan of slack and discord channels as a way to interact
    with others, but those are known to die off quickly. I have found [Locally Optimistic](https://locallyoptimistic.com/) and [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/) to
    be a good consistent place for analysts to hang out. You should also practice
    your communication skills by starting a blog. [Medium](https://medium.com/) is
    a great place to get started, where you can exercise your creativity and practice,
    practice, practice.

    make you marketable. For example, 20 years ago VBA, macros, DAX, and ASP were
    great skills to give you an edge towards promotion. These days, those skills are
    less likely to matter. Hopefully I’ve given you some helpful advice about skills
    that *haven’t* changed in the past 20 years, so you can avoid getting lost in
    the weeds. If you ever want to reach out to me and discuss the old days, you can
