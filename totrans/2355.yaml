- en: Cesar Hidalgo in his book, Why Information Grows, makes a very interesting observation
    – if you look at a city from above when an airline is about to land, it looks
    remarkably similar to a circuit board inside a computer (a CPU) zoomed in. A city
    is a computational unit, and so is any business. It can be abstracted as an algorithm
    – there is an input, some computation where we process that input, and there is
    an output.

- en: When it comes to a business, the computation is the product or service the business
    produces. For a barber, the raw material or input may be scissors, the rental
    space for the barbershop, mirrors, chairs, barricades, etc. the product is a haircut.
    Money in this case is the store of the value of that output. The higher the quality
    and/or quantity of output, the higher the value of the output is usually. There
    are exceptions to this – things like negative externalities of the combustion
    engine (which may be increasingly taxed by the government), and charities that
    produce effective goodwill. However, this stands as a general result.

    the business proposition. What is the input, what is the output?

    the problems in the business. What can improve the offering of the company, improve
    the price received by the company, or improve the procurement of raw materials,
    or any aspect of the logistics that starts from the input and ends in the output
    of the company?

    explained in a famous exercise in caution from WW2\. When the allied forces were
    looking to reinforce the planes for bombing raids – they looked at the frequency
    of bullet holes in the planes that returned. Most data scientists or operations
    research executives working at the time were of thought that they needed to reinforce
    the areas of the plane which had more bullet holes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One Hungarian-born mathematician, Abraham Wald, thought otherwise. He looked
    at reinforcing the parts of the plane which had no bullet holes. The reason being,
    that the aircraft that got hit in those areas, never really came back. They were
    downed.

    of the mechanics of the business, data doesn’t do much. It can lead to erroneous
    decisions in large businesses where solutions can be small in scale in terms of
    the quantum of improvement or efficiency they provide. In those cases, having
    a solid understanding of the business is critically important.

- en: Data gathering takes the form of speaking to lots of business stakeholders and
    getting to understand the data in the business. Data can hide very well in silos
    within the business and it’s the data scientist's job to get to a single source
    of truth, scour through the different data points provided to understand the data
    and choose the most relevant and appropriate parts for analysis. Not all data
    is required and part of the skill is to be able to discern what is important and
    what is not. To separate the signal from the noise. Adding data incrementally
    to an existing piece of analysis is always possible so is removing data sets.
    However, the key is to find a smaller number of variables that are important to
    solve the business need.

- en: Businesses in the end are money-making propositions in a capitalist framework.
    If the analysis does not provide a way to either save money or make money – it’s
    worthless. That is then not allowed at all. This is important and key to the whole
    proposition of data science. It should provide a key action point or direction
    to the management and/or stakeholders to create a monetary value add – either
    directly in terms of saving costs or making more profit or in “soft” terms such
    as marketing or CSR.

- en: The data scientist must also be a storyteller. As Steve Jobs said – “the most
    powerful person in the world is the storyteller”. To be able to communicate the
    value generated to the business is of huge importance. Unless stakeholders “see”
    the value – it's almost a moot point that the analysis creates value because they
    won’t be able to or willing to put it into action.
  prefs: []

- en: Storytelling the value proposition is therefore as important as creating the
    value. A data scientist must therefore be very good at communicating these insights.
