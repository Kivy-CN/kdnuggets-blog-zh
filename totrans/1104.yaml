    or earlier dreamt of doing it when they grew up. For me, I first wanted to be
    a veterinarian, then a park ranger, a dog trainer, a writer, and finally an economist.
    I still kind of want to acquire those last two job roles like some kids dream
    of being a lawyer-doctor-astronaut (or lawyer-doctor-mermaid, but let’s be realistic,
    mermaids are too fabulous to study something as dry as the law).

    data science from the University of Virginia in May. A few months after graduation,
    I landed my first full-time position as a data scientist. I was ecstatic to be
    able to put my skills to use and prove myself to my new peers. I’ve also felt
    in over my head about 426 times in the 135 days since I started.

    in it when given the choice. Nonetheless, I use a mix of Python and the terminal
    (in VS Code) for 95% of my tasks at work, SQL about 5% of the time, and R exactly
    0% since I started. As a result, the classes I took in R (about half the curriculum)
    have become exponentially less useful for me than those taken in Python. Many
    of the assignments too — such as web scraping, NLP, Apache Spark, or Tableau —
    I just haven’t employed at all. And that’s just par for the course, because it’s
    hard to guess what exactly you’ll do in the job you take.

    I’d recommend asking your recruiters early on what the team uses. Even if you
    could “technically” code in the language of your choosing, if the team uses something
    else it’s going to make code reviews and integrations that much harder. For me,
    I actually do enjoy getting better at Python, but if it had been in something
    else like Scala I don’t think I would have liked it as much.

- en: AWS and I had not been much more acquainted than a firm handshake when I began,
    but now I use it on a daily basis. AWS is also notoriously bloated with a million
    and one offerings that make it hard to know what service you need for a given
    task. To make matters worse, searching for how to do something in AWS will often
    point you to 5 services that all sound basically the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To combat this, I’ve been casually studying for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification
    using [ExamPro](https://www.exampro.co/). There’s just so much to learn, but as
    I go through it I find myself making connections and learning about services that
    might be handy to my job in the future. Eventually I’ll also take the exam, which
    will hopefully be a good resume-booster, too. I don’t think I’ll ever be an AWS
    wizard, but if I can become a relatively competent AWS paladin then I could live
    with that.

    which one you might use, I’d honestly still recommend AWS; TechJury.net found
    that AWS had a [76% share of new enterprise cloud adoption in 2020](https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-companies-use-cloud-computing/#gref).
    Nonetheless, most companies employ cloud services to some extent and its good
    to know the basics of how they work and what they offer.

    high-level problem. At companies with smaller data science teams, you’re often
    going to be the one muddling through the real, messy, ugly data yourself. If its
    big data, trying to mold it to run in your pipeline can feel like trying to fit
    a rhino into your mother’s old prom dress.

    difference. For data that’s having trouble processing, I use commands such as `watch
    -d -n 0.5 nvidia-smi` and `htop` to track things like GPU/CPU usage and memory,
    and `df -h` to monitor the size of files in a given directory in case I overrun
    on space. I also use tmux sessions in order to have multiple terminal windows
    open at once and to keep my work from disconnecting when ssh’ed into a remote
    machine. Finally, when I find a solution that works, I’ll still look online for
    an alternative with better *O(n) *complexity, which can save minutes to days of
    processing time when working with big datasets.

    relentless. The tasks you will be asked to do are going to feel completely out
    of left field a lot of the time, which means you’re scrambling to figure out a
    solution in the moment and solve bugs you didn’t even know existed. You’ll learn
    to navigate the inner complexities of the most random things on a daily basis,
    and while you won’t necessarily map A → C → Q ever again, you *will* start getting
    better at programming and the codebase will start making more sense with every
    iteration.

    pretty much the same thing. For me at least, I feel like I’m learning at least

    a surprise (after all, I was *paying* someone to teach me things there).

- en: This isn’t data science-specific, but I put a lot of pressure on myself while
    in school and didn’t let loose as often as my peers did (although I lived on frat
    row, so that could also be why ????). I’d study for the entire week (or sometimes
    month — calculus is hard) before a midterm, barely leaving my room except to print
    out more practice tests or refill my coffee. On non-midterm weeks I’d push myself
    to study late into the mornings, then jostle myself awake, throw on sweatpants,
    sandals, and an old pullover and hustle over to the 8 or 9am I had that day. From
    the amount I *didn’t *get out, I’m surprised I didn’t scare everyone at graduation
    by looking like a gangly, pale vampire.

    journal, read, meditate, exercise, and probably eat acai-kombucha-avocado-bowls
    before the clock even struck 7:30\. Also, work wouldn’t feel like work because
    I love coding and therefore everything in my life would be amazing all the time

    remotely (like I do) and don’t need to turn your camera on a lot, then sweatpants,
    raggedy sweatshirts, and slept-on hair are also fair game. So basically college….without
    the friends or darties blasting *Mr. Brightside* outside your window.

    like you’re living in the twilight zone when you’re working until 1am without
    any other reason than “I think I’m close to fixing this bug!”, only to wake up
    a few minutes before a meeting the next day and repeat the cycle all over again.
    Be kind to yourself — burnout is bad and balance is the key, something of which
    I’m still learning.

    10 years, because companies will always want information to increase profits —
    i.e. data — and people to analyze it quantitatively — i.e. data scientists (or
    engineers, or analysts, the name doesn’t really matter). In my job, I’ve already
    been able to directly impact big initiatives and make a positive difference with
    my data science, projects of which will live on for many years more after I’ve
    left them.

    I could start my own ventures or retire early if I so chose. With data science,
    there isn’t as much of the typical trade-off of doing something impactful *and* being
    financially well-off; **you can be both without compromise**. Combined with the
    fact that programming is fun, data science really is the perfect trifecta.
