    to various challenges arising in manufacturing self-driving cars. With the incorporation
    of sensor data processing in an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) in a car, it is
    essential to enhance the utilization of machine learning to accomplish new tasks.
    The potential applications include evaluation of driver condition or driving scenario
    classification through data fusion from different external and internal sensors
    – like lidar, radars, cameras or the IoT (Internet of Things).

    from sensor data fusion systems and for example, have the capability to direct
    the car to a hospital if it notices that something is not right with the driver.
    This application based on machine learning also includes the driver’s speech and
    gesture recognition and language translation. The algorithms are classified as
    an unsupervised and supervised algorithms. The difference between both of them
    is how they learn.

    to learn till they get to the level of confidence they aspire for (the minimization
    of the probability of error). The supervised algorithms can be sub-categorized
    into regression, classification and anomaly detection or dimension reduction.

    implies, within the available data, an algorithm develops a relation in order
    to detect the patterns or divides the data set into subgroups depending on the
    level of similarity between them. The Unsupervised algorithms can be largely sub-categorized
    into association rule learning and clustering.

    which fall between unsupervised and supervised learning. For each training example,
    there is a target label in supervised learning; there are no labels at all in
    unsupervised learning; the reinforcement learning consists of time-delayed and
    sparse labels – the future rewards.

    the limitations and merits of an algorithm and to develop efficient learning algorithms
    is the goal in reinforcement learning. The reinforcement learning potentially
    addresses a huge number of practical applications that range from problems in
    AI to the control engineering or operations research – all that are relevant for
    the development of a self-driving car. This can be categorized as indirect learning
    and direct learning.

- en: The decision matrix algorithm systematically analyzes, identifies and rates
    the performance of relationships between the sets of information and values. These
    algorithms are majorly utilized for decision making. Whether a car needs to brake
    or take a left turn is based on the level of confidence these algorithms have
    on recognition, classification and prediction of the next movement of objects.
    The decision matrix algorithms are models composed of various decision models
    trained independently and in some way, these predictions are combined to make
    the overall prediction, while decreasing the possibility of errors in decision
    making. AdaBoosting is the most commonly used algorithm.

- en: Adaptive Boosting or AdaBoost is a combination of multiple learning algorithms
    that can be utilized for regression or classification. It overcomes overfitting
    when compared with any other machine learning algorithms and is often sensitive
    to outliers and noisy data. In order to create one composite powerful learner,
    AdaBoost uses multiple iterations. So, it is termed as adaptive. By adding the
    weak learners iteratively, AdaBoost creates a strong learner. A new weak learner
    is appended to the entity and a weighing vector is adjusted in order to pay attention
    on examples that were classified incorrectly in the prior rounds. A classifier
    that has much higher accuracy than the classifiers of weak learners is the result.

    The above image depicts the implementation of AdaBoost in one single file with
    understandable code. The function contains a weak classifier and the boosting
    component. The weak classifier attempts to locate the ideal threshold in one of
    data dimensions to segregate the data into 2 classes. The classifier is called
    by the boosting part iteratively and after each classification step, it changes
    the weights of misclassified examples. Because of this, a cascade of weak classifiers
    is created and it behaves like a strong classifier.

    to locate and detect objects. Sometimes, there is a possibility of classification
    algorithms missing the object and in that case, they fail to categorize and report
    it to the system. The possible reason could be discontinuous data, very few data
    points or low-resolution images. The clustering algorithm is specialized in discovering
    the structure from data points. It describes the class of methods and class of
    problem like regression. The clustering methods are organized typically by modeling
    the approaches like hierarchical and centroid-based. All methods are concerned
    with utilizing the inherent structures in data to organize the data perfectly
    into groups of maximal commonality. K-means, Multi-class Neural Network is the
    most commonly used algorithm.

    if it is closer to the centroid of that cluster than any other centroid. By alternating
    between choosing the centroids depending on the current assignment of data points
    to clusters and assigning the data points to clusters depending on current centroids.

    to determine the instances of an object category by ruling out the data points

    polylines (fitting line segments) of an object as well as circular arcs to edges.
    Till a corner, the line segments are aligned with the edges and a new line segment
    will begin after this. The circular arcs align with the line segments’ sequences
    that is similar to an arc. In various ways, the features of the image (circular
    arcs and line segments) are combined to form the features that are utilized for
    determining an object.

    RED or GREEN class. A boundary line of separation separates the RED and GREEN
    objects. Any new object that falls to the left is labeled as RED and it is labeled

    an image and that image. The statistical model, by allowing the image sampling,
    provides fast online detection and can be learned offline. It can be extended
    furthermore to other objects without the requirement of extensive human modeling.

    layer of the network. Into every node of last hidden layer, many x’s will be fed
    and every x will be multiplied by w, a corresponding weight. To a bias, the products’
    sum is added and moved to an activation function. An activation function is a
    ReLU (rectified linear unit), used commonly as it does not saturate on the shallow
    gradients like the sigmoid activation functions do. ReLU provides an output, activation
    a for each hidden node and the activations are added going into output node which
    passes the sum of activations. This implies, a neural network that performs regression
    contains single output node and this node will multiply the sum of activations
    of previous layer by 1\. The network’s estimate, ‘y hat’ will be the result. ‘Y
    hat’ is the dependent variable that all the x’s map to. You can use the neural
    network in this way to obtain the function relating x(number of independent variables)
    to y (a dependent variable) that you are trying to predict.
