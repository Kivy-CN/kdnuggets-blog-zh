- en: A recent article by Mikhail Mew, [Data Scientists Will be Extinct in 10 Years](/2021/06/data-scientists-extinct-10-years.html),
    argues that the role of the data scientist, as we know it, will disappear in roughly
    a decade. In its place, we will find "data savvy business specialists and subject
    matter experts who are able to imbue analysis with their deep domain knowledge,
    irrespective of whether they can code or not."

    takes an opposing view, expressing his frustration in statements endorsing the
    imminent implosion of the field of data science. "If there is one field where
    you have the best chance of truly retiring in, it is data science," he states,
    unequivocally.
