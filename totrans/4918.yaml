- en: Below is a ranking of 23 open-source deep learning libraries that are useful
    for Data Science, based on Github and Stack Overflow activity, as well as Google
    search results. The table shows standardized scores, where a value of 1 means
    one standard deviation above average (average = score of 0). For example, Caffe
    is one standard deviation above average in Github activity, while deeplearning4j
    is close to average. See below for methods.

    and forks), Stack Overflow (tags and questions), and Google Results (total and
    quarterly growth rate). These were obtained using available APIs. Coming up with
    a comprehensive list of deep learning toolkits was tricky - in the end, we scraped
    five different lists that we thought were representative (see methods below for
    details). Computing standardized scores for each metric allows us to see which
    packages stand out in each category. The [full ranking is here](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/output/DL_libraries_final_Rankings.csv),
    while the [raw data is here](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/output/deep_learning_data.csv).'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TensorFlow is at least two standard deviations above the mean on all calculated
    metrics. TensorFlow has almost three times as many Github forks and more than
    six times as many Stack Overflow questions than the second most popular framework,
    Caffe. First open-sourced by the Google Brain team in 2015, TensorFlow has climbed
    over more senior libraries such as Theano (4) and Torch (8) for the top spot on
    our list. While TensorFlow is distributed with a Python API running on a C++ engine,
    several of the libraries on our list can utilize TensorFlow as a back-end and
    offer their own interfaces. These include Keras (2), which will [soon be part
    of core TensorFlow](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/820746845068505088) and
    Sonnet (6). The popularity of TensorFlow is likely due to a combination of its
    general-purpose deep learning framework, flexible interface, good-looking computational
    graph visualizations, and Google’s significant developer and community resources.

- en: '**Caffe has yet to be replaced by Caffe2**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Caffe takes a strong third place on our list with more Github activity than
    all of its competitors (excluding TensorFlow). Caffe is traditionally thought
    of as more specialized than Tensorflow and was developed with a focus on image
    processing, objection recognition, and pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
    Facebook released Caffe2 (11) in April 2017, and it already ranks in the top half
    the deep learning libraries. Caffe2 is a more lightweight, modular, and scalable
    version of Caffe that includes recurrent neural networks. Caffe and Caffe2 are
    separate repos, so data scientists can continue to use the original Caffe. However,
    there are migration tools such as [Caffe Translator](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/blob/master/caffe2/python/caffe_translator.py)
    that provide a means of using Caffe2 to drive existing Caffe models.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keras (2) is highest ranked non-framework library. Keras can be used as a front-end
    for TensorFlow (1), Theano (4), MXNet (7), CNTK (9), or deeplearning4j (14). Keras
    performed better than average on all three metrics measured. The popularity of
    Keras is likely due to its simplicity and ease-of-use. Keras allows for fast prototyping
    at the cost of some of the flexibility and control that comes from working directly
    with a framework. Keras is favorited by data scientists experimenting with deep
    learning on their data sets. The development and popularity of Keras continues
    with R Studio recently releasing [an interface](https://keras.rstudio.com/) in
    R for Keras.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a sea of new deep learning frameworks, Theano (4) has the distinction of
    the oldest library in our rankings. Theano pioneered the use of the computational
    graph and remains popular in the research community for deep learning and machine
    learning in general. Theano is essentially a numerical computation library for
    Python, but can be used with high-level deep learning wrappers like Lasagne (15).
    While Google supports TensorFlow (1) and Keras (2), Facebook backs PyTorch (5)
    and Caffe2 (11), MXNet (7) is the official deep learning framework of Amazon Web
    Services, and Microsoft designed and maintains CNTK (9), Theano remains popular
    without official support from a technology industry giant.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Early in 2017 Google's DeepMind publicly released the code for Sonnet (6), a
    high-level object oriented library built on top of TensorFlow. The number of pages
    returned in Google search results for Sonnet has grown by 272% from this quarter
    compared to the last, the largest of all the libraries we ranked. Although Google
    acquired the British artificial intelligence company in 2014, DeepMind and Google
    Brain have remained mostly independent teams. DeepMind has a focus on artificial
    general intelligence and Sonnet can help a user build on top of their specific
    AI ideas and research.

    growing library on our list. Compared to last quarter, PyTorch had 236% more Google
    search results. Out of the 23 open-source deep learning frameworks and wrappers
    we ranked, only three did not have interfaces in Python: Dlib (10), MatConvNet
    (20), and OpenNN (23). C++ and R interfaces were available in just seven and six
    of the 23 libraries, respectively. While the data science community is somewhat
    close to a consensus when it comes to using Python, there are still many options
    for deep learning libraries.'
