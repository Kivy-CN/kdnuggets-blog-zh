    speak about hard skills when it comes to being a data scientist. Companies will
    list out different tools and software that they would like you to know, but when
    you’re at your interview it is how you perceive yourself that matters the most.

    very annoying - but it matters. Especially when you’re working in a technical
    field, it is very important to be able to communicate these technical concepts
    to non-technical stakeholders. Reminding yourself that not everybody is technically
    inclined and you will need to ensure you have effective communication to explain
    valuable insights, findings from your analysis and data-driven decisions.

    creating an application, a report, etc.'

    like, you will be able to understand how much time each phase requires. You can

    method and process for the data science project lifecycle in place requires teamwork.
    As a student data scientist, you will be the sole person working on the project.
    Once you start with a company, these tasks can be split up between the data science
    team. Not only does it effectively take workload off your shoulders, but it gives
    everybody on the team to experience the tasks included.

    communicate with your team members about what you are doing, if you’re blocked
