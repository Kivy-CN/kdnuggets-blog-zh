    of statistics in the sector. Statistics help Data Scientists to collect, analyze,
    and interpret the data by identifying patterns and trends, to then make future
    predictions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A statistical paradox is when a statistical result contradicts expectations.
    It can be very difficult to pinpoint the exact cause, as it is hard to understand
    the data without the use of further methods. However, they are an important element
    for Data Scientists as it gives them a lead on what could possibly be causing
    the misleading results.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Berkson-Jekel paradox is when two variables are correlated in data, however,
    when the data is grouped or subsetted, the correlation is not identified. To put
    it in layman's terms, the correlation is different in different subgroups of the
    data.

- en: The Berkson-Jekel paradox is named after the first statisticians who described
    the paradox, Joseph Berkson and John Jekel. The discovery of the Berkson-Jekel
    paradox is when the two statisticians were studying the correlation between smoking
    and lung cancer. During their study, they found a correlation between people who
    had been hospitalized for pneumonia and lung cancer, in comparison to the general
    population. However, they conducted further research which showed that the correlation
    was due to smokers being hospitalized for pneumonia more, in comparison to people
    who did not smoke.

    may say that more research was required to figure out the exact reasoning behind
    the correlation. However, there are also other reasons why the Berkson-Jekel paradox
    occurs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statistical reasoning is very important in Data Science, and the main issue
    is dealing with misleading results. As a data scientist, you want to ensure that
    you are producing accurate results that can be used in the decision-making process
    and for future predictions. Making incorrect predictions or misleading results
    is the last thing on the cards.

    of sources. This will help you to get a more representative sample of the population,
    research more on the variables, and get a better understanding.

    data professionals need to understand the limitations of the data they’re working
    with, different variables and the relationship between them, and how to reduce
    misleading results from happening.
