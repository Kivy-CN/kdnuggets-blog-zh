- en: This post is made up of a collection of 10 Github repositories consisting in
    part, or in whole, of IPython (Jupyter) Notebooks, focused on transferring data
    science and machine learning concepts. They go from introductory Python material
    to deep learning with TensorFlow and Theano, and hit a lot of stops in between.

    of languages, but this list is old school, and is straight IPython Notebook style
    material.

    who uses the common Python ecosystem data analysis/machine learning/data science
    stack to work with the [Iris dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).
    It's a single notebook, but it's a good notebook to start with, as it whets your
    appetite for all tools analytic, including visualization. It also gets you focused
    on telling stories with data.

    but I highly recommend this book. The repository is also fantastic, and a great
    resource unto itself. However, you would be well-advised to splurge and grab a
    copy of your own to fully understand the contents of the repo, and to fully embrace
    machine learning in the Python ecosystem.

    is aimed at teaching [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) in the context
    of several different machine learning algorithms. Validation, Density Estimation
    with Gaussian Mixture Models, and Dimensionality Reduction with PCA are a few
    of the more interesting topics covered; you also get standards like k-Means, Regression,
    and Classification, don't worry. The material is likely best-suited to a beginner
    in machine learning, or someone with some understanding looking to master Scikit-learn.

    (it's from way back in Fall 2013) covers a wide range of material, with an apparent
    focus on Linux command line-powered data management. A number of the common libraries
    are covered, as well as shell programming and Linux command line basics, and at
    least one then-current paper was implemented using the Python stack. It also seems
    to tackle a few Kaggle competitions, so you get a little bit of a lot with this
    one.

    includes some introductory Python material, as well as more advanced topics like
    Autoencoders. It also links to a number of related materials.
