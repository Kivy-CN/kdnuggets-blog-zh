    project-based learning, reviews, and ratings. I used thousands of course ratings
    and reviews from [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) and [CourseTalk](https://www.coursetalk.com/),
    along with the respective institution’s ratings and reviews, to help me make my
    decisions. I selected the best computer science, math, data science, AI, and machine
    learning courses I could find based on this.

    what’s needed to succeed.

    the foundation for ML and AI (and I love math!), so I included a few courses that
