    your data science projects. Before delving into some tips for data science project
    management, let’s first discuss why it is important to organize your project.

    placed in one directory, it makes it easier to avoid wasting time searching for
    project files such as datasets, codes, output files, and so on.

    you have to solve a similar problem in the future, you can use the same code with

    we would like to build a machine learning model for recommending cruise ship crew
    size based on predictor variables such as age, tonnage, passengers, length, cabins,
    etc. In section I, we describe how the project should be organized locally. Then
    in section I, we describe how to create a Github repository for the project. It
    is always recommended that you maintain two versions of your project, one locally
    and the other on Github. The advantage of this is that you can access the Github
    version of your project from anywhere in the world and at any time, as long as
    you have an internet connection. Another advantage is that if something were to
    happen with your local computer that could impact your computer adversely, such
    as viruses in the computer, then you can always be confident that you still have
    your project files on Github that can serve as a backup.

    name that reflects your project, for example, for the machine learning model for
    recommending crew size, one may choose a directory name such as *ML_Model_for_Predicting_Ships_Crew_Size.*

    by step by step plan of what you would like to accomplish. For example, before
    building a model, you may ask yourself:'

    are, it is time to start coding. Depending on the type of problem you are solving,
    you may decide to use a jupyter notebook or an R script for writing your code.
    Let’s just assume we are going to be using a jupyter notebook.

    directory. Some key project outputs could be data visualizations, graphs illustrating
    model error as a function of different parameters, or tables containing key outputs
    such as R2 values, mean square errors, or regression coefficients. Project outputs
    are very handy because they can be used to prepare project reports or PowerPoint
    presentation slides to be presented to your data science team or to the business
    administrators in your company.

- en: '(5) **Project report**: In some cases, you may have to put together a project
    report to describe project accomplishments and provide prescribed actions to be
    taken based on the findings and insights from your model. In this case, you need
    to put together a project report using MS word. When writing a project report,
    you can make good use of some visualizations produced from your main code. You
    want to add these to the report. Your main code may be added as an appendix to
    the project report.'

    repository on GitHub and upload project files such as datasets, jupyter notebooks,
    R program scripts, and sample outputs. Creating a GitHub repository for any data
    science project is extremely important. It enables you to have access to your
    code at all times. You get to share your code with a community of programmers
    and other data scientists. Also, it is a means for you to showcase your data science
    skills.

    Good organization leads to better productivity and efficiency. When next you have
    to work on a new project, please take the time to organize your project. This
    will not only help with increasing efficiency and productivity, but it will also
    help to minimize errors. Also, keeping good records of all your current and completed
    projects enables you to create a repository where you can save all your projects
    for future use.
