- en: According to PayScale, the [average salary for a data scientist](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Data_Scientist_%2F_Engineer/Salary)
    is $92,949\. It drops to $88,973 for an entry-level position. Hopefully, you've
    already researched the wages for data scientists with experience comparable to
    yours before starting the job search. If not, now is the time to get those numbers
    and see how they stack up to your job offer.

- en: Consider things like the cost of living, too, especially if the job requires
    you to move somewhere new. Moreover, evaluate whether you will have to endure
    a significant commute to get to work each day. Are public transit routes available?
    Answering those questions could help you determine whether the salary offered
    will help you have a comfortable lifestyle.

    worth to you?" Even if it comes across as a casual question, it could be an attempt
    to see whether you'd accept a low figure.

    when looking at what a data science company offers its employees. [Label Insight](https://www.labelinsight.com/)
    is a company that uses data science to bring more transparency to food labels.
    It also provides [excellent benefits for team members](https://www.builtinchicago.org/2017/03/09/tech-companies-great-perks),
    including unlimited vacation days, a dog-friendly workplace and a stocked kitchen,
    plus more conventional advantages like subsidized health insurance.

- en: Think about the things that would make a data science company an ideal place
    for you to work, and assess how the enterprise that offered the job matches those
    preferences. Maybe you'd love the ability to work from home one day a week or
    would appreciate if the company frequently pays for its workers to attend data
    science conferences and classes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a company doesn't offer most or at least several of the benefits you want,
    that's not necessarily a reason to turn down the offer, but it could give you
    matters to negotiate. For example, the business may not have a remote working
    policy in place for all its employees, but perhaps your role is more suited than
    most for working independently.

- en: '[Pennsylvania is an at-will state](https://www.weisbergcummings.com/review-contract-before-accepting-new-job/),
    along with Virginia, Texas and 11 other states. What that means if you live in
    one of those states is if a contract identifies as an at-will employee, your employer
    can fire you for any reason — or no reason. Look for a clause that states your
    data science contract may end at any time, and think carefully about accepting
    the job if you see one.'

    with competitors. But, they often don't have concrete plans for how they'll use
    data science or how data could help them solve specific problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a case like that, imagine the distress you'll experience if you're under
    the impression the contract will last for at least three years, but an at-will
    clause allows the employer to terminate you, and they do because their data science
    expectations haven't come to pass. That likely happened because of inadequate
    resources, not a failure on your part. But, an at-will clause could still cause
    you to lose your job.

    But, you should still look closely at the job offer and ensure everything is as
    you expected. While looking at the job specifics, you might notice some red flags.
    For example, maybe the contract says you'll be the sole person involved in data
    science at the company.

    start [an advanced analytics program](https://www.eweek.com/big-data-and-analytics/10-red-flags-warning-that-your-advanced-analytics-program-will-fail),
    but the contract says you're the team leader for that endeavor and will only direct
    two other people. In that case, the task may be too big to tackle, and you should
    look elsewhere for a job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An ideal job should challenge you, but not make you feel as if you're continually
    trying to reach impossible expectations. Even if you graduated at the top of your
    data science class or have several years of experience under your belt, you won't
    be able to thrive if the resources available don't align with the duties the job
    requires.

    Moreover, examine the contract to see what happens if you work overtime hours.

    to receive overtime, you'll receive your base rate of pay plus 50% — often called
    time-and-a-half. However, [not all workers can get](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/overtime-pay-rights-employee-30142.html)
    overtime pay. Working as a data science freelancer or earning more than a certain
    amount per hour could mean overtime pay is not an option for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your data science role may require working outside your usual hours from time
    to time, such as to finish up a project that has a tight deadline. But, if you
    don't get overtime for doing it, think about the possibility that you may end
    up resenting what seemed like a dream job because you work too hard for the pay.

    approach to take is to ask for time to look it over and review the factors above
    and others that matter to you. Showing caution like that helps you determine if
    the job is a good fit for you.
