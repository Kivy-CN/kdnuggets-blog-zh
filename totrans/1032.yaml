    The [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492045527/ref=emc_bcc_2_i)
    has made me think outside the box about deep neural networks and how we approach
    almost any machine learning issue. I am in love with NLP books and how they come
    with GitHub repositories, Jupyter notebooks exercise, and easy to explore options.
    [Data Science at the Command Line](https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/)
    is one of the books that are now available online (documentation style) with the
    ability to search terms, navigation, and copy the code directly to test the example.
    It provides an interactive reading experience for free.
