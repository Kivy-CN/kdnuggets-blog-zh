    the difficulties of building intelligent machines. I''ll use an analogy: making
    progress in research is like driving a car to a destination. When we find a new
    paradigm or a new set of techniques, it feels like we are driving a car on a highway
    and nothing can stop us until we reach the destination. ![Self-Driving Car](../Images/731890c72cb3cc801426748a40a0604c.png)'

  zh: 这需要多长时间？AI研究人员在低估构建智能机器的难度方面有很长的历史。我将用一个类比来说明：在研究中取得进展就像开车去一个目的地。当我们找到一个新的范式或一套新技术时，感觉就像我们在高速公路上开车，直到到达目的地，没有什么能阻止我们。
    ![自驾车](../Images/731890c72cb3cc801426748a40a0604c.png)
- en: But the reality is that we are really driving in a thick fog and we don't realize
    that our highway is really a parking lot with a brick wall at the far end. Many
    smart people have made that mistake, and every new wave in AI was followed by
    a period of unbounded optimism, irrational hype, and a backlash. It happened with
    "perceptrons", "rule-based systems", "neural nets", "graphical models", "SVM",
    and may happen with "deep learning", until we find something else. But these paradigms
    were never complete failures. They all left new tools, new concepts, and new algorithms.

  zh: 但现实是，我们实际上在浓雾中行驶，没意识到我们的高速公路实际上是一处停车场，远端有一堵砖墙。许多聪明的人犯过这个错误，每一次AI的新浪潮后，都会跟随一段过度乐观、非理性炒作和反弹期。这种情况发生在“感知机”、“基于规则的系统”、“神经网络”、“图模型”、“支持向量机”等领域，也可能发生在“深度学习”上，直到我们找到其他东西。但这些范式从未完全失败。它们都留下了新的工具、新的概念和新的算法。
- en: '![Sigmoid Curve](../Images/f3e117f2e2e78592d9c369d51c80c8f7.png)Although I
    do believe we will eventually build machines that will rival humans in intelligence,
    I don''t really believe in the singularity. We feel like we are on an exponentially
    growing curve of progress. But we could just as well be on a sigmoid curve. Sigmoids
    very much feel like exponentials at first. Also, the singularity assumes more
    than an exponential, it assumes an asymptote. The difference between dynamic evolutions
    that follow linear, quadratic, exponential, asymptotic, or sigmoidal shapes are
    damping or friction factors. Futurists seem to assume that there will be no such
    damping or friction terms. Futurists have an incentive to make bold predictions,
    particularly when they really want them to be true, perhaps in the hope that they
    will be self-fulfilling.'
