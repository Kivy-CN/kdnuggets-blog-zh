- en: Analytics products and systems are best built by small teams of generalists.
    Large teams of specialists become dominated by [communication overhead](https://personalmba.com/communication-overhead/),
    and the effect of [“Chinese whispers”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers)
    distorts the flow of tasks and stagnates creativity. Data scientists should develop
    generalist skills to become more efficient members of a data science team.

    From the customer representative at one end, to the operations engineer at the
    other, the spectrum of roles in a product analytics team looks like this:'

    person team like the one below. The problem with this setup is that it becomes
    much more difficult to achieve consensus and to perform any task that spans roles.
    And in data science, most tasks span roles.

- en: To look at a particular example, lets focus on the creation of a chart as part
    of a data product. To begin, a product manager creates a specification, then an
    interaction designer mocks up the chart, handing it off to a data scientist to
    fill with data (and hopefully to explore the data and find a chart worth producing),
    then a back-end engineer to setup an API to grab that data, a front-end web developer
    to create a web page using the data that matches the mock, and an experience designer
    to ensure the entire thing feels right and makes sense.

    for each chart. You can see how communication overhead starts to predominate.
    A meeting of six people is a full-blown, formal meeting. It is hard to get things
    done in formal meetings.

    generalists: a data engineer, a data scientist/back-end developer, a designer
    who can build front ends and a product manager that can write marketing copy and
    cut deals. This is how a startup team would span the skill spectrum, and you can
    probably see how this makes them more efficient.'

    the product manager, a designer who codes, and a data scientist. This is the kind
    of ad hoc meeting of 2–3 people where “shit gets done” efficiently. This group
    will be more efficient than the six man group. Put another way: this small team
    will kick the large team’s ass.'

- en: In the big company system, sometimes the only way to get anything done efficiently
    is to go “guerilla generalist” and work with other generalists to cut people out
    of the chain. This is bad politically, and is part of what drives effective people
    from big companies.

- en: We’ve shown that small teams generalists outperform large teams of specialists.
    In fact, generalist skills are something every data scientists should work to
    develop. That doesn’t mean you can’t specialize, but should combine specialization
    with generalization in order to develop “[T-shaped skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).”
    The T-shaped employee is one that can lend deep expertise across projects while
    fulfilling multiple roles in his own.

    a data scientist is not a six month bootcamp, but a ten year journey. Along this
    path, remember to try to be T-Shaped!
