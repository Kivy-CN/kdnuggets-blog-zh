  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Baby AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) is a python script which
    uses [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) APIs,
    and the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) framework
    to create, organize, prioritize as well as the executing of tasks. The process
    behind Baby AGI is that it will create a task using predefined objectives that
    are based on the outcome out a previous task.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is achieved by using OpenAI’s natural language processing (NLP) capabilities,
    which allows the system to create new tasks based on objectives. It uses Pinecone
    to store the results of that specific task and retrieve context, and the LangChain
    framework to handle the decision making process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you put out an objective to the system and the system will continuously
    prioritize the tasks that need to be achieved or completed in order to meet the
    objective. Once these tasks are completed, they will be stored in the memory.

    to reprioritize the task list. The function takes one parameter which is the ID
    of the current task. It will then send a prompt to OpenAI's API and return the
    new task list which has been reprioritized as a numbered list.

    three agents we discussed: execution, creation and prioritization.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You start off the task based on the objective that you have, and then move onto
    the query which takes context from the memory. This then sends it to the creation
    agent, which takes the data and sends it to the memory. It will then go through
    a queue which goes through the prioritization of tasks.

- en: Baby AGI has the ability to complete tasks, generate new tasks based on previous
    results, and prioritize tasks in real-time. This system is exploring and demonstrating
    to us the potential of large language models, such as GPT and how it can autonomously
    perform tasks.

    to continuously run. This can result in high API usage, memory and funding. Monitoring
    the system's behavior as well as ensuring the application is effective is important.
