    there are plenty of openings available, and the industry only appears to be growing

    to an industry data science professional. I exposed myself to all the tutorials,
    blogs, and MOOC’s that I could. I immersed myself in industry news and trends.
    I filled my bucket to the brim and found that the more I learned the more I realized
    I didn’t know. I was stressed, lacked confidence in what skills I had, and felt
    like an imposter going on data science interviews hoping I wasn’t going to be
    met with a “gotcha” because I didn’t spend enough time on loss functions.

    of exposure would lead me to my purpose, and a better paycheck. What I didn’t
    realize at the time was that I had put the cart before the horse. I was so eager
    to learn that I spent all my time learning lots of “things” without ever stopping
    to ask myself; How do all of these “things” come together to solve real problems?

    data science “things.” Most businesses only care about whether those things can
    solve business problems. So herein lies the rub, trying to learn all the tools
    of data science so your resume can be filled with an ever-expanding list of “things”
    (Python, R, regression, random forest, Naïve Bayes, Markov Chains, support vector
    machines, k-means clustering, XGBoost, convolutional neural nets, natural language
    processing, blah, blah, blah) is futile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These “things” will not lead you to your purpose because your purpose is only
    defined by where you feel valued. Where you will feel valued is where you allow
    your ever evolving knowledge of data science to be applied to solve problems.
    Being able to communicate how you leveraged *some* of the tools of data science
    to solve a problem, will take you much further in business than simply listing
    all the algorithms you have been exposed to in one class or another.

    lie? What problems do you want to solve? Once you have a list, pick something,
    and consider how your data science knowledge might be applied to solve a problem
    related to that interest.

    Creative problem solving is seeing how our understanding of two or more disparate
    fields can be combined in novel ways. If we are steeped in only learning data
    science in the context of our “canned” data sets and dispassionately assigned
    problems we are no longer able to bridge our depth of knowledge from multiple
    fields.

    data science solutions for solving the same problem. In other words, it is rare
    that there is right and wrong in data science and far more common that business
    problems can be solved in a myriad of ways. Are some solutions better than others?
    Sure. But this doesn’t mean that those that are less optimal are wrong, rather
    they are just not as good. With enough money and time, there is always a “better”
    solution so best not to get too caught up with that spiral. Instead, focus on
    how the knowledge you have can bring more value than what was there before or
    adds to existing solutions by revealing new insights not apparent in others.

    not taught in most data science courses, but they are problems that enterprise
    data scientists face every day. Take for example the simple problem of finding
    the right data. Most data science courses don’t teach you the value of data discovery
    but in the enterprise data scientists are often charged with discovering and blending
    with new data sets to further realize the value of both the data collected and
    the data scientist hired to value it. Learning data science with a purpose first
    will force you to look for ways to acquire the data most relevant to your problem,
    it will require you to access, wrangle, and engineer that data so that it is amenable
    for training with machine learning models.

    science to inform generating insights that expose injustice, that provide solutions
    for positive social change, and that help us to realize the implications of human

    third shift workers to support safer parking decisions. I had to locate local
    public police reporting data and blend it with other data sources such as Census
    data. Using what data science knowledge I had, I new I could build a predictive
    model to predict the likelihood that a car would experience a vehicle crime (e.g.
    theft, vandalism) based on features from the surrounding location. This project
    led me to learn basic data wrangling, how to derive some geospatial features,
    to test different classification models for accuracy such as random forest, logistic
    regression, and Naïve Bayes, basic visualization using Tableau Public, and how
    to set up a pipeline to refresh the dashboard every time the police data refreshed.

    tools I could have used to solve this specific problem? Most definitely. Did I
    come up with the best solution, or even the only solution on the market? Not a
    chance but my solution was better than what was there, which was nothing.

- en: Not only did I learn the specific tools mentioned above, but I also gained more
    intuition on the process of data science. I was able to more clearly articulate
    why I would want to use specific classification models with specific data types
    over others. And most importantly, I was able to speak passionately about how
    these tools allowed me to make informed decisions by combining hundreds of data
    points.

    to overcoming problems associated with that purpose, I no longer feel a lack of
    confidence in what I don’t know. I use that purpose to apply what I do know, explain
    my approach, and identify something new to learn with the confidence of knowing
    that I can.
