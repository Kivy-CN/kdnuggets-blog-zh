- en: Data Science Horizons recently released an insightful new ebook titled **[Data
    Cleaning and Preprocessing for Data Science Beginners](https://datasciencehorizons.com/data-cleaning-preprocessing-data-science-beginners-ebook/)**
    that provides a comprehensive introduction to these critical early stages of the
    data science pipeline. In the guide, readers will learn why properly cleaning
    and preprocessing data is so important for building effective predictive models
    and drawing reliable conclusions from analyses. The ebook covers the general workflow
    of collecting, cleaning, integrating, transforming, and reducing data in preparation
    for analysis. It also explores the iterative nature of data cleaning and preprocessing
    that makes this process as much an art as it is a science.

    collect every day, is filled with inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and missing entries.
    As the saying goes, "Garbage in, garbage out." If we feed our predictive models
    with dirty, inaccurate data, the performance and accuracy of our models will be
    compromised

    used for data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and handling missing
    values. Readers will become familiar with essential tools like Pandas, NumPy,
    Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Missingno. The guide concludes with a case
    study that enables readers to apply all of the concepts and skills covered in
    the previous chapters.

    provides a comprehensive guide to tackling common data quality issues. It explores
    techniques for handling missing values, detecting outliers, normalizing and scaling
    data, selecting features, encoding variables, and balancing imbalanced datasets.
    Readers will learn best practices for assessing data integrity, merging datasets,
    and handling skewed distributions and nonlinear relationships. With its Python
    code examples, readers will gain practical experience identifying data anomalies,
    imputing missing data, extracting features, and preprocessing messy datasets into
    a form ready for analysis. The case study ties together all the major concepts
    into an end-to-end data cleaning and preprocessing workflow.'
