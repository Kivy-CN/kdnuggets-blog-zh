    [article](https://www.trade-schools.net/articles/who-want-to-work-alone.asp) on
    trade-schools.net, which has a large number of jobs listed for the loners and
    introverts of this world. If you read this article you will see that the job of
    data scientist is NOT listed. The rest of this article will explore why it is
    true that data scientists need to work in groups.

- en: Extroverts are happiest when they are with other people. Obvious examples of
    occupations, where extroversion is an important benefit are politics, teaching,
    and sales. Introverts are the opposite of extroverts and prefer being alone or
    with only small groups of people. Any attempt to pigeonhole data scientists into
    either extroverts or introverts will fail. Data scientists include people in both
    groups. A very good [post](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_gb/image/other1/events/WMAGDS/DataScientist-survey-report-web%20FINAL.pdf)
    produced by the SAS organization explores this.

    entails unearthing important information hidden in large datasets and transforming
    it into a form from which future action can come. This form could be a bar-graph,
    spread-sheets, a heat map or something else. This activity is very computer oriented.

    with customers and clients. Sometimes a project is so large that a number of data
    scientists will have to work on the project. They must be able to collaborate.
    The person leading the project will have to understand it and how all members
    of the teamwork on it.

    see how a well-functioning data science team works. One organization that knows
    the importance of data science is *Twitch*, which is Amazon's video streaming
    department. There are numerous sources describing this success. With any search
    engine, enter *data science twitch*. You will get many hits about a group of data
    scientists working at the cutting edge of technology.

    is the Ford Motor Company. Its team has the glamorous name of Ford Motor Company
    Global Data Insights and Analytics unit [GDIA]. The company used data analysis
    for decades before 2015 but did so in an ad hoc manner, until 2015, when GDIA
    was formed at the beginning of that year with a staff of one. There are now more
    than 600 members of Ford's GDIA unit.

    a Phoenix, Arizona, online car dealer. It only has a staff of fifty, five of whom
    are data scientists. These five have greatly helped Carvana in its pricing and
    financing. The use of data scientists is beneficial to small as well as large
    companies.

- en: Some human beings prefer to work alone but most prefer some interaction with
    other people. Irrespective of their wishes in this respect, data scientists have
    to collaborate closely with their peers and interface with non-data scientists.
    Data scientists usually require experienced members of the profession to help
    them into their positions. There are many skills required in data science. Data
    scientists are unlikely to master more than a few of these skills. In order for
    an organization to get the best out of its data scientists, it needs to assemble
    groups of them that work in harmony and have complementary skills.
