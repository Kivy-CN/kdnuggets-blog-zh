    different from features with missing data. Examples of sparse features include
    vectors of one-hot-encoded words or counts of categorical data. On the other hand,
    features with dense data have predominantly non-zero values.

    other hand, if the data is sparse, all the data points are known, but most of
    them have zero value.

- en: To illustrate this point, there are two types of features. The feature with
    sparse data has known values (= 0), but the feature with missing data has unknown
    values (= null). It is unknown what values should be in the null-valued rows.

    of models. Linear regression models will fit more coefficients, and tree-based
    models will have greater depth to account for all features.

    features have sparse data. [Kuss [2002]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.1421)
    shows that goodness-of-fit tests are flawed when the data is sparse.

    is called overfitting. When models overfit, they are unable to generalize to newer
    data when they are put in production. This negatively impacts the predictive power
    of models.

- en: Some models may underestimate the importance of sparse features and given preference
    to denser features even though the sparse features may have predictive power.
    Tree-based models are notorious for behaving like this. For example, random forests
    overpredict the importance of features that have more categories than those features
    that have fewer categories.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sparse features can introduce noise, which the model picks up and increase the
    memory needs of the model. To remedy this, they can be dropped from the model.
    For example, rare words are removed from text mining models, or [features with
    low variance are removed](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#removing-features-with-low-variance).
    However, sparse features that have important signals should not be removed in
    this process.

    methods like setting a variance threshold for including features in the model
    might also be useful.

    may be used instead of changing the dimensionality of the data. For example, the
    [entropy-weighted k-means algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4262534)
    is better suited to this problem than the regular k-means algorithm.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sparse features are common in machine learning models, especially in the form
    of one-hot encoding. These features can result in issues in machine learning models
    like overfitting, inaccurate feature importances, and high variance. It is recommended
    that sparse features should be pre-processed by methods like feature hashing or
    removing the feature to reduce the negative impacts on the results.
