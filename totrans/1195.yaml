    people prophesying on how the field will get extinct in 10 years. The typical
    reason given is how emerging [AutoML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning) tools
    will eliminate the need for practitioners to develop their own algorithms.
  prefs: []

    from taking data science seriously enough to excel in it. Frankly, it is a disservice
    to the data science community to see such prophecies about a field where the demand
    is only going to increase even further!

    of truly retiring in, it is data science, Period. I will give you four key reasons
    why data science is not getting extinct anytime soon. I will also then give you
    my advice to ensure that you stay on the right side of data science in 10 years.

- en: Let’s start with *science*. I don’t have to convince you that science has been
    around for centuries. The essence of science is learning from data. We observe
    things in the world (collect data) and then we create a model (traditionally called
    a theory) that can summarise and explain those observations. We create these models
    to help us solve problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The essence of data science is precisely the same. Collecting data, learning
    from it by creating models, and then using those models to solve problems. Over
    years, various disciplines have developed and refined several tools that do this.
    Depending on what the focus of the field is, different names have been used to
    describe this set of tools and procedures. The one ***term*** that has currently
    gained a lot of traction is *data science*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the difference between previous times and now is the volume of data
    and the computational power available to us. When we had a few data points and
    only a few dimensions, it was manually possible to put them down on a paper and
    fit a straight line (a regression) to it or identify patterns. Now, we can cheaply
    collect vast amounts of data from multiple sources (multi-features). It’s not
    humanly possible or feasible to fit a straight line (or cluster) when you have
    a very large number of data points and dimensions.

    are gaining traction and some of them will likely lead to the democratization
    of data science. However, most of such tools will help accelerate the testing
    and implementation of different algorithms on ***cleaned*** data inputs.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, several data science-related surveys have pointed out the disproportionate
    amount of time that any data scientist spends on collecting and cleaning data.
    As an example, the [annual survey](https://www.anaconda.com/state-of-data-science-2020) by
    Anaconda (one of the leading distribution used by data scientists) stated that
    data scientists spend 66% of their time in data loading, cleaning, and visualization
    and only 23% of their time in model training, selection, and scoring. My personal
    experience of working in the field for over a decade is similar.

    is not trivial at all, and many online courses rightly spend time explaining these.
    However, such a focus on algorithms only creates a false illusion as if data science
    is all about models. Many experienced practitioners are beginning to see the over-emphasis
    on models at the expense of data cleaning. Andrew Ng (a leading expert in the
    field) has been encouraging the data science community to move to a data-centric
    approach as opposed to a model-centric approach that most of us currently take
    in data science projects. In his [deeplearning newsletter](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-84/),
    he states:'

    as though that were a lesser task. My view is that if 80 percent of our work is
    data preparation, then ensuring data quality is the important work of a machine
    learning team.

    participants are provided with clean data and the task is confined to developing
    different models with the aim of maximizing pre-identified performance metrics. *(Kaggle
    is awesome for what it is for!)*

    cleaned data or a defined problem. In most projects, we, a priori, wouldn’t necessarily
    know what features are going to be relevant, how frequently to collect data, and
    what is the right question that needs to be answered. **Welcome to the Real World!**
  prefs: []

    of different models easy and accessible. However, it wouldn’t be able to sort
    the issues that are more challenging in real-world projects. A lot of such issues
    are context-dependent and not ripe for automation.

    people have approached me telling me that they have data and would want me to
    apply “data science” to solve their problem (that may not necessarily be clearly
    defined either). I bet many people who are not data scientists view it to be some
    kind of magic (a tool that you can use with inputting data on one side and getting
    output at the other end).
  prefs: []

- en: Far from it, real projects have trade-offs that need to be balanced. This requires
    an iterative approach where an initial model is first deployed, and then the performance
    monitored as more data gets collected for further refinement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any deployed model is only useful if it is used as intended. This isn’t guaranteed.
    There needs to be a skilled human element that can continue to monitor and diagnose
    the use of the deployed model and come up with appropriate solutions to refine
    it. However, the monitoring part is not necessarily going to be automated or even
    quantitative. Very unexpected and weird things could happen that you may not predict.

    system](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03186-4#ref-CR1). The system
    had cameras that would scan people in shopping malls and public squares, extract
    various facial features, and then compare these with suspects from a watch list.
    The system would then display any matches for the officers to review and decide
    if any suspect needs to be stopped (and in some cases, arrested). An independent [report](http://repository.essex.ac.uk/24946/1/London-Met-Police-Trial-of-Facial-Recognition-Tech-Report-2.pdf) on
    the operation of the system raised significant concerns and highlighted several
    limitations. Out of the 42 suspects identified over 6 trials, only 8 (a meager
    19%) turned out to be correct matches.

    are not even at a stage where models are widely deployed and used. We, therefore,
    do not even have enough use cases of models drifting or going awry to further
    automate such tools. The best we have so far is to identify issues when models
    are deployed (e.g. [banking](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jsc.2404), [healthcare](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2756196), [policing](https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A2983928/view)).
