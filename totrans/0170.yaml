    in open-source AI models are being unveiled almost every week. These remarkable
    developments offer a glimpse into the future, showcasing the potential of artificial
    intelligence. However, while some of these models are accompanied by interactive
    demos, the majority of projects just share a dataset and model weights. Consequently,
    it becomes challenging for non-technical individuals to experience and explore
    these new technologies firsthand.
