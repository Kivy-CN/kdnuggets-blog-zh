    that allow the processing of massive amounts of data. This enables computers to
    grasp the nuances in human language, understand the context, and respond to it
    in a meaningful way. In other words, NLP algorithms aim to bridge human communication
    with AI.

    of NLP over time until it reached today’s potential. The key driving factors for
    NLP adoption were improvements in computational power, advancements in AI and
    machine learning, and data availability. The latter occurred largely because of
    the cloud, which provided better scalability and lower costs for data storage
    and processing.

    approach, an expert manually encodes each rule in NLP. That’s why these systems
    are more static and non-adaptable as compared to machine learning.
