    the power to grant you income and measure of security. They hold your future in
    their hands. You have to make them like you, trust you, think you are smart. There
    are fewer situations in life that induce greater anxiety. Luckily, there are some
    things you can do to make it a little gentler on you.

    not one of them. The title of data scientist means something different at every
    company. To some it means PhD statistician. To some it means proficiency in Excel.
    To some it means machine learning generalist. To some it means being handy with
    Spark and Hadoop. Read job postings carefully for specific skills, tools and languages.
    A well written posting will give you a lot of insight into what they are looking
    for.

    Many job postings are written as wishlists. They sound like a fifteen year old
    describing their perfect mate—a billionaire celebrity-lookalike winner of the
    Nobel Prize in physics *and* the Peace Prize. Those are all fine attributes in
    a partner, but most of us would be pretty excited about finding one or two of

    some of the points listed in the post, but not necessarily all of them.

    - the same process, repeated, each pass going a little deeper than the last. You
    work more of the same example problems and read through more of the same references.
    Where the Pocket Plan only gives you enough to time to dust off your skills, the
    Standard lets you put a sharp edge on them. You can learn about things that you’ve
    heard of but never absorbed.

    where you feel the least prepared. For instance, if the job posting says “SQL
    required” and the recruiter told you that you will be asked a couple of SQL questions,
    but you don’t know any SQL, that’s a gap. Make a wishlist of things you would
    like to dig into deeper and start with the biggest gap. Then go back to the Pocket
    Plan and allocate your time to practice problems and reference reading accordingly.

    and adopt it as a passion project.

    an expensive data gathering process, but it pays handsome rewards to the patient
    candidate.'

    fondness for image processing, share that. If you are an unrepentant asshole,

    with that. If you would rather have your fingernails pulled off than pair program,
    tell your interviewer. If you've only written two lines of C++ code in your life,
