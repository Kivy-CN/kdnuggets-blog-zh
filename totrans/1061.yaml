    for analysis isn’t available.

- en: Data plays a central role in data science and machine learning. Most often,
    we assume that the data to be used for analysis or model building is readily available
    and free. Sometimes we may not have the data and getting the full dataset either
    isn’t possible or would take too long to collect. In this case, we need to design
    a way to try to collect the best subset of data that we can get quickly and efficiently. The
    process of designing an experiment for collecting data is called **design of experiments**.
    Some examples of design of experiments include surveys and clinical trials.

- en: We need to make sure the experiment can be designed and implemented within a
    reasonable period of time. For example, suppose the customer service department
    of a certain organization is experiencing exponential growth in the number of
    calls, and long call center wait times. The organization can design surveys in
    which employees and customers can participate. This has to be done in a prompt
    and timely manner so that data collected could be analyzed and used for data-driven
    decision making that could help improve the customer service experience. If the
    design of the experiment and analysis of data collected is not executed in a timely
    manner, it could negatively impact sales and profits.

- en: In designing experiments, we need to make sure the data collected from the experiment
    will be sufficient for us to answer the questions we need to. The amount of data
    (sample data) collected has to be small compared to the total expected data (population
    data), otherwise it would take too long to collect. The sample data must be representative
    of the whole population. For example, an experiment designed to study the efficacy
    of a medication should be demographically representative (should include different
    age groups, gender, ethnicity, etc.).

- en: In designing experiments for data collection, you need to decide what your dependent
    variables or predictor variables are. For example, if the goal of the experiment
    is to collect data that would enable you to estimate house prices in a given neighborhood,
    you may decide to predict house prices based on predictors or features such as
    the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, square footage, zip code, school
    district, year built, home owners association fee (HOA), etc. It is important
    to understand the important features and control features.

- en: Designing an experiment for collecting data can be very costly. Executing the
    experiment can also involve cost. For example, participants engaging in a survey
    could be compensated as an incentive to encourage participation. Also, data scientists
    and data analysts will have to be compensated for analyzing the data collected
    from the survey. It is important that before designing an experiment, you estimate
    what the cost of executing the experiment would be, and if the benefits from the
    experiment outweigh the risk. For instance, if the results from the survey can
    improve customer experience and increase profits, then the investment would be
    worthwhile.
