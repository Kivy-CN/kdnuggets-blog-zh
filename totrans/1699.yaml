- en: Can nonprofit organizations benefit from data science? A survey carried out
    by [Every Action](https://blog.everyaction.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-nonprofits-big-data)
    finds that 90% of nonprofits indicate that they're collecting data, but "almost
    half say they aren’t fully aware of the ways data can (and does) impact their
    work". This is not surprising, given the fact that most nonprofit bodies do not
    have a dedicated data analysis team. However, the wave of big data is now reaching
    NGOs and government bodies as well, who can use data science to make a bigger
    impact. Data analysis can help these organizations make sure that they're putting
    their time, effort, money and energy into the right channels. Nonprofit organizations
    need funds to fulfill their missions but also need to prove the results of their
    work in order to attract donors. Data science has immense potential in optimizing
    this cycle, and also helps organizations make well-informed, sound decisions.
    While not every organization can afford to hire full-time data analysts, some
    fill the resource gap by seeking help on platforms like [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
    and [Stack Exchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/), or by hiring freelance
    data scientists and consultants through [Kolabtree](https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/subject/data-analysis?utm_source=KDNuggets)
    and [Experfy](https://www.experfy.com/). Here are some examples of how nonprofits
    and charity organizations can make use of data science.

  zh: 非营利组织是否能从数据科学中受益？[Every Action](https://blog.everyaction.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-nonprofits-big-data)的调查发现，90%的非营利组织表示他们正在收集数据，但“几乎一半的人表示他们对数据如何（以及确实）影响他们的工作并不完全了解”。鉴于大多数非营利机构没有专门的数据分析团队，这并不令人惊讶。然而，大数据的浪潮现在也开始影响非政府组织和政府机构，这些机构可以利用数据科学产生更大的影响。数据分析可以帮助这些组织确保他们将时间、精力、资金和资源投入到正确的渠道。非营利组织需要资金来实现其使命，同时也需要证明其工作的成果，以吸引捐赠者。数据科学在优化这一周期方面具有巨大的潜力，也帮助组织做出明智、合理的决策。虽然并非每个组织都能负担得起全职数据分析师，但一些组织通过在平台如[Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)和[Stack
    Exchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)上寻求帮助，或通过[Kolabtree](https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/subject/data-analysis?utm_source=KDNuggets)和[Experfy](https://www.experfy.com/)雇佣自由数据科学家和顾问，来填补资源缺口。以下是非营利组织和慈善组织如何利用数据科学的一些例子。

    that can help them optimize fundraising. [Amnesty International](https://data-informed.com/amnesty-international-optimizes-fundraising-with-analytics/)
    is using segmentation and predictive modelling to help them identify and target
    the right groups, so that they can develop a more refined marketing strategy.
    Data insights help NGOs identify and segregate donors based on various factors,
    using which they can drive their marketing and fundraising efforts more effectively.
    Data analysis also helps charity organizations discover relationships, that can
    help them develop specific incentives. After studying their data and finding that
    they could provide something for their donors, rather than the other way around,
    Macmillan's Cancer Support introduced the "World's Biggest Coffee" initiative,
    which saw a leap in the income generated from [£15m to £20m](https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/mar/04/how-to-use-data-analysis-to-enhance-fundraising).

    activities, and help them tailor their processes towards better results. Data
    analysis and visualization can also play a huge role in real-time tracking during
    crises and optimizing relief efforts. Qlik, a software company based in the USA,

    in which they train Fellows to work on data science projects that specifically
    focus on social impact. The Fellows work with government bodies and nonprofits
    to tackle issues related to education, healthcare, public safety and the environment.
    One of their projects, in partnership with the Chicago Department of Public Health,
    uses predictive analytics to help prevent lead poisoning in children. Lead-based
    paint was used before the ban in 1978, and children who live in older homes are
    still likely to be exposed to it. The models identify houses that are likely to
    have lead-based paint, taking into account various factors, which then allows
    for mitigating the dangers of exposure.

    NGOs make optimal use of their resources, which is primary to its smooth functioning.

- en: That data science bears enormous potential for government organizations and
    nonprofits, big and small, is quite clear. But accessing experts is a common problem
    that these organizations face. Processes are often bureaucratic and funds may
    be inadequate to employ a full-fledged team. And so many organizations don't see
    the power of data science manifest. Organizations like Datakind help connect data
    scientists to social organizations, however, scientists offer their services on
    a voluntary basis. One solution is for organizations is to [consult freelance
    data science experts](https://www.kolabtree.com/find-an-expert/subject/data-analysis?utm_source=KDNuggets)
    for short-term projects. This helps them access the expertise of data analysts
    while keeping the process cost-effective. This is definitely one way the third
    sector can reap the benefits of data science and stay empowered, so that they
    can empower others.
