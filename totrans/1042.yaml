- en: As a beginner, I had many questions about how do I start? How do I learn, or
    where do I get ideas to work on projects. So, after a long search, I found a project
    on data analysis. It took me 3 days just to write code, and I was happy with my
    first try, but then there was this big question of how do I share it with the
    world? I simply did not have good coding skills or documentation skills to showcase
    my work, so I stored it in the cloud and forgot about it. After a month, I was
    randomly looking for more projects on GitHub and found this amazing [profile](https://github.com/subhamrex)
    that motivated me to create my portfolio. That was the best decision I made as
    it put me on the map of the developer community, and soon after, I started to
    get emails from the recruiters and beginners about my projects.

    In this modern world, employers are skeptical about hiring new graduates, so how
    do you convince them that you are best for the job? You display your skills by
    showing the work you have done in a previous project. The stronger your online
    portfolio, the higher chance you have of getting hired for your dream job.'
