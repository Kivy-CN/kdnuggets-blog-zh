    are too many to keep up with. Or maybe you dread trying to make sense of those
    you choose to move ahead with reading.

    do it yourself and have this markup available for subsequent reading, but machine
    learning engineer [Aakash Kumar Nain](https://github.com/AakashKumarNain) ([@A_K_Nain](https://twitter.com/A_K_Nain))
    has made available a [collection of machine learning research papers](https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/annotated_research_papers)
    that they have annotated during reading and shared with the community at large.

- en: I spend a lot of time reading papers. It is a crucial part of my ML work. If
    you want to do research or you want to be a better ML engineer, then you should
    read papers. This habit of reading papers will help you to remain updated with
    the field.

    in the collection are thoroughly annotated, making an investment of time in their
    reading well worth it.
