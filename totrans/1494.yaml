    meant for developers. They also start solving Python programming riddles on websites
    like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) with an assumption that they have to get
    good at programming concepts before starting to analyzing data using Python.

    visualizing and building models; and not for developing software applications.
    Therefore, you have to focus most of your time in learning the modules and libraries
    in Python to perform these tasks.

    data. You might ask then why is Python the most popular programming language for
    data science?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the lower layer in the form of a C or Fortran extension. That is exactly what
    Numpy and Pandas do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    computing with Python. Numpy provides the support of highly optimized multidimensional
    arrays, which are the most basic data structure of most Machine Learning algorithms.

    data, which is also called as data munging or data wrangling.

    Unfortunately, for Python lovers like me, the code examples in the book are written
    in R. I would recommend you to read the first four chapters of the book. Go through
    the first 4 chapters of the book to understand the basics statistical concepts
    that I mentioned previously, ignore the code examples and just understand the
    concepts. The rest of chapters in the book mostly focus on Machine Learning. I
    will talk about how to learn Machine Learning in the next section.'

    to learn Statistics with Python but the author teaches his own custom functions
    instead of using standard Python libraries like Statsmodels for doing Statistics.
    That's the reason why I didn't recommend this book.

    steps. You can find a data set you like and then come up with interesting business
    questions that you can answer by analyzing it. But, don't choose generic datasets
    like Titanic [Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) for your project.
    You can read "[19 places to find free data sets for your data science project](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/)"

    For example, if you want to predict the stock market prices then you can scrape
    real-time data from [Yahoo Finance](https://www.scrapehero.com/scrape-yahoo-finance-stock-market-data/)
    and store it in a SQL database and use Machine Learning to predict the stock prices.
