- en: '[Data for Good](http://dataforgood.co/) is a new non-profit seeking to show
    off the more altruistic data science projects and resources that are out there.
    By using a format similar to Hacker News or Reddit, users are able to submit links
    to relevant sites showing off how data science can provide social good. Projects
    posted to Data for Good are supposed to be approachable to audiences wider than
    just data scientists, with the intent being to show decision-makers in governments
    what data can do for them.'

- en: The projects shown on the site are quite diverse and cover a number of topics,
    from APIs, to videos, to reports showing how cities were able to use data to balance
    their budgets. As we can see above, there is a focus on projects that empower
    “citizens” or contribute back to the “community”. These socially oriented terms
    are what dominate the titles of the projects that get posted to the site, showing
    that the site is adhering to its goal of promoting data science projects aimed
    at providing social good.

    an API for accessing crisis data from multiple sources in a single standard format.
    Another example of the sort of post that would go on Data for Good is [this video](http://www.dataforgood.co/posts/eZBQuzsQSdEsW8TwJ)
    showing how the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics tackled the problem of illegal
    grease disposal using data science in New York City.

- en: As the diagram above (created July 22, 2014) shows, though the number of posts
    for the first week was inconsistent from day to day (they were largely by only
    two unique users), over the past few days, the number of posts per day has stabilized.
    In addition to this, the posts are now coming from a variety of users, showing
    that the site is beginning to develop a more involved community. This is a good
    sign for the site, and hopefully this trend of community involvement continues.

    social good, with KDD 2014’s theme being [Data Science for Social Good](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2014/program.html)
    and [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/) seeking to connect data scientists and
    NGOs for social good. Interest in applying data science toward to improving society
    seems to be gaining momentum.

- en: Overall, Data for Good is tackling the noble mission of showcasing just what
    data can do for society. If they continue to grow and a community forms around
    the site, Data for Good could grow into a valuable resource for discovering opportunities
    and resources in the data science community for socially minded data scientists.
