    years ago detailing the most popular skills](http://dataconomy.com/2015/08/the-data-science-skills-network/)
    data scientists have, based on their LinkedIn profile data. It’s outdated now,
    so you can bet there are skills and tools of the modern scientist that are not
    included in the list.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first question that comes to mind when looking at lists like Jumah’s is
    how many of these skills you actually need to thrive in the industry. Is there
    really anyone out there who can do all of them?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quite possibly, but probably not. What matters most for you is how many of these
    skills **you** can pick up and become adept with. And perhaps more importantly,
    how quickly can it be done?

    of is. No matter who you are, there’s always an ambition to be at the absolute
    top of your field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science especially fosters this kind of attitude, because even if you aren’t
    constantly learning new things, you still need to remain informed about the skills
    and processes you work with regularly. It’s an industry that’s always moving and
    evolving, which means you need to do the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that doesn’t mean you have to know or be involved with everything. Therein
    lies the rub. Step one is admitting to yourself that you won’t be able to specialize
    in every skill a data scientist can use. Yes, you need the core skills — analytics
    and data processing, mostly — but everything else is more of an aside.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So? Narrow down your focus. Choose the skills you use most and the ones which
    will be most beneficial to your career. If your plan is to work with Python or
    Hadoop-based systems, for instance, learning other languages can improve your
    knowledge base but won’t really help you improve your core skills.

    on your learning, education and training. Yes, you can enter the workforce before
    then if you’re new to the industry, but the point is you never want to go more
    than two years without actual field experience.

    on the skills you want to learn. The courses don’t necessarily have to be related
    to data science. A programming course in a relevant language, like Python, works
    too.

    and participate in data problems. R, Excel and similar platforms are your friend.

    a problem. Stick with it and you’ll pick up the pace over time.

    frameworks or databases. This will minimize the amount of time you need to spend
    creating algorithms and code for yourself and increase the time spent actually
    conducting data science and machine learning.
