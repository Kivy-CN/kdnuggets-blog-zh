- en: Data engineering refers to the process of creating and maintaining structures
    and systems that collect, store, and transform data into a format that can be
    easily analyzed and used by data scientists, analysts, and business stakeholders.
    This roadmap will guide you in mastering various concepts and tools, enabling
    you to effectively build and execute different types of data pipelines.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Containerization allows developers to package their applications and dependencies
    into lightweight, portable containers that can run consistently across different
    environments. Infrastructure as Code, on the other hand, is the practice of managing
    and provisioning infrastructure through code, enabling developers to define, version,
    and automate cloud infrastructure.

- en: In the first step, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of SQL syntax,
    Docker containers, and the Postgres database. You will learn how to initiate a
    database server using Docker locally, as well as how to create a data pipeline
    in Docker. Furthermore, you will develop an understanding of Google Cloud Provider
    (GCP) and Terraform. Terraform will be particularly useful for you in deploying
    your tools, databases, and frameworks on the cloud.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Workflow orchestration manages and automates the flow of data through various
    processing stages, such as data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
    It is a more efficient, reliable, and scalable way of doing things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In thes second step, you will learn about data orchestration tools like Airflow,
    Mage, or Prefect. They all are open source and come with multiple essential features
    for observing, managing, deploying, and executing data pipeline. You will learn
    to set up Prefect using Docker and build an ETL pipeline using Postgres, Google
    Cloud Storage (GCS), and BigQuery APIs .

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data warehousing is the process of collecting, storing, and managing large amounts
    of data from various sources in a centralized repository, making it easier to
    analyze and extract valuable insights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the third step, you will learn everything about either Postgres (local) or
    BigQuery (cloud) data warehouse. You will learn about the concepts of partitioning
    and clustering, and dive into BigQuery's best practices. BigQuery also provides
    machine learning integration where you can train models on large data, hyperparameter
    tuning, feature preprocessing, and model deployment. It is like SQL for machine
    learning.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Analytics Engineering is a specialized discipline that focuses on the design,
    development, and maintenance of data models and analytical pipelines for business
    intelligence and data science teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the fourth step, you will learn how to build an analytical pipeline using
    dbt (Data Build Tool) with an existing data warehouse, such as BigQuery or PostgreSQL.
    You will gain an understanding of key concepts such as ETL vs ELT, as well as
    data modeling. You will also learn advanced dbt features such as incremental models,
    tags, hooks, and snapshots.

    and Metabase for creating interactive dashboards and data analytic reports.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Batch processing is a data engineering technique that involves processing large
    volumes of data in batches (every minute, hour, or even days), rather than processing
    data in real-time or near real-time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the fifth step of your learning journey, you will be introduced to batch
    processing with Apache Spark. You will learn how to install it on various operating
    systems, work with Spark SQL and DataFrames, prepare data, perform SQL operations,
    and gain an understanding of Spark internals. Towards the end of this step, you
    will also learn how to start Spark instances in the cloud and integrate it with
    the data warehouse BigQuery.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Streaming refers to the collecting, processing, and analysis of data in real-time
    or near real-time. Unlike traditional batch processing, where data is collected
    and processed at regular intervals, streaming data processing allows for continuous
    analysis of the most up-to-date information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the sixth step, you will learn about data streaming with Apache Kafka. Start
    with the basics and then dive into integration with Confluent Cloud and practical
    applications that involve producers and consumers. Additionally, you will need
    to learn about stream joins, testing, windowing, and the use of Kafka ksqldb &
    Connect.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the final step, you will use all the concepts and tools you have learned
    in the previous steps to create a comprehensive end-to-end data engineering project.
    This will involve building a pipeline for processing the data, storing the data
    in a data lake, creating a pipeline for transferring the processed data from the
    data lake to a data warehouse, transforming the data in the data warehouse, and
    preparing it for the dashboard. Finally, you will build a dashboard that visually
    presents the data.

- en: In this data engineering roadmap, we have learned the various steps required
    to learn, build, and execute data pipelines for processing, analysis, and modeling
    of data. We have also learned about both cloud applications and tools as well
    as local tools. You can choose to build everything locally or use the cloud for
    ease of use. I would recommend using the cloud as most companies prefer it and
    want you to gain experience in cloud platforms such as GCP.
