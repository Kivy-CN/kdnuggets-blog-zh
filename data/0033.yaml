- en: AI has taken over the world in recent years and will still be in the next decade.
    Can’t we imagine coming back to life before AI? I hardly think so, as AI has started
    complementing how we live. The breakthrough of AI into everyday life did not happen
    suddenly; instead, it was intentional by some individuals. Many of these individuals
    are what we refer to as the leaders in AI.
