    words ‘Data Science’ and/or ‘Data scientist’ in the title, published in the last
    2 years, it stands out quite clearly that at the moment the main questions behind
    the most common queries revolve around: ‘how to become and what a data scientist
    is’ and ‘where data science is going’.'

    and conferences still rule the style of communication whereas there is an evident
    lack of documentaries and more entertaining video contents that try to break-trough
    a non-technical, broader audience. The average length is around 65 minutes whereas
    the average number of views is 85,732\. Even though the number of views may not
    be the only performance index, as a benchmark, in 2015 the average views per YouTube
    video of Science&Technology was 6,638, while Educational videos had 4,872 views.'

    the second place of this most-watched top-10\. It is quite impressive considering
    that the average length of the top 50 YouTube videos is roughly 3 minutes. The
    video is the fourth part of a series of tutorials that offer both a hands-in approach
    with some explanations on the theory behind predictive modelling. It covers the
    main types of regression models and some of their applications through some case
    studies. A slow-paced, screencasting with a narration (that sometimes might result
    a bit monotone), but perfect for beginners. The full ‘Data Science with R Language
    Certification Training’ course by Simplilearn is available [here](http://www.simplilearn.com/big-data-and-analytics/data-scientist-certification-sas-r-excel-training).

    Mahout and Hadoop framework. This first part of the series of tutorials hold by
    [Edureka!](http://www.edureka.co/data-science), gives mainly a more speculative
    introduction to Data Science (what Data Science is, the problems it tries to solve
    and prospects), Hadoop framework, R and machine learning using Mahout, ending
    with a more hands-in approach. 2 hours, 32 minutes and 55 seconds. Most watched
    videos on Data Science definitely seem not to follow the typical YouTube golden-rule
    for length.

    special message of President Obama advocating Data Science. This is the first
    video in the top-ten that delivers a broader picture on Data Science, its culture
    and possible impacts rather than a “how to” tutorial. The style is definitely
    engaging, with Dr. DJ Patil highlighting some critical points on how to unleash
    the full potential of Data Science in business and society. A must-watch if you
    are interested into “the bigger picture”.

    a data scientist”. Ryan Orban offers an overview of what Data Science is, why
    the need of it, the different possible pathways to follow in order to become a
    Data Scientist (MS/PhD in Data Science, internships, self-study and immersive
    programs) and the disciplines embedded in Data Science. Dennis O’Brien’s presentation
    is about “What it’s like being a data scientist in a small startup”, sharing his
    learnings and insights with the audience.
