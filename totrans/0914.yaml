    under and ‘thesis’, which means placing. Inferring an idea using limited evidence
    that can be used as a starting point for further investigation.

    to decide whether data and research study can support our particular theory which
    applies to a population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    evaluating these statements to decide if the statements are supported by the sample

    you were given the task to find the average height of your classmates, you would
    ask everyone in your class (population) about their height. Because everyone was
    asked the same question, you will have got a true description and received a parameter.

    of samples drawn from a specific population. For example, if you were to provide
    a random sample of 10 coffee shops in your borough, from a population of 200 coffee
    shops. The random sample could be coffee shop numbers 4, 7, 13, 76, 94, 145, 11,

    the spread of your data. The higher the value, the more spread your data is. However,
    the difference is that standard error uses sample data, whereas standard deviation
    uses population. The standard error tells you how far your sample statistic is
    from the actual population mean.

- en: P-value means probability value and is a number compared to the significance
    level to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. It decides whether the
    sample data support the counter-argument and the null hypothesis is true. If you
    have a higher p-value than the significance level, the null hypothesis is not
    wrong or false, and the results are not statistically significant. However, if
    you have a lower p-value than the significant level, the results will be interpreted
    as false against the null hypothesis and be seen as statistically significant.
