    which was an education policy stating that all schools receiving public funding
    must administer an annual standardized assessment to their students. One of the
    stipulations of the law required that schools make adequate yearly progress (AYP)
    on standardized assessments year over year (i.e., third grade students taking
    an assessment in the current year would have had to perform better than third
    grade students in the previous year’s cohort). If schools were continuously unable
    to meet AYP requirements, there were drastic consequences, including school restructuring
    and school closure. As such, many district administrators developed internal policies
    requiring that teachers increase their students’ test scores, using these scores
    as a metric for teacher quality. Eventually, with their jobs on the line, teachers
    began to “[teach to the test](https://www.chalk.com/resources/teaching-to-the-test-vs-testing-what-you-teach-mastery-based-evaluations/).”
    In fact, a policy of this sort inadvertently *incentivized* cheating so that teachers
    and whole school systems could maintain necessary funding. One of the most prominent
    cases of alleged cheating was the [Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal](https://www.ajc.com/news/timeline-how-the-atlanta-school-cheating-scandal-unfolded/jn4vTk7GZUQoQRJTVR7UHK/).

    a British economist, once said, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to
    be a good measure.” This statement, known as *Goodhart’s Law,* can actually be
    applied to a number of real-world scenarios beyond just social policies and economics.

    increase the number of calls taken at the center each day. Eventually, call center
    employees increase their numbers at the cost of actual customer satisfaction.
    In observing employees’ conversations, the manager notices that some employees
    are rushing to end the call without ensuring that the customer is fully satisfied.
    This example, as well as the accountability measures of No Child Left Behind,
    stresses one of the most important elements of Goodhart’s Law — **targets can
    and will be gamed.**

    models may be susceptible to gaming and/or intrusion. A [2019 analysis](https://twitter.com/gchaslot/status/1121603851675553793?s=20) of
    84,695 videos from YouTube found that a video by *Russia Today*, a state-owned
    media outlet, had been recommended by over 200 channels, far exceeding the number
    of recommendations that other videos on YouTube get on average. The findings from
    the analysis were suggestive that Russia, in some way, gamed YouTube’s algorithm
    to propagate false information on the internet. The problem is further exacerbated
    by the platform’s reliance on viewership as a metric for user satisfaction. This
    created the unintended consequence of [*incentivizing conspiracy theories*](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/10/problem-metrics-big-problem-ai.html) about
    the unreliability and dishonesty of major media institutions so that users would
    continue to source their information from YouTube.

    and achieve desired outcomes in a way that minimizes unintended consequences.
    A large part of this is not relying too heavily on a single metric. Rather, understanding
    how a *combination* of variables can influence a target variable or outcome could
    help to better contextualize data. [Chris Wiggins](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/chris-h-wiggins),
