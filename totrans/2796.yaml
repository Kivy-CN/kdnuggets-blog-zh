- en: The intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence(AI) promises
    to be one of the most fascinating movement in the entire history of technology.
    The emergence of quantum computing its likely to force us to reimagine almost
    all the existing computing paradigms and AI is not an exception. However, the
    computational power of quantum computers also has the potential to accelerate
    many areas of AI that remain unpractical today. The first step for AI and quantum
    computing to work together is to reimagine machine learning models to work on
    quantum architectures. Recently, [Google open sourced TensorFlow Quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum),
    a framework for building quantum machine learning models.

    machine learning programs all within the TensorFlow programming model. Google
    refers to this approach as quantum machine learning and is able to implement it
    by leveraging some of its recent quantum computing frameworks such as [Google
    Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq).

    AI is how the latter can benefit from the emergence of quantum architectures.
    Quantum Machine Learning(QML) is a broad term to refer to machine learning models
    that can leverage quantum properties. The first QML applications focused on refactoring
    traditional machine learning models so they were able to perform fast linear algebra
    on a state space that grows exponentially with the number of qubits. However,
    the evolution of quantum hardware have expanded the horizons of QML evolving onto
    heuristic methods which can be studied empirically due to the increased computational
    capability of quantum hardware. This process is analogous to how the creation
    of GPUs made machine learning evolved towards the deep learning paradigm.

- en: Quantum data is any data source that occurs in a natural or artificial quantum
    system. This can be the classical data resulting from quantum mechanical experiments,
    or data which is directly generated by a quantum device and then fed into an algorithm
    as input. There is there is some evidence that hybrid quantum-classical machine
    learning applications on “quantum data” could provide a quantum advantage over
    classical-only machine learning for reasons described below.Quantum data exhibits [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) and [entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement),
    leading to joint probability distributions that could require an exponential amount
    of classical computational resources to represent or store.

- en: Just like machine learning can generalize models from training datasets, QML
    would be able to generalize quantum models from quantum datasets. However, because
    quantum processors are still fairly small and noisy, quantum models cannot generalize
    quantum data using quantum processors alone. Hybrid quantum models proposes a
    scheme in which quantum computers will be most useful as hardware accelerators,
    working in symbiosis with traditional computers. This model is perfect for TensorFlow
    since it already supports heterogeneous computing across CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.

    operations. In order to do that, TensorFlow Quantum relies on Cirq, an open-source
    framework for invoking quantum circuits on near term devices. Cirq contains the
    basic structures, such as qubits, gates, circuits, and measurement operators,
    that are required for specifying quantum computations. The idea behind Cirq is
    to provide a simple programming model that abstracts the fundamental building
    blocks of quantum applications. The current version includes the following key
    building blocks:'

    machine learning researchers to construct quantum datasets, quantum models, and
    classical control parameters as tensors in a single computational graph.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From an architecture standpoint, TFQ provides a model that abstracts the interactions
    with TensorFlow, Cirq, and computational hardware. At the top of the stack is
    the data to be processed. Classical data is natively processed by TensorFlow;
    TFQ adds the ability to process quantum data, consisting of both quantum circuits
    and quantum operators. The next level down the stack is the Keras API in TensorFlow.
    Since a core principle of TFQ is native integration with core TensorFlow, in particular
    with Keras models and optimizers, this level spans the full width of the stack.
    Underneath the Keras model abstractions are our quantum layers and differentiators,
    which enable hybrid quantum-classical automatic differentiation when connected
    with classical TensorFlow layers. Underneath the layers and differentiators, TFQ
    relies on TensorFlow ops, which instantiate the dataflow graph.
