    few prominent data science libraries, some good ideas, and Python. This article
    will show just how easy this can be, and how few lines of code are needed to achieve
    something interesting.

    is full of SOTA NLP models which can be used out of the box as-is, as well as
    fine-tuned for specific uses and high performance. The library''s pipelines can
    be summed up as:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pipelines are a great and easy way to use models for inference. These pipelines
    are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering
    a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, Masked
    Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction and Question Answering.

    you can read [this article](/2021/06/create-deploy-sentiment-analysis-app-api.html)
    for an overview of creating a simple sentiment analysis API app, leveraging HuggingFace's
    library to do so.

    projects much easier to implement. Combine the two, and this ease of implementation
    is even more noteworthy.

    I will click the "browse files" button and select a recent popular KDnuggets article,
    "[Avoid These Five Behaviors That Make You Look Like A Data Novice](/2021/10/avoid-five-behaviors-data-novice.html),"
    which I have copied and cleaned of all non-essential text. Once this happens,
    the Transformer question answering pipeline will be built, and so the app will
    run for a few seconds.

    Python libraries with some good ideas. With some added layers of complexity, such
    projects can be useful additions to a portfolio of projects to share with other
    data scientists or prospective employers.
