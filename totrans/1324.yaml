- en: Programming is an important part of data science, as are the underlying concepts
    of computers science. If we plan to implement computational solutions to data
    science problems, it is clear that programming is an absolute necessity. To facilitate
    those looking to establish or solidify these skills, we recently shared [a great
    free course from MIT's Open Courseware to start with](/2020/09/free-mit-intro-computer-science-programming-python.html).

    is a good transition step toward solving complex real world problems, including
    from a data science perspective. Today we share **[Computational Thinking and
    Data Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/index.htm)**,
    another top notch MIT Open Courseware offering freely-available to anyone interested
    in learning.

- en: I particularly like how this course is seemingly split into a few distinct sections.
    The first section (up to lecture 6) focuses on computational concepts; the next
    section (lectures 7-10) are statistical in nature; and the remaining lectures
    make up a final section on machine learning, though it never strays far from statistics,
    and appropriately circles back around at the very end.

    without confusing them. Thinking computationally has nothing to do with machine
    learning; it facilitates the separation of a problem into smaller problems and
    allows one to think about the most efficient ways to solve these smaller problems.
    It's a great skill to develop in any aspect of your life or work. However — though
    not intrinsically linked to machine learning — it does provide practitioners with
    the requisite insights to understand the inner workings of machine learning algorithms,
    the solutions to problems using these algorithms, and how to iterate and improve
    on these solutions to make them more efficient, accurate, and useful.

- en: Statistics is never far from the center of a data science problem, or its solution.
    The discussion of sampling errors, confidence intervals, and the focus on understanding
    both experimental data and the potential misuse of statistical learning outcomes,
    are not generally given the attention they deserve in an introductory data science
    course, which sets Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science apart from
    many others.

    these free courses offer a powerful start to someone learning the fundamentals
    of programming, computer science, Python, computation, statistics, and machine
    learning — many of the ingredients to a successful data science career.
