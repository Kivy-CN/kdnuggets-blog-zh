    from data engineering and data analysis to machine and deep learning. A data scientist
    must combine scientific, creative and investigative thinking to extract meaning
    from a range of datasets, and to address the underlying challenge faced by the
    client.

    Sometimes you need to circle back, try a new approach and reframe the question
