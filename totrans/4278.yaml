    foundation of the Russian Empire in 1696, particularly their names, abbreviation
    of the government and years in power. The aim would be to clone/explode the dataset,
    so that each governor could be accessed by the year. For example, the current
    dataset format would not display who was the leader in year 1700 if you try to
    access that row.

    row, therefore our first task is to create a list, separated by commas, of the
    values in the “Years” column.

    column. Based on the observation of the last row, we see that extra editing is
    required for Python to apply the explode function and splaying the years in the
    “Years” column, converting all of the values to numbers, which means to replace
    the “currently” with “2021”, as this is the year when the article is written.

    and x.replace, as demonstrated in the code below it also works for all the values
    in data frame if you need to change it in many rows.

    in case there is a need for an extra index in addition to the one initially assigned
    one to the unique row. It is also vital to create a new “exploded” pd.DataFrame
    to save the results to data set in csv format:'

- en: In result of the explode() the dates in the “Years” column have splayed throughout
    the data set and now each year of governing by each leader represents a new row.
    Prior to that, functions such as lambda(), list() and map() allowed us to save
    time and automatically expand the values (in our case years) between the dates.
    Such approach is useful when manipulating with dates and can be easily applied
    to small or large datasets in any field.
