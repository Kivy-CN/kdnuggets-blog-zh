    a new profession that is expected to make sense of the vast stores of big data.
    But making sense of data has a long history and has been discussed by scientists,
    statisticians, librarians, computer scientists, and others for years.

    Fortunately, platforms like Saturn Cloud let users facilitate the management of
    the Jupyter development environment. In fact, by managing the resources of the
    environment, the user can enable more power in terms of CPU, GPU, and memory,
    just when it is necessary. A platform designed for cloud computing, therefore,
    allows keeping the environmental costs low, allowing the Data Scientist to pay
    only for the resources he uses.

    largely thanks to advents in processing and storage that are both efficient and
    cost-effective at scale. The capability to collect, process, analyze, and display
    data and information in “real-time” give us an unprecedented opportunity to conduct
