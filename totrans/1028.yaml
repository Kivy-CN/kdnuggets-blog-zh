- en: LinkedIn groups are a learning place for beginners, a commonplace to share ideas,
    and build connections that can help you land your dream job or transition to a
    new job. It is a place where people with similar interests share insights and
    experiences by sharing research papers, talking about new technology, sharing
    tutorials, asking questions related to a problem, and taking part in community
    lead events. These groups are monitored by admins and moderators to provide you
    with spam-free content related to **data science, machine learning, big data,
    AI, IoT,** and **BI**.

    from all of them. Most of the time the content is not related to what you are
    looking for. I feel overwhelmed and end up wasting 10 minutes of constant scrolling.
    The LinkedIn groups are pretty much clean. If you see the advertisement, it will
    be related to your topic.'

    consume the best possible content. You get to learn about new technologies and
    share your knowledge with other group members. In short, beginners, enthusiasts,
    and experts are growing together by interacting with each other.

- en: The list below contains the top 18 groups based on number of members. Some of
    the groups are hard to get in. It can take up to a month before group administrators
    let you in. The majority of the groups I have mentioned are highly moderated so
    you won't see **spam posts, self-promotions, advertisements,** or **off-topic
    discussions**.

- en: Furthermore, if you are a small content writer like me, groups provide you with
    growth opportunities. Instead of limiting myself to a few hundred followers, I
    can show my work to hundreds of thousands of professionals and get feedback. Other
    than that, I read blogs shared by other members and learn about new technologies
    and Python packages. LinkedIn groups have restored my faith on social media platforms.
