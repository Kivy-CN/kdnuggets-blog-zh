    on you retrieving data from flat files. However, when you start working or when
    you get in touch with the industry itself, you see that most of the work happens
    through a connection with one or multiple databases.

    ones like Oracle or they might opt for open-source alternatives. The key to seeing
    the forest for the trees here is to understand how databases work. Learn about
    the why and how of databases and the what will come. Concepts that you should
    grasp and know your way around in are the Relational Database Management Systems
    (RDBMS) and data warehousing. That means that relational versus dimensional modeling
    should not hold any secrets for you, nor should SQL or the Extract-Transform-Load
    process (ETL) surprise you.

    A lot of tutorials or courses focus on only one or two aspects of it, but lose
    the general overview of the process that you will need to go through once you’re
    working as a data scientist or in a data science team. It’s essential not to lose
    sight of the iterative process that data science is.
  prefs: []

    how the data science workflow works is by practicing your coding skills: get started
    on your journey with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/).
    There are several packages and libraries that you designed to make your coding
    life easier. Check out the infographic snippet below:'

    worth checking out the open-source alternatives that don’t require you to code
    everything. These tools will allow you to do more than one step in the data science
    workflow at the same time. For example, [RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/)
    allows you to import or collect your data, do some operations on it to clean it,
    model and evaluate it. Note that it’s good to know how to work with these tools
    but that you should keep on working on your coding skills!

    science that they forget the bigger picture out there. Literally. You have had
    some hints in the previous sections about this, but there is a discrepancy. Just
    like the discrepancy between the flat files that you use in many tutorials and
    the databases that are used in the industry, the velocity, variety and volume
    of the data that is out there. It’s a reality that you cannot nor should not miss.

    it’s time to grow: practice as much as you can by doing data science challenges,
    like the ones you find on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/).
    They will definitely challenge you to put the theory into practice. Also, you
    should also let your intuition grow.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Connect*. As a data science learner, you might fall into the pitfall of staying
    occupied with your learning and that of other learners, but it is equally important
    to connect to those who already have some more experience in the field. This way,
    you build up a network to fall back on in case you have questions, need advice
    or tips, or whatever. These people will motivate you to keep up the good learning
    and will challenge you to go even further.'

- en: '*Learn*. Continuous learning and data science could be synonyms. The [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
    and [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/) challenges that have been mentioned
    above will teach you a thing or two about how data science is done in practice.
    Apart from these relatively small exercises, you might consider starting up a
    pet project and explore some things even on a deeper level.'

    on your skills and knowledge that you already have, you might consider a bootcamp,
    an internship or a job. A bootcamp is an amazing way of kickstarting or boosting
    your data science learning. As a plus, you meet a lot of people, and you have
    an opportunity to build or extend your network. Are you having trouble finding
    one? Check out [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/) and [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/),
    but also don’t forget that your [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) Groups might
    also organize bootcamps and workshops for the community!

    you should consider getting an internship. A lot of the big companies like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/),
    [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) have looked
    for interns before, so this is a great place to start your search. Also, you can
    use your social channels or your network to get first-hand information on open
    positions for internships. Lastly, also take a look at startups: these smaller
    companies can be willing to let you learn on the job as long as you learn quickly.
