    the development of machine learning projects. The book contains practical insights
    that are difficult to find somewhere else, in a format that is easy to share with
    teammates and collaborators. Most technical AI courses will explain to you how
    the different ML algorithms work under the hood, but this book teaches you how
    to actually use them. If you aspire to be a technical leader in AI, this book
    will help you on your way. Historically, the only way to learn how to make strategic
    decisions about AI projects was to participate in a graduate program or to gain
    experience working at a company. *Machine Learning Yearning* is there to help
    you quickly acquire this skill, which enables you to become better at building
    sophisticated AI systems.'

- en: The book starts with a little story. Imagine, you want to build the leading
    cat detector system as a company. You have already built a prototype, but unfortunately,
    your system’s performance is not that great. Your team comes up with several ideas
    on how to improve the system, but you are confused about which direction to follow.
    You could build the worlds leading cat detector platform or waste months of your
    time following the wrong direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is there to tell you how you can decide and prioritize in a situation
    like this. According to Andrew NG, most machine learning problems will leave clues
    about the most promising next steps and about what you should avoid doing. He
    goes on explaining that learning to “read” those clues is a crucial skill in our
    domain.

    the technical direction of machine learning projects.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since your team members could react skeptically when you propose new ideas of
    doing things, he made the chapters very short (1–2 pages), so that your team members
    could read it in a few minutes to understand the idea behind the concepts. If
    you are interested in reading this book, note that it is not suited for complete
    beginners, since it requires basic familiarity with supervised learning and deep
    learning.

    my understanding.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NG emphasizes throughout the book that it is crucial to iterate quickly since
    machine learning is an iterative process. Instead of thinking about how to build
    the perfect ML system for your problem, you should build a simple prototype as
    fast as you can. This is especially true if you are not an expert in the domain
    of the problem since it is hard to correctly guess the most promising direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should build a first prototype in just a few days and then clues will pop
    up that show you the most promising direction to improve the performance of the
    prototype. In the next iteration, you will improve the system based on one of
    these clues and build the next version of it. You will do this again and again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He goes on explaining that the faster you can iterate, the more progress you
    will make. Other concepts of the book, build upon this principle. Note that this
    is meant for people who just want to build an AI-based application and not do
    research in the field.

- en: 'This concept builds upon the previous one and the explanation about why you
    should choose a single-number evaluation metrics is very simple: It enables you
    to quickly evaluate your algorithm, and therefore you are able to iterate faster.
    Using multiple evaluation metrics simply makes it harder to compare algorithms.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine you have two algorithms. The first has a precision of 94% and a recall
    of 89%. The second has a precision of 88% and a recall of 95%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here, no classifier is obviously superior if you didn’t choose a single evaluation
    metrics, so you would probably have to spend some time to figure it out. The problem
    is, that you lose a lot of time for this task at every iteration and that it adds
    up over the long run. You will try a lot of ideas about architecture, parameters,
    features, etc. If you are using a single-number evaluation metric (such as precision
    or the f1-score), it enables you to sort all your models according to their performance,
    and quickly decide which one is working best. Another way of improving the evaluation
    process would be to combine several metrics into a single one, for example, by
    averaging multiple error metrics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Nevertheless, there will be ML problems that need to satisfy more than one
    metric, like for example: taking running time into consideration. NG explains
    that you should define an “acceptable” running time, which enables you to quickly
    sort out the algorithms that are too slow and compare the satisfying ones with
    each other based on your single-number evaluation metrics.'

    algorithms, and therefore, to iterate faster.**'

- en: Error analysis is the process of looking at examples where your algorithm’s
    output was incorrect. For example, imagine that your cat detector mistakes birds
    for cats, and you already have several ideas on how to solve that issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a proper error analysis, you can estimate how much an idea for improvement
    would actually increase the system’s performance, without investing months of
    your time on implementing this idea and realizing that it wasn’t crucial to your
    system. This enables you to decide which idea is the best to spend your resources
    on. If you find out that only 9% of the misclassified images are birds, then it
    does not matter how much you improve your algorithm’s performance on bird images,
    because it won’t improve more than 9% of your errors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, it enables you to quickly judge several ideas for improvement in
    parallel. You just need to create a spreadsheet and fill it out while examining,
    for example, 100 misclassified dev set images. On the spreadsheet, you create
    a row for every misclassified image and columns for every idea that you have for
    improvement. Then you go through every misclassified image and mark with which
    idea the image would have been classified correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Afterward, you know exactly that, for example, with idea-1 the system would
    have classified 40 % of the miss-classified images correctly, idea-2 12%, and
    idea-3 only 9%. Then you know that working on idea-1 is the most promising improvement
    that your team should work on.

    new ideas on how to improve your algorithm.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The optimal error rate is helpful to guide your next steps. In statistics, it
    is also often called the Bayes error rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine that you are building a speech-to-text system and you find out that
    19% of the audio files you expect users to submit have such dominant background
    noise that even humans can’t recognize what was said in there. If that’s the case,
    you know that even the best system would probably have an error of around 19%.
    In contrast, if you work on a problem with an optimal error rate of nearly 0%,
    you can hope that your system should do just as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also helps you to detect if you are algorithm is suffering from high bias
    or variance, which helps you to define the next steps to improve your algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But how do we know what the optimal error rate is? For tasks that humans are
    good at, you can compare your system’s performance to those of humans, which gives
    you an estimate of the optimal error rate. In other cases, it is often hard to
    define an optimal rate, which is the reasons why you should work on problems that
    humans can do well, which we will discuss at the next concept.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Concept 5: Work on problems that humans can do well**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout the book, he explains several times why it is recommended to work
    on machine learning problems that humans can do well themselves. Examples are
    Speech Recognition, Image Classification, Object Detection, and so on. This has
    several reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, it is easier to get or to create a labeled dataset, because it is straightforward
    for people to provide high accuracy labels for your learning algorithm if they
    can solve the problem by themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, you can use human performance as the optimal error rate that you want
    to reach with your algorithm. NG explains that having defined a reasonable and
    achievable optimal error helps to accelerate the team’s progress. It also helps
    you to detect if your algorithm is suffering from high bias or variance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, it enables you to do error analysis based on your human intuition. If
    you are building, for example, a speech recognition system and your model misclassifies
    its input, you can try to understand what information a human would be using to
    get the correct transcription, and use this to modify the learning algorithm accordingly.
    Although algorithms surpass humans at more and more of tasks that humans can’t
    do well themselves, you should try to avoid these problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To summarize, you should avoid these tasks because it makes it harder to obtain
    labels for your data, you can’t count on human intuition anymore, and it is hard
    to know what the optimal error rate is.

    is performing. Their purpose is to guide you to the most important changes that
    you should make to your system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**He recommends choosing the dev and test set so that they reflect data which
    you want to do well on in the future once your system is deployed.** This is especially
    true if you expect that the data will be different than the data you are training
    it on right now. For example, you are training on normal camera images but later
    on your system will only receive pictures taken by phones because it is part of
    a mobile app. This can be the case if you don’t have access to enough mobile phone
    photos to train your system. Therefore, you should pick test set examples that
    reflect what you want to perform well on later in reality, rather than the data
    that you used for training.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Also, you should choose dev and test sets that come from the same distribution.** Otherwise,
    there is a chance that your team will build something that does well on the dev
    set, only to find that it performs extremely poor on the test data, which you
    care about the most.'
