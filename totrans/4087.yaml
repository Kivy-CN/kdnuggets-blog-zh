    sits atop the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) (February 2023)
    measuring programming language popularity. There are [many reasons for Python''s
    popularity](https://www.pulumi.com/why-is-python-so-popular/), and you may have
    your own reason for learning it, but for our purposes Python is the dominant general-purpose
    language in the data science space. And that''s why it''s time for you to learn
    it.'

    topics are vast and varied, and there is so much available online about learning
    Python that the overload could easily lead to abandoning the idea. The perceived
    time involved in learning a new programming language (or programming in general)
    can also be a turn off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keeping the above in mind, we have put together the following roadmap for learning
    Python in four weeks. This program consists of curated, freely-available resources
    organized by day and week, so that there is no doubt what you should be studying
    on a given day. For added instruction, we also asked ChatGPT to provide several
    relevant prompts per day for you to, in turn, prompt ChatGPT with in order to
    learn more on that day’s topics.

    bullet points for each day are the prompts to be used with ChatGPT to further
    learn that day’s topics. Hopefully some find the mildly innovative approach to
    be useful in their programming journey.'
