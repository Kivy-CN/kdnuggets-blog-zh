    or even understanding of what route to go down. Do you take a boot camp? But maybe
    you can’t commit to the time constraints. Do I go back to university? But that’s
    a hefty cost, which many people are unwilling to do. How about online courses
    where you can learn at your own pace and not hurt your back pocket?
