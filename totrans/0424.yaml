    Careers, Explained](/2021/05/data-scientist-data-engineer-data-careers-explained.html),
    in which I did my best to concisely define and differentiate five popular data-related
    professions. Each of the professions received a very high level, single sentence
    summary in that article, and the data scientist, for reference, was described
    as follows:'

    can be extracted from it, and the stories that it can tell.

    to come up with a single overarching differentiation feature, the five of which
    could be worked together into a flowchart and used, perhaps, by an aspiring data
    professional to help land on which profession might be best for them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I received some feedback from readers making it apparent that I put too much
    focus on predictive analytics as a defining feature of the data scientist profession,
    and that I leaned on this feature in a way that might make it seem as though data
    scientists do more predictive analytics than anything else — and that other data
    professionals might not do any of this at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This constructive criticism naturally got me thinking: what else is it that
    separates data scientists from other data professionals, specifically? There are
    lots of technical skills, and particular technical languages, systems, and tools
    that are used by data scientists. There, too, are numerous soft skills that data
    scientists — as well as all sorts of other professionals — employ to excel at
    their careers. But what are some of the inherent characteristics of the successful
    data scientist, either those that come with the data scientist to the profession
    or those that can be developed after they reach the profession?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here are five things that I came up with that, when taken as a whole, help set
    the data scientist apart from other professions.
  prefs: []

    they all have some common connecting threads, and hopefully these points help
    connect some of these threads.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The perceived focus of this feature is what I got some flak for. I am going
    to double down here, however, and say that the predictive analytics mindset is
    one of the major defining features of the data scientist, perhaps more so than
    any other. Is it the only defining feature? *Of course not*. Should it have been
    used in a flowchart to separate data scientist from all other occupations? *In
    retrospect, no, probably not*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do data scientists perform predictive analytics? *Absolutely*. Do non-data scientists
    also? *Sure*. However, if I were to put *data scientist* on one end of the predictive
    analytics see-saw, and *<insert other data professional here>* on the other end,
    I would expect the data scientist would always hit the ground.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it's not just the application of predictive analytics in particular situations;
    it is a mindset. And it's not just an *analytical* mindset (minus the *predictive*),
    but one which is always thinking about how we might be able to leverage what we
    already know to find out what we don't yet know. This suggests that *predictive*
    is an integral part of the equation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists don't solely have prediction in mind, but, in my view, working
    from within this mindset is one of the role-defining characteristics, and one
    that a lot of other professions, data-related or otherwise, do not share. Others
    that do share this characteristic likely place it further down the list of those
    valued for the profession in question.

    obviously. Data scientists must have a curiosity about them that other roles don''t
    necessarily need to have (note that I didn''t say that others *absolutely do not*
    have this curiosity). Curiosity is almost the flipside of the predictive analytics
    mindset: while the predictive analytics mindset is looking to solve for *X* with
    *Y*, curiosity will be determining what *Y* is in the first place.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here''s a hard-hitting piece of philosophy: the world is a complex place. Everything
    is connected in some way, well beyond the obvious, which leads to layer upon layer
    of real world complexity. Complex systems interact with other complex systems
    to produce additional complex systems of their own, and so goes the universe.
    This game of complexity goes beyond just recognizing the big picture: where does
    this big picture fit into the bigger picture, and so on?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this isn't just philosophical. This real world infinite web of complexity
    is recognized by data scientists. They are interested in knowing as much about
    relevant interactions, latent or otherwise, as they work through their problems.
    They look for situation-dependent *known knowns*, *known unknowns*, and *unknown
    unknowns*, understanding that any given change could have unintended consequences
    elsewhere.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is the data scientist's job to know as much about their relevant systems
    as possible, and leverage their curiosity and predictive analytical mindset to
    account for as much of these systems' operations and interactions as feasible,
    in order to keep them running smoothly even when being tweaked. If you aren't
    able to appreciate why no one person is able to fully explain how the economy
    works, data science is not for you.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we've come to our requisite "thinking outside the box" characteristic. Don't
    we encourage everyone to do this to some degree? Of course we do. But I don't
    mean it the same way here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that data scientists don't work in a vacuum; we work with all types
    of different roles, and encounter all sorts of different domain experts in our
    journeys. These domain experts have particular ways of looking at their particular
    domains, even when thinking outside of the box. As a data scientist, with a unique
    set of skills and a particular type of mindset — which I am doing my best to describe
    in some fashion herein — you can approach problems from outside of the box in
    which domain experts reside. You can be the fresh set of eyes that looks at a
    problem in a new light — providing, of course, that you understand the problem
    well enough. Your creativity will help you conjure up fresh ideas and perspectives
    for doing so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This isn't to diminish domain experts; in fact, it's the opposite. We data scientists
    are their *support*, and bringing a set of skills that is trained to do what we
    do, we are (hopefully) able to bring a new perspective in our support role to
    contribute to domain experts being able to excel at what they do. This new perspective
    will be driven by the creative thinking of the data scientist, a creativity that,
    when paired with curiosity, will lead to being able to ask questions — and pursue
    answers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, we need the technical, statistical, and additional skills to be able
    to follow up on these questions, but these skills are useless if we don't have
    the creativity to think of interesting and non-obvious ways to be able to investigate
    and ultimately provide answers. This is why data scientists must inherently be
    creative.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everyone needs to be able to communicate effectively with others, regardless
    of their station in life. Data scientists are no different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But even beyond that, data scientists often have to do some hand-holding when
    explaining their work to other stakeholders who may not be — and may have no desire
    to be — fully immersed in the Statistical Analysis Cinematic Universe™. A data
    scientist must be able to narrate someone from point A to point B, even if that
    someone has little idea of what, exactly, either of those points *are*. Put bluntly,
    storytelling is being able to weave a realistic narrative from some data and your
    analytical process: how we got from *this* to *this*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This doesn't end at simply stating facts; the data scientist has to see where
    the stakeholder fits into the equation and make the narrative journey relevant
    — perhaps with useful visuals or other props to help close the proverbial deal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This storytelling is not like fictional storytelling; it's more like "fancy
    explaining," or providing an intuitive explanation tailored to the listener. You
    wouldn't tell a five year old a Stephen King story a bedtime, just like you wouldn't
    delve into a dry, long-winded narrative about supply chain metrics to someone
    working in research and development. Be aware of your audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This storytelling is also not persuasive in nature; it's explanatory. We are
    not data *politicians*, we are data *scientists*. Nothing good ever comes of scientists
    misrepresenting stats in order to bend others to their will. Leave that to the
    elected officials.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I hope this has helped paint a rich picture of what I believe to be important
    characteristics of a successful data scientist. I wish you well as you pursue
    your career.
