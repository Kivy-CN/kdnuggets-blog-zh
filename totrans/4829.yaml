    learning and NLP beginners, but one which is also pretty daunting. Or, at least
    it was for me.

    RNNs can be used for generating text, ranging from the theoretical to the technically
    in-depth to those decidedly focused on the practical. There are also some very
    good posts which [cover it all](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
    and are now considered canon in this space. All of these materials share one thing
    in particular: at some point along the way, you have to build and tune an RNN
    to do the work.'

    of learning, what if you are OK with a much higher level of abstraction, whatever
    your reason may be? What if you are a data scientist that requires a building
    block in the form of an RNN text generator to plug into your project? Or, what
    if, as a newcomer, you simply want to get your hands a bit -- but not too -- dirty,
    as a means of testing the water or as motivation to dig down further?

    a project which allows you to "easily train your own text-generating neural network
    of any size and complexity on any text dataset with a few lines of code." textgenrnn
    is authored by Max Woolf, an Associate Data Scientist at BuzzFeed, and former
    Apple Software QA Engineer.

- en: textgenrnn is a built on top of Keras and TensorFlow, and can be used to generate
    both character and word level text (character level is the default). The network
    architecture uses attention-weighting and skip-embedding for accelerated training
    and improved quality, and allows for the tuning of a number of hyperparameters,
    such as RNN size, RNN layers, and the inclusion of bidirectional RNNs. You can
    read more about textgenrnn and its features and architecture at its [Github repo](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn)
    or in this [introductory blog post](http://minimaxir.com/2018/05/text-neural-networks/).

    be generating Trump tweets, let's go with that. textgenrnn's default pretrained
    model can be trained on new texts easily -- though you can also use textgenrnn
    to train a new model (just add new_model=True to any of its train functions) --
    and since we want to see how quickly we can get generating tweets, let's go that
    route.

    (yesterday, at time of writing), which clearly includes tweets from both before
    and after his inauguration as President of the United States -- from [Trump Twitter
    Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive), a site which makes querying
    and downloading tweets from the President painless. I chose only to grab the text
    from the tweets in that date range, since I don't care about any of the metadata,
    and saved it to a text file I appropriately called `trump-tweets.txt`.

    4 lines are all we need to import the library, create a text generation object,
    train the model on the `trump-tweets.txt` file for 10 epochs, and then generate
    some sample tweets.
