    much effort are we putting into it to make it impactful. It is undeniable that
    resumes play a key role in our job application process. This article will explore

    opportunities is historically high the number of people applying for these jobs
    is extremely high as well.

    job posting has a total of 1200+ views and if we consider approximately one-tenth
    apply for the job then it is a total of 120+ applications and this is just one
    way to apply for the job there would be people applying for this job from other
    sources, through references and directly as well and hence the total number of
    applications would be approximately 200+. The same logic would apply to any data
    science job position hence resume plays a critical role in getting shortlisted.*'

    suggest you stick to the pdf version as this ensures the formatting is preserved,
    that is the recruiter sees the resume the same way you see it.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Profile summary is key to a resume, consider it as an elevator pitch. It should
    be persuasive and should cover information like who you are, what are your skills
    and strengths. This part of the resume will be the main driver for the first impression
    also in influencing the recruiter’s decision hence spend enough time to ensure
    it includes the key details about you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My people include career objectives at the beginning of the resume. I personally
    advocate removing the career objective from the resume and instead use that space
    for a better profile summary. Because most recruitment happens based on your achievements,
    strengths, and skill and not based on your aspirations. So make an intelligent
    decision and efficiently use the real-estate of your resume especially the start.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Make sure the details you include in your resume are in bullet points, be it
    the profile summary or professional/project experience. It is very difficult to
    focus on a long paragraph and hence keeping it simple and in bullet point ensures
    better readability as demonstrated in the below screenshots.

    that you double-check your details. Many people start editing their resumes based
    on their colleague’s or friend’s resumes in those cases ensure the hyperlinks
    are also edited when you edit the text. Like when you edit the email id ensure
    the email in the hyperlink is edited as well.

    like customization can be a differentiator and could help you in getting the immediate
    attention of the recruiter. When I say customizing your resume to the job posting
    it doesn’t mean completely re-writing your resume to every job you apply but just
    making a few minor tweaks to ensure your profile highlights the requirement and
    the expectation the job demands.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an amazing formula that helps to convert your accomplishments into a
    high-impact statement. It was first introduced by Laszlo Bock in his article [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140929001534-24454816-my-personal-formula-for-a-better-resume/).
    This is a very effective technique that can be used to write an impactful resume.
    This formula means,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Accomplished “X” as measured by “Y” by doing “Z”**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in your data science resume.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Example 1:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*“Built a recommendation system”*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is a simple statement, not attractive at all because it doesn’t exactly
    mention the impact of the use case. We can try to improve it by including details
    of its impact by using below the statement,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*“Built a recommendation system that increased revenue by 10%”*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, this is much better than the previous statement but this can be further
    improved by using the Google X-Y-Z formula as below (X, Y, and Z of the formula
    are highlighted below)
  prefs: []

- en: '*“Built a ****recommendation system (X) ****that helped to increase the ****revenue

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is again a simple statement which just says you participated in a kaggle
    competition but doesn’t talk about your performance hence this can be improved
    by including some details like below,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*“Finished at 20th Place in a Kaggle competition”*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is now better but we can make it more impactful by using the google X-Y-Z
    formula like,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*“Participated in a ****Kaggle competition (X) ****and finished at ****20th
    position out of 1250 teams (Y) ****by ****working with 3 colleagues building an
