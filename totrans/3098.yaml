- en: This is a collection of free resources beyond the regularly shared books, MOOCs,
    and courses, mostly from over the past year. They start from zero and progress
    accordingly, and are suitable for individuals looking to pick up some of the basic
    ideas, before hopefully branching out further (see the final 2 resources listed
    below for more on that).

    those which look most enticing to you. All credit goes the the individual authors
    of the respective materials, without whose hard work we would not have the benefit
    of learning from such great content.

- en: For many good reasons, much of the highest quality machine learning educational
    resources tend to have a very strong focus on theory, especially at the beginning.
    There seems, however, to be an increasing trend of getting on to the practical
    from the start, and mixing practice and theory along the way as resources progress.
    This post presents 5 such resources.

    scratch and using particular deep learning frameworks, these resources cover quite
    a bit of ground. They are also all free, so get reading, get watching, and get
    coding.

    above and beyond the basic introductory tutorials and videos out there? This post
    includes 5 specific video-based options for doing just that, collectively consisting
    of many, many hours of insights. If you already possess some basic knowledge of
    neural networks, it may be time to jump in and tackle some more advanced concepts.

    a task. There are some well-known, top notch mainstay resources of mainly theoretical
    depth, especially the Stanford and Oxford NLP with deep learning courses:'

    and want to move to some practical resources, or simply have an interest in other
    approaches, which may not necessarily be dependent on neural networks? This post
    (hopefully) will be helpful.

    available online? With more and more institutes of higher learning today making
    the decision to allow course materials to be openly accessible to non-students
    via the magic of the web, all of a sudden a pseudo-university course experience
    can be had by almost anyone, anywhere. Have a look at the following free course
    materials, all of which are appropriate for an introductory level of AI understanding,
    some of which also cover niche application concepts and material.
