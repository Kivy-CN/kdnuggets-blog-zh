    In fact, it never even gets used or analyzed. This shows a huge gap that can only
    be bridged by an advanced enterprise search platform.

    gone from using full-text and keyword-matching mechanisms to more sophisticated
    techniques like semantic (understanding the meaning behind words) and visual (searching
    using pictures) platforms that define today's digital landscape.

    mapping to comprehend the context and the intent behind the query.

    *“Wow, thank you for sending my luggage to Washington and flying me to Los Angeles
    at the same time. Brilliant service!*” In this scenario, a traditional search
    engine would fixate on words like ‘Wow’, and ‘Brilliant Service.’ However, a semantic
    vector search engine delves deeper into the issue—where it understands the underlying
    sarcasm and customer frustration. It’s like having a support agent who not only
    hears keywords but grasps their meaning and context, offering more effective assistance.

    addresses like 45, 46, and 47 reside in the same block whereas residents of 55,
    56, and 57 reside in the next block. The distance and direction between these
    residents represent the relationships between words where words with similar meanings
