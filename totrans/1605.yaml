    discussed the exploratory analysis phase and saw how the combination of domain
    knowledge and single variable exploration unravels intuitions from the data. In
    this post we will expand our analysis to multiple variables and then see how intuitions
    we develop during the exploration phase, can lead to generating new features for
    modelling.

    i.e conductance. However to get more meaningful insights we have to connect other
    variables layer by layer to the initial variable which we have analysed to get
    more insights on the problem. As far as battery is concerned some of the critical
    variables other than conductance are voltage and discharge. Let us connect these
    two variables along with the conductance profile to gain more intuitions from
    the data.

    span. The idea of plotting multiple variables together across a common time span
    is to unearth any discernible trends we can see together. A cursory look at this
    plot will reveal some obvious observations.

    can be codified to some definitive trends. This can be verified only by observing
    plots for many samples of similar variables. By sampling data pertaining to many
    batteries if we can get similar observations, then we can be sure that we have
    unearthed some trends explaining behaviors of different variables. However just
    unearthing some trends will not suffice. We have to get some intuitions from such
    trends which will help in transforming the raw variables to some form which will
    help in the modelling task. This is achieved by feature engineering the raw variables.

    the required predictive power from the model. We will have to transform the raw
    variables to generate new variables giving us the extra thrust towards better
    predictive metrics. What transformation has to be done, will be based on the intuitions
    we build during the exploratory analysis phase and also by combining domain knowledge. For
    the case of batteries let us revisit some of the intuitions we build during the
    exploratory analysis phase and see how these intuitions we build can be used for
    feature engineering.

    we found out that precipitous fall in conductance is an indicator of failing health
    of a battery. So a probable feature we can extract from the conductance variable
    is the slope of the data points over a fixed time span.The rationale for such
    a feature is this, if precipitous fall in conductance over time is an indicator
    of failing health of a battery  then the slope of data points for a battery which
    is failing will be more steeper than the battery which is healthy. It was observed
    that through such transformation there was a positive influence on predictive
    metrics. The dynamics of such transformation is as follows, if we have conductance
    data for the battery for three years, we can take consecutive three month window
    of conductance data and take the slope of all the data points and make it as a
    feature.  By doing this, the number of rows of data for the variable also gets
    consolidated to much fewer numbers.

    to the variable, discharge voltage. As seen from the above figure, the discharge
    voltage follows a wave like profile. It turns out that when a battery discharges
    the voltage first drops and then it rises. This behavior is called the “Coupe
    De Fouet” (CDF) effect. Now our thought should be, how do we combine the observed
    wave like pattern and the knowledge about CDF into a feature ? Again we have to
    dig into domain knowledge. As per theory on the state of health of batteries there
    are standards for the CDF profile of a healthy battery and that of a failing battery.
    These are prescribed by the manufacturer of the battery. For example the manufacturing
    standards prescribe certain depth to which the voltage will fall during discharge
    and certain height to which it will go up during a typical CDF effect. The deviance
    between the observed CDF and the manufacture prescribed standard can be taken
    as another feature. Similarly we can also think of other features related to voltage,
    like depth of discharge ( DOD), number of cycles etc. Our focus should be in using
    the available domain knowledge to transform raw variables into features.

    about translating the domain knowledge and the trends seen in the data to more
    meaningful features. The veracity of the models which are built depends a lot
    on the strength of  the features built. Now that we have seen the feature engineering
    phase let us now look at modelling strategy for this use case.

    discussed about labeling strategy for training the model. Since the use case is
    to predict which battery would fail and at what period of time, we have to look
    back in time from the failure point label for creating different classes related
    to periods of failure. In this specific case, the different features were created
    by consolidating 3 months of data into a single row. So one period before failure
    would denote 3 months before failure. So if the requirement is to predict failure
    6 months prior to when it is likely to happen, then we will have 4 different classes
    i.e  failure point,one period before failure(3 months prior to failure point)
    ,two periods before failure and (6 months prior to failure point) & normal state.
    All periods prior to 6 months can be labelled as normal state.

    ( logistic regression, Naive bayes, SVM, Random Forest, XGboost .. etc). The choice
    of final model will be based on the accuracy metrics ( sensitivity , specificity
    etc) of the spot checked models. Another aspect which might be useful to note
    is also that, data set could be highly unbalanced i.e the number of normal battery
    classes is likely to outnumber the failure classes disproportionately. It will
    be a good idea to try out class balancing methods on the data set before modelling.

    for industrial batteries. Any use case within the manufacturing sector can be
    quite challenging as the variables involved are very technical and would require
    lot of interventions from related domain teams. Constant engagement of domain
    specialist as part of the data science team is very important for the success
    of such projects.

    tried to cover the critical elements in the process. In case of any clarifications
    on the use case and details of its implementation you can connect with me through

    you.  Till then let me sign off.
