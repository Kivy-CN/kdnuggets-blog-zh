    technology. A few months ago, OpenAI dropped state of the art text-to-image model
    [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/). Only a few people got early access to
    experience a new AI system that can create realistic images from a description
    using natural language. It is still closed to the public.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A few weeks later, [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) launched the open-source
    version of DALLE2 called the Stable Diffusion model. This launch has changed everything.
    As people all over the internet were posting prompt results and getting amazed
    by realistic art.

    You can also check out the [source code](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
    and [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion). It is open
    to the public under [The CreativeML OpenRAIL M](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license)

- en: The Stable Diffusion model is the open-source state-of-the-art text-to-image
    model for creating generated art using natural language. It uses latent diffusion
    to recognize shape and noise and fetches all the elements to the central focus
    that are in sync with the prompt.

- en: The model was trained on a [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) imageset
    that consists of 5 billion publicly available images over the internet. The images
    come with captions and tags.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It took hundreds of high-end GPUs (Nvidia A100) to train the mode, and the training
    cost for Stable Diffusion is around [$660,000](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1563870674111832066?s=20&t=ZyvYA5pRQrx5jJlyD7QpWg).
    During the training process, the model correlates the words with images using
    [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training).
  prefs: []

- en: You don’t have to train the model on your own. You can experience it free on
    Hugging Face Spaces and DreamStudio. You can even download the model weights and
    run it locally.
