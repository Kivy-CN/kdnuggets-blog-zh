    of us are relegated to being locked down, quarantined, sheltered in place, or
    the like for the time being. If you find yourself in this situation and are looking
    for free learning materials in the way of books and courses in order to take advantage
    and sharpen your data science and machine learning skills, this collection of
    articles I have previously written curating such things is for you. Altogether,
    you will find links to smaller collections of just such materials, totalling more
    than 100 high quality books and courses.

    workers who do not have this luxury at the moment. KDnuggets wants to say thank
    you to all people working in the trenches during this pandemic: doctors, nurses,
    medical researchers, mail carriers, police, firefighters, first responders, pharmacy
    workers, supermarket clerks, food service providers, truck drivers, everyone in
    the supply chain, and all others who provide essential services in order to protect
    the vulnerable, the frontline healthcare workers, and to allow the rest of us
    to stay and work from home. Thank you!'

    is a quick collection of such books to start your fair weather study off on the
    right foot. The list begins with a base of statistics, moves on to machine learning
    foundations, progresses to a few bigger picture titles, has a quick look at an
    advanced topic or 2, and ends off with something that brings it all together.
    A mix of classic and contemporary titles, hopefully you find something new (to
    you) and of interest here.'
