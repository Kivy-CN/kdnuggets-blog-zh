    environment](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl). Julia can call C directly
    without a wrapper, integrates top tier open source C and Fortran code into its
    Base library, and can easily call Python as well. Julia is built for parallel
    and cloud computing, and has particular interest from the analytics and scientific
    computing communities. According to KDnuggets' most recent [analytics software
    poll](/2016/06/r-python-top-analytics-data-mining-data-science-software.html),
    Julia placed 8th on the list of most used programming languages. This isn't exactly
    destroying the competition, yet JavaScript did not even make the list and [a recent
    offering](/2016/06/top-machine-learning-libraries-javascript.html) of top machine
    learning projects in that language proved very popular.

    machine learning specialization from there, and so my weapon of choice has always

    all machine learning libraries; one of the projects is a collection of supporting
    functionality for implementing machine learning algorithms. The selection of these
    projects is, unfortunately, not objective; I have continually found that attempting
    to quantify and rank disparate projects really leads nowhere interesting and diminishes
    the overall use of such a list. Therefore, the items selected for inclusion are
    those which I, myself, have decided to use for my adventures in learning Julia.

    it is a collection of supporting tools, such as those for preprocessing, score-based
    classification, performance evaluation metrics, model tuning, and more.

    however, the fact that it implements its reassuring interface and combines both
    Python and Julia models makes it an attractive library.

    not had a commit in a year; however, given that it aims to be a general purpose
    machine learning library for Julia, with a number of algorithms and support tools,
    it's a good stopover for those exploring machine learning in the language.

    working with a dataset that fits in memory on a single machine. Longer term, I
    hope this will both target much larger datasets and be valuable for state of the
    art machine learning research as well.
