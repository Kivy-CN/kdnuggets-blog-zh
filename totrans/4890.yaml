    for comparison purposes we will be sticking with iris for a bit longer. I think
    it's best we are able to still compare apples to apples throughout our entire
    process.

    first post in this series](/2017/12/managing-machine-learning-workflows-scikit-learn-pipelines-part-1.html)
    to get a gentle introduction to pipelines in Scikit-learn, and [the second post
    in this series](/2018/01/managing-machine-learning-workflows-scikit-learn-pipelines-part-2.html)
    for an overview of integrating grid search into your pipelines. What we will now
    do is build a series of pipelines of different estimators, using grid search for
    hyperparameter optimization, after which we will compare these various apples
    and oranges to determine the most accurate ("best") model.

    should be easy to follow.

- en: Note that there is a lot of opportunity for refactoring here. For example, each
    pipeline is defined explicitly, whereas a simple function could be used as a generator
    instead; the same goes for grid search objects. The longer form, again, hopefully
    allows for some better apples to apples comparisons in our next post.

    model with best parameters of each of the 6 grid searches on our test dataset.
    This is not something we did last post, though we were comparing different models
    to one another, but given the introduction to other concepts the otherwise crucial
    step of comparing different models on previously unseen test data was overlooked
    until now. And our example proves why this step is necessary.

    training accuracy) was the support vector machine (without PCA), with the linear
    kernel and C value of 3 ([controlling the amount of regularization](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_svm_scale_c.html)),
    which learned how to accurately classify 96.7% of training instances. **However**,
    the model which performed best on the test data (the 20% of our dataset previously
    unseen to all models until after they were trained) was the random forest (without
    PCA), using the Gini criterion, minimum samples split of 2, max depth of 3, and
    minimum samples per leaf of 2, which managed to accurately classify 100% of the
    unseen data instances. Note that this model had a lower training accuracy of 94.2%.

    types, grid search parameter combinations, and data transformations, as well as
    how to accurately compare the trained models, it should be apparent that evaluating
    different models should always include testing them on previously unseen holdout
    data.
