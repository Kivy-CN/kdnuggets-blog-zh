    Have you read all the algorithm theory you can handle? Familiar with all the concerns
    around machine learning data? But still don't have any idea how to design a real
    world machine learning system? Not sure what kind of software architecture is
    useful? And even if you did, would you still have virtually no idea how to deploy
    and maintain it afterwards?

    is a freely-available course from Stanford taught by [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/)
    which aims to give you a toolkit for designing, deploying, and managing practical
    machine learning systems. Here''s what the course website has to say about what
    machine learning systems design is, in a succinct manner:'

    infrastructure, algorithms, and data for a machine learning system to satisfy
    specified requirements.

    available on the course website, including thorough class notes, slides, and in
    some cases code and videos. There is no access to videos, discussions, or other
    courses materials at this point, and it should be noted that the materials which
    are publicly available are for auditing purposes only; there is no manner of obtaining
    a course completion certification via this process. However, as with past freely-available
    course offerings from Stanford which we have spotlighted, there is an obvious
    benefit to some section of our readers in having these select resources available
    for learning.

    development, deployment, infrastructure, team structure, to business analysis.
    At each step, it goes over the motivations, challenges, and limitations, if any,
    of different solutions. The course ends with a discussion on the future of the
    machine learning production ecosystem.

    design, this course is shaping up to be one of the first stops for anyone looking
    to put all of these pieces together, and those looking to end up with their own
    solid ML design toolkit.
