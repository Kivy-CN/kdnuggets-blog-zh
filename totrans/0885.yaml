- en: Over the years there has been exponential growth in data science applications,
    fueled by data collected from a wide variety of sources. In the last 10 years
    alone we have seen the implementation of data science, machine learning and deep
    learning. Although we hear a lot more about machine learning and deep learning,
    it is the core data science technique that a lot of companies focus on as this
    is where they make money and save a lot of money.

    left unstructured](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/03/11/massive-data-means-massive-opportunity-key-questions-to-help-your-company-find-a-way-out-of-data-stagnation/).
    This is due to companies failing to focus on the data analytical processing phase,
    as it can take a lot of time, money and resources.

- en: The data analysis phase consists of aggregating the data, exploring the data,
    and preparing the mode, consisting of 40% of a data scientist's time in the pipeline.
    Current CPU solutions can make this process much longer, slowing down the model
    development. In order to overcome this problem, there is a GPU-isolated solution
    called RAPIDS.

- en: RAPIDS is a GPU data science isolated platform, where you can produce your end-to-end
    data science pipeline development all on GPU. As mentioned prior, the data analysis
    phase takes up to 40% of a data scientist's time. However, using RAPIDS can significantly
    reduce your data analysis time.

- en: RAPIDS cuDF is a GPU DataFrame library in Python with a pandas-like API built
    into the PyData ecosystem. Users have the ability to create GPU DataFrames from
    files, NumPy arrays, and pandas DataFrames, along with utilizing other GPU-accelerated
    libraries from RAPIDS to easily create machine learning pipelines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: cuDF closely matches the Pandas API, but it does not fully replace Pandas. There
    are some similarities and differences between cuDF and Pandas. cuDF supports similar
    data structures and operations as Pandas for example, indexing, filtering, concatenating,
    joining, groupby, and more. The best way to check if cuDF supports a particular
    Pandas API, have a look at the [API docs](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/api_docs/index.html).

- en: Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of analyzing and summarizing a dataset
    in order to gain more insights about the data and a better understanding of the
    patterns. You can do this by quantifying the data with summary statistics in order
    to understand the distribution as well as be able to detect outliers, anomalies,
    and missing data.
