- en: Scoring an interview for a machine learning job is sometimes the hardest (and
    most frustrating) part of getting the job, even more than getting *through* the
    interview. So in this article we're going to help you figure out how to land an
    interview in the first place for machine learning. This article comes from Jaxson
    Khan’s [Ultimate Guide to Machine Learning Interviews](https://www.springboard.com/resources/guides/machine-learning-interviews-guide/).

    *proactive approaches*, which could help separate you from the candidate pool
    at startups in particular.

- en: Most companies post jobs on their career site. You can always target a company
    and respond to a specific job posting or submit a general application expressing
    broader interest in the company through that job portal. You can also find machine
    learning job postings on websites like [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).
    These are old faithfuls. Definitely invest some time there.

- en: You’ll typically work with a recruiter during the interview process, but you
    don’t just have to wait for them to contact you. Sometimes you may want to reach
    out directly to recruiters, either at the company itself (the in-house recruiter)
    or third-party recruiters who put companies in touch with great candidates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some recruiters specialize in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
    Very often they include this in their LinkedIn profile title, or they may list
    something more general, such as "technology recruiter." What's important about
    recruiters is that they may know about the jobs that aren't even posted online.
    Keep in mind that something like 50% of the jobs are not even listed publicly.
    Quickly searching LinkedIn will give you a sense of some recruiters near you who
    might be able to find you the most relevant companies.

    with a whole bunch of other candidates trying to chase down company representatives
    at a booth? But major universities, in particular, can have decent job fairs.
    However, my real recommendation is that networking events and meetups within your
    local machine learning community will probably be better than a traditional job
    fair. (Read on for more on those!)'

    candidates to take a different tack when it comes to getting a job interview.
    Often you'll need to hustle and demonstrate creativity and grit in order to get
    a position. Startups are one of the main areas of new jobs in AI and machine learning
    and are known for pioneering a different type of interview style.

    in your community, and you may also learn about job opportunities from attendees.
    There are large conferences and smaller or more focused community meetups that
    you can target, depending on what you’re looking for.

    world, with over 35 years in the business. Usually hosted in California, it's
    full of expert speakers on the current state and future of machine learning. You
    should consider this event if you're a machine learning engineer, but there's
    likely something for everyone connected to machine learning at this one.

    It's an O'Reilly event that brings together science and business, featuring speakers
    from top software companies, training courses, and networking opportunities. It's
    a great place to learn about different applications of artificial intelligence.
    It's especially well-aligned to product managers and business intelligence developers.

    on theory and research into the latest developments in machine learning. There
    is a significant focus on computational neuroscience, so it would be perfect for
    machine learning researchers or individuals from theoretical backgrounds to consider.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes it may be more in your interest to attend smaller community events
    where you're able to make a bigger impression and potentially even take on a leadership
    role after some time. It's also a way to get to know people in a local community.
    Often, large events are chock-full of vendors and people focused on bigger partnerships.
    Small events can give you easier access to hiring managers and help you connect
    with peers who could help you down the road. You also may be able to find an opportunity
    to snag a speaking gig or start to build your name within the community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best stops for meetups is very simply [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com).
    You’ll find all sorts of them on the site. Some are quite large; for example,
    the [NYC Machine Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/)
    has more than 13,000 members. But don’t let that intimidate you; many people will
    register for a Meetup but not actually attend. Typically a smaller meetup is between
    10-200 people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another alternative if you can''t find a good meetup or one nearby: create
    one yourself! I know many candidates for roles that have gotten jobs because they
    started the relevant community group. It makes you a connector or an influencer
    in the community. And that''s a great role to add to your CV.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no reason that you can't start doing machine learning work right away.
    One of the easiest ways is to start freelancing. This will likely be easiest for
    designers, engineers, and data scientists, though there certainly can be opportunities
    for researchers and product managers as well. Sites like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/)
    or [TopTal](https://www.toptal.com/) make it easy as a skilled professional to
    create a profile and find work in short-term contracts and ongoing projects, or
    even longer-term engagements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A portfolio can help you build your brand and also be an online record of experience
    for your work. It can also give you some early references and testimonials that
    you can pass on to potential employers. And of course, it could allow you to do
    some genuinely interesting work that could inspire articles for blogs or other
    content that you can use to expand your profile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, freelancing may also simply be a good idea for you to validate the
    different types of work and industries that you are interested in, to help you
    narrow your job search and be more specific in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Portfolios are focused on and given mentoring support through Springboard’s
    online [machine learning boot camp](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/ai-machine-learning-career-track/)
    if you’re looking for an extra boost.

- en: '**6\. Get Involved in Open Source**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to make connections in the machine learning community is to get
    involved in open-source projects. These are non-proprietary code bases and repositories
    that are worked on by distributed communities and are typically not meant for
    profit or owned by a company. They are often in open-source repositories on [Github](https://github.com/).
    This includes the [Natural Language Toolkit project](http://www.nltk.org/), which
    helps deal with human language as a data source, and the various libraries that
    make up the Python [data science and machine learning toolkit](/2015/06/top-20-python-machine-learning-open-source-projects.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies hiring engineers are often particularly known to hire [based on open-source
    contributions](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-land-a-job-using-open-source-3f5b2744a3d4),
    and sometimes will find you through what you wrote. It's similar to the portfolio
    effect. People will often look you up online and want to see what you worked on.

    perhaps a competition or a hackathon is the way to go.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are machine learning competitions like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/machine-learning-competition-ut)
    and [many hackathons](https://www.machinehack.com/) that allow you to work quickly
    on real business or social problems. It's a great way to put your skills in machine
    learning and artificial intelligence to use, and you will be able to meet people
    as well as showcase your ability to make a difference.

    Ultimately, relationships are what can start you on the path to a job, and help
    you close the deal. More than half of jobs aren't even posted on job boards, and
    sometimes the only way through a company’s seemingly impenetrable shell is to
    start meeting people from that company and build strong relationships with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best ways to network is to request only a little bit of someone’s
    time. A quick coffee date is ideal. Meet them on their schedule, at a place of
    their choosing. Reach out via email or a LinkedIn message with a very short note.
    All you need is one sentence about why you're unique as a candidate. You could
    also use this [great framework](https://steveblank.com/2013/08/12/how-to-get-meetings-with-people-too-busy-to-see-you/)
    from Steve Blank.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re successful in getting coffee, treat it as an opportunity to seek advice
    and information from people in the field. And if you're good at growing your network,
    you’ll really get a sense of how the industry works.
