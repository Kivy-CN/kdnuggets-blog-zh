    resource consumption, such as memory usage. Clean coding, on the other hand, focuses
    on readability, maintainability, and organization. Both aspects go hand-in-hand,
    as efficient code is easier to understand, debug, and modify, while clean code
    inherently leads to better performance. By adopting the best practices outlined
    in this ebook, you'll be better equipped to write high-quality Python code that
    is not only fast and resource-efficient but also easy to understand and modify.
