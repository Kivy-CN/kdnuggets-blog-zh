    its implications years ago, the most common question was – is AI coming after
    us?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And while the question remains the same, my response has changed regarding probabilities.
    It is more likely to replace human judgment in certain areas, so the probability
    has increased over time.

- en: As we discuss a complex technology, the answer will not be straightforward.
    It depends on several factors, such as what it means to be intelligent, whether
    we suggest replacing jobs, anticipating the timelines for Artificial General Intelligence
    (AGI), or identifying the capabilities and limitations of AI.

    “ AI will never get there because machines cannot have a sense (rather than mere
    knowledge) of the past, the present, and the future; of history, injury or nostalgia.
    Without that, there’s no emotion, depriving bi-logic of one of its components.
    Thus, machines remain trapped in the singular formal logic. So there goes the
    “intelligence” part.”

    to make AI a reality overall. However, these new jobs can not outnumber those
    being replaced, so we must consider the net new jobs created to see the final
