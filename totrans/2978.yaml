    outlining the American AI initiative. Among other things, the order discussed
    the need for the U.S. to maintain its current leadership in AI. This was followed
    by [another announcement](https://dod.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1755388/new-strategy-outlines-path-forward-for-artificial-intelligence/)
    from the Department of Defense on February 12th, which released the summary of
    its strategy on artificial intelligence.

    China has already surpassed the U.S. in terms of investments in AI startups, with
    close to 50% of AI investment dollars going to Chinese startups (in terms of the
    number of deals, the U.S. is still in the lead, although the share of AI startups
    hailing from the U.S. has been steadily declining over the last few years).'

    that AI would one day enable a whole new world of possibilities has been around
    for decades. Until recently, however, it was largely relegated to the realm of
    science fiction and the works of select few researchers & futurists. It all started
    changing in the early 2010s when the technology and, perhaps equally as important,
    the computational resources, finally caught up, and we got AI (or rather, machine
    learning) capable of solving real-world problems for the first time.

    opportunities to explore new frontiers, build a new generation of successful companies,
    and further improve their societies. However, it also means having to face the
    dangers that AI could pose to their citizens if applied recklessly. In the last
    few years, that meant increasingly prioritizing the “no harm” approach when devising
    the AI policy — the West, with its emphasis on individualism and strong human
    rights record, simply has more to lose and less to gain when it comes to AI, compared
    to other places. While the West, and more specifically, the U.S. might still lead
    the way in AI research, it’s the implementation that is going to be harder and
    more challenging, considering a different level of expectations it faces around
    ethics & privacy concerns.

    West might be optimizing for different results. In China, it would often be optimized
    to deliver the best results for society as a whole, even if it means inadvertently
    harming minorities in the process. On the contrary, the West focuses on human
    rights and fair treatment of every person, including any outliers, which in turn
    creates unique challenges for AI adoption.

    data generated, and there is no sign of it slowing down — rather, if anything,
    it’s been accelerating in the last few years, driven by our ability to generate
    ever-increasing amounts of information, as well as the explosion in the number
    of sources for new data, both on the hardware & software side.

    data every day, and this number will increase to 6 billion by 2025\. Still, while
    in the early 2010s it was the smartphones that were responsible for the bulk of
    the growth in the amount of data, going forward the growth will be driven more
    and more by the IoT devices, which are now expected to generate over 90 zettabytes
    of data per year by 2025 — over 50% of all data forecasted.

    of devices & the amount of data they generate has never been linear, but nowadays,
    this is becoming especially true. While in the late 2000s & early 2010s, it was
    the growing penetration of smartphones, coupled with the declining costs of transferring
    & storing data, driving the amounts of data produced, there were obvious upper
    limits on the number of smartphones that can be in use at any given time. However,
    today, at [3 billion smartphones](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/11/newzoo-smartphone-users-will-top-3-billion-in-2018-hit-3-8-billion-by-2021/)

    as ever.

  prefs: []

    story. As of 2018, there were at least [7 billion IoT devices](https://iot-analytics.com/state-of-the-iot-update-q1-q2-2018-number-of-iot-devices-now-7b/)
    (with other estimates putting this number significantly higher), posed to grow
    to 21.5 billion by 2025, surpassing all the other categories combined. Perhaps
    more important than a specific number of devices is the fact that there is no
    natural limit to the number of IoT devices that can be put out there: it’s quite
    possible to imagine the world where there are dozens or even hundreds of devices
    per every living person, measuring everything from the traffic on the roads to
    the temperature in our apartments (and this is even before accounting for the
    IoT devices used by enterprises).'

    willingness and ability to collect, share and store it (be it temporarily, or
    permanently). And here, the choices we make around what types of data we are willing
    to collect and retain are becoming crucial — any data that’s not captured today
    is by definition lost, and this effect is compounding over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imposing restrictions on data collection out of concern for people’s privacy
    and to prevent potential abuses might be a reasonable thing to do, but in the
    narrow context of machine learning, those choices affect the amount of data available
    to train the models on. This, in turn, means that countries less concerned about
    privacy (with China being a prime example — for instance, see its [experiments
    with AI-powered security cameras](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html)
    to catch criminals) will likely gain an edge when it comes to data.

    applicable to every single problem, and there are some fields (such as driverless

    and the U.S. in particular, has a natural advantage, stemming from the fact that
    it remains one of the most desirable locations to work and live in, and thus has
    an easier time attracting people from all over the world. It could also be more
    tolerant towards unorthodox ideas, which provides for a more creative environment
    and helps to find and nurture innovative ideas.

    to its established system of research universities, not to mention its ability
    to attract top talent from all over the world. Still, in recent years, China has
    established a system of top-tier research universities and continues to aggressively
    invest in it. Today, China is already conferring more doctoral degrees in natural
    sciences & engineering and produces more articles in peer-reviewed journals than
    the U.S., [according to the Economist](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/01/12/can-china-become-a-scientific-superpower).
    Moreover, in AI-specific research, the U.S. lead is even less certain, as was
    mentioned before (see [CB Insights report](https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_State-of-Artificial-Intelligence-2018.pdf)
