    data science experience on your own. By completing these projects, you’ll develop
    a strong understanding of **SQL**, **Pandas**, and **machine learning modeling**.

    given a business problem and are required to query databases to diagnose the problem
    and formulate a solution.

    a library in Python meant for data manipulation and analysis. This will help you
    develop the skills that are required for data wrangling and data cleaning.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, I’m going to provide you with a variety of machine learning problems
    where you can develop a machine learning model to make predictions. By doing so,
    you’ll learn how to approach a machine learning problem, as well as the fundamental
    steps required to develop a machine learning model from start to finish.

    dive into the data and determine whether the user experience is good or bad. What
    makes this case interesting is that it’s up to you to determine what ‘good’ and
    ‘bad’ mean and how the user experience will be evaluated.
