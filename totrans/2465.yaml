    much math do I need to know for machine learning?**" Students looking to break
    into machine learning often see math as a huge barrier to entry.

    data scientists to build machine learning models that can predict customer churn,
    perform segmentation, and forecast sales.

    fairly repetitive. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, and they use out-of-the-box

    model, an intuitive understanding of specific topics are enough. You don’t need
    to go to deep, and definitely don’t need to be an expert at math to become a data
    scientist.

    fit in linear regression. You don’t need to start learning how to solve differential
    equations, you simply need to understand the principles of calculus to get an
    idea of how this is done.

    to perform a lot of matrix manipulation, but you will be doing this with the help
    of a computer program. Due to this, you don’t need to go back and practice solving
    algebraic equations. You just need to understand how they work.

    This course on edX will teach you linear algebra at an undergraduate level. It
    starts off at a slow space, and you will be able to take this course as long as
    you have high-school level math knowledge.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best part about this course is that it teaches you linear algebra with practical
    examples in Matlab, which makes you look at the subject through the lens of algorithms
    and programming. This learning approach is especially useful if your goal is to
    learn linear algebra for machine learning.

    my own quest for math learning resources.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many machine learning aspirants swear by this course, since it provides learners
    with a conceptual understanding of linear algebra. Rather than learning arbitrary
    formulas or working to derive them mechanically, you will gain an intuition into
    how linear algebra works. This is very helpful if your end goal is to apply these
    concepts to machine learning models.

- en: There are two courses I recommend for learning calculus for machine learning.
    The [Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM) is a great
    introductory calculus course by 3Blue1Brown. Again, this will provide you with
    an intuitive understanding of calculus concepts, and goes deeper to explain the
    significance behind formulas rather than just getting you to memorize them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, you can take 3Blue1Brown’s [Neural Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
    series. If you know how to implement neural networks using libraries like Keras,
    but don’t really understand the working behind these models, you should take this
    course. It provides you with a comprehensive explanation of the gradient descent
    algorithm, along with the calculus concepts behind it.

    formulas, and explains machine learning models in a conceptual way.

    since the instructors tend to use notation that might confuse you otherwise.

    techniques like ridge and lasso regression and when to use them. There is an entire
    lecture dedicated to techniques used to mitigate overfitting, and the underlying
    mathematical intuition behind them is explained.

    to stop treating machine learning models as black boxes. I gained an understanding
    of where different types of models should be used, when dimensionality reduction
    should be applied, and when to perform different kinds of feature selection techniques.

    and linear algebra. However, despite spending a lot of time learning formulas
    and solving differential equations, there was a disconnect in my knowledge, since
    I never quite understood how these concepts related to machine learning algorithms.

    you with a conceptual understanding of the math behind machine learning rather
    than taking you down the rabbit hole of complex formulas and theorems.
