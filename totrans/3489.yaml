- en: In 1958, the Monotones asked, “Who Wrote the Book of Love?”. If we fast forward
    58 years to the present day, would the ‘Algorithm of Love’ be a more accurate
    title? It is certainly a valid question; such is the popularity of the modern
    online dating website. Users can forego the inevitable awkwardness of blind or
    speed dating altogether, having found out every last detail about their date before
    they ever have to meet them in person.

    websites utilise some form of collaborative filtering or a ‘Netflix style’ recommendation
    algorithm that matches people with their potential partners based on shared interests
    and hobbies or mutual likes and dislikes. Joseph Essas, former CEO of EHarmony,
    wrote in 2011 that his site’s user compatibility matches are based on three distinct
    areas: psychological compatibility, interpersonal chemistry and physical attraction.'

- en: Given that the cornerstone of how online dating websites work is to match people
    with similar interests and personality traits. Here’s my question - what about
    the relationships that exist and function beautifully because people are so different?
    I recently got engaged and feel extremely lucky. However, I’m confident that no
    online dating website would have matched me to my fiancée. I love sport, she finds
    it boring. She doesn’t like wine, I love it. I read lots, she’s a movie addict.
    Our music tastes are completely different. I love walking, she’d prefer to cycle.
    She loves shopping, I don’t. Spaghetti Bolognese is the best thing in the world,
    she disagrees. She’s 5ft, I’m 6ft2\. You can see what I’m getting at…. Can Machine
    Learning help identify the non-matches that in reality are a perfect fit? Is it
    capable of understanding that opposites often attract? Are online dating websites
    keeping you from the love of your life because you’ve not followed the same question
    path?

    help people find love. Match.com’s recent stats are staggering, having apparently
    been responsible for 500,000 relationships, 92,000 marriages and over a million
    babies. I don’t have an overriding conclusion on this subject, just a thought
    that it would be a great shame if the spontaneity of meeting someone whilst having
    a coffee or bumping into someone in the park was lost, because people were too
    busy swiping left and right on their phones to notice their ideal partner walking
    past them. It is Valentine’s Day this Sunday, and many of those who will be celebrating
    will have met through dating websites, and many will have met because they were
    just in the right place at the right time. My point is that the wrong person according
    to an algorithm could be the right person according to your heart.
