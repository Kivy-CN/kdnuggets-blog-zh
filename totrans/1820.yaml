    about exercise science, focusing on what we do with those calories. Or we can
    talk holistically about the outcome -- which I would argue deals with an issue
    of greater importance about which most people ultimately care -- health science.
    Given the argument that the outcome, health science, is generally more interesting
    than the raw material, nutrition, or the process for turning raw materials into
    something more useful, exercise, why do we tend to speak about data science as
    opposed to predictive science?

    includes other machine learning techniques, such as clustering and frequent itemset
    mining. It also includes data visualization and data storytelling. It can also
    encompass the various aspects of traditional [data mining frameworks](/2016/03/data-science-process-rediscovered.html),
    like The KDD Process, including data selection, preprocessing, and transformation.
    Data science can also include other algorithms and approaches to data-related
    tasks beyond what I have mentioned here.

    and other analytic processes, statistics and related branches of mathematics,
    increasingly borrows from high performance scientific computing, all in order
    to ultimately extract insight from data and use this new-found information to
    tell stories.

    section of data science which I am measuring it against. In fact, the disassembly
    of data science into constituent "sciences" (clustering science, for example)
    would certainly help express what exactly it is we do, at the obvious expense
    of a sexy umbrella buzzword.

- en: But taking a step back, it is inarguable that data is input, a raw material.
    In this sense, data science places the emphasis on the "what" in predictive processes.
    While the data is a prime ingredient in the predictive puzzle, and possibly the
    most difficult to procure or otherwise come across, "data science" seems to neglect
    the other major component as well as the interesting insights.

    This focuses on the tools, the "how," and is firmly rooted in computer science.
    Again, this falls short of accurately describing the holistic predictive process;
    data is abandoned in favor of the processes which transform it into prediction.
    Any successful description would likely focus on the end result.'

    the hypothesis](https://www.quora.com/What-is-hypothesis-in-machine-learning)?
    I don't mean this in a general "[hypothesis vs. prediction](http://madaboutscience.weebly.com/prediction-vs-hypothesis.html)"
    sort of way, but in a "is the prediction or the hypothesis the more valuable output
    from a particular classifier/model?"

    piece of the holistic predictive science puzzle. Predictive science - or prediction
    science, if that strikes you better - sounds pretty good. But really, isn't that
    just "[science](http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/scientific_method.html)?" That
    seems very non-specific.

    However, the emphasis in this case is on the application of statistical processes
    at the expense of... well, not much, really. Yet I would argue that this actually
    does not place the proper emphasis on inferential and prescriptive statistics,
    and perhaps implies too much reliance on descriptive, and thus seems to also fall
    short in describing the science of prediction.

    business world at this point than to the world of science. I don't see this term
    brought up in research at all, and it generally seems to be the sole domain of
    big business. And that's fine for what it is, but what it is does not seem to
    put science at its forefront (though, clearly, science underlies its usage).

    this is a problem that exists outside of my own head. But I think everything about
    boils down to the following, and can be generalized beyond the prediction aspect
    of data science: Does the term **data science** actually represent anything of
    value to us, the data scientists, or to everyone else?'

    be passed over. Which is fine. But as someone who is not terribly excited by,
    or comfortable with, the term "data science," I think it's worth being introspective
    about what it is we do, and how we categorize those tasks. Sure, there is a convenience
    at being able to put a name to a broad profession of somewhat related tasks, but
    do we lose the trees through this forest?

    new oil, and algorithms the special sauce, but their paired predictive power is
    where the actual money is, both figuratively and literally.
