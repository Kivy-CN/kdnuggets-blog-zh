    site data from google analytics and present these insights to the director of
    digital marketing. And they predominantly use SQL and Tableau to perform this
    analysis but rarely use Python or R. Adding to this, if they also mention that
    most of the Marketing Data Analysts learn R or Python on the job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    learning Python or R, in the first place, I would have wasted my time.

    to your two questions in this section. Don’t immediately sign up for a course
    to learn the technical skills required to build your project. Instead, you should

    this approach from Josh Kaufman, the author of the book "The First 20 Hours: How
    to Learn Anything . . . Fast!".'

    Tableau to visualize the insights of my analysis. Your first step is to find a
    data source for your project. You can find interesting data sets on Kaggle. You
    can also go through "[19 places to find free data sets for your data science project](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/)"
    for finding data sets.

    dataset from Kaggle. I then install Microsoft SQL server on my laptop and then
    upload my dataset to the SQL server. I am doing this because based on my answers
    I know that Marketing Data Analysts use SQL to retrieve data. So I want to demonstrate
    that I know SQL.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your first step in your project is to understand the dataset and come up with
    2 to 3 interesting business questions you can answer by analyzing it.  You also
    need to know what columns (or features) in the dataset you need to answer these
    questions. This is where your domain knowledge comes into play.

    I learn the basics of SQL and Tableau. You shouldn’t spend more than 10 hours
    on learning the basics.

- en: Once you learn the basics, your next step is to get in touch with a mentor who
    can help you to create a detailed plan on how to approach your project in a step
    by step manner. Choose a mentor who has good experience in data science. You can
    use services like [Clarity](https://clarity.fm/) or [Mentor Cruise](https://mentorcruise.com/)
    to find experienced data scientists. Schedule a call with your data science mentor
    and ask them what’s the best way to approach the problem.  Explain the business
    questions you are trying to answer in detail.

    the technical details to minimum because you are writing this blog post to target
    business managers in the hiring team. A hiring team will consist of both technical
