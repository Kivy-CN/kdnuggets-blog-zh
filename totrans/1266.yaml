    environment.

    tons of other tools for that out there. It’s also not a 100% guarantee that you’re

  zh: 起初，敏捷工程实践可能会让你感觉进展缓慢。对偶编程的要求是两位工程师：他们难道不能同时实现更多的代码吗？而且，为什么要关心测试？这只是更多的代码需要编写和维护——而且这需要时间！信不信由你，我确实听到过这样的论点……
- en: The sad fact is that most prototype code ends up in the trash. There’s no denying
    it. So is it worth it to care about the quality of such code? I’d argue it is.

  zh: 令人遗憾的是，大多数原型代码最终都被丢弃了。这是不可否认的。那么，关心这种代码的质量是否值得？我认为是值得的。
- en: Prototypes often end up being forgotten scripts living in some ancient repositories.
    But from time to time, somebody (including you!) may want to give them a second
    life. If the code is a total mess, the resurrection won’t happen, or it will be
    a painful one.

  zh: 原型经常变成被遗忘的脚本，存在于一些古老的仓库中。但时不时地，某个人（包括你！）可能会想要让它们重获新生。如果代码一团糟，那么复活将不会发生，或者会很痛苦。
- en: And what if your prototype is successful? I bet that as soon as you show promising
    results to the broader public, there will be people who will want to use it...
    *right now.* But if you create a Frankenstein’s monster, you’ll be the one dealing
    with it. Respecting good practices pays dividends at such moments.

  zh: 如果你的原型成功了会怎样？我敢打赌，一旦你向更广泛的公众展示了有前景的结果，就会有人想要立刻使用它。*不过，如果你创造了一个弗兰肯斯坦的怪物，你就得自己处理它。*
    尊重良好的实践在这种时候是值得的。
- en: 'To sum up: when you’re implementing a prototype, focus on delivering working
    software relatively fast. But *don’t* treat it as a green light for gigantic functions
    or any other lousy stuff. Perhaps refactor your code less frequently and don’t
    aim for 100% test coverage. Allow yourself to be less rigorous, but try to find
    a balance.'

  zh: 总结一下：在实现原型时，专注于相对较快地交付可工作的软件。但*不要*把它当作实现巨大功能或其他糟糕工作的绿灯。也许你可以减少重构代码的频率，不必追求100%的测试覆盖率。允许自己不那么严格，但要尽量找到平衡。

- en: When all is said and done, it’s plain to see that Agile is not reserved for
    software developers only. The numbers prove that it’s absolutely also used in
    other areas of IT.

  zh: 说到底，很明显敏捷方法不仅仅适用于软件开发人员。数据显示，它在信息技术的其他领域也得到了广泛应用。

    array of problems, such as unit testing and test-driven development.

  zh: 有很多敏捷实践可以有效地应用于各种问题，比如单元测试和测试驱动开发。
- en: However, there are aspects of the Data Science world that make it harder to
    go Agile. I’d argue that the more engineering responsibilities you have, the more
    Agile practices it’ll be easy for you to apply with success. On the flip side,
    Agile for analytics and research often requires a substantial change of perspective.

  zh: 然而，数据科学领域的一些方面使得采用敏捷方法变得更加困难。我认为，工程责任越多，你成功应用敏捷实践的可能性就越大。另一方面，分析和研究的敏捷方法往往需要一种实质性的观念转变。
- en: All in all, I strongly believe that regardless of the nature of your project,
    you will benefit from incorporating Agile into your process. I hope that these
    guidelines will help you take your first steps in this direction.
