- en: Learning from random data science courses will cause a lot of confusion about
    the career path. It will also make you frustrated as you will be putting the time
    and energy into learning something that has no real value. So, if you want to
    learn everything about the world of data and get certified within a year then
    I will suggest that you sign up for a data science career track. A simple data
    science track consists of several courses that will prepare you for real-life
    challenges. It will also help you build the data science portfolio projects and
    provide career support.

    learn to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data. It will also teach you
    the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The
    data science career track is perfectly balanced with theory, live coding, assessment
    test, guided projects, and tutorials. After completing the data science track,
    the platform will guide you to take certification tests, and after securing your
    certificate, DataCamp will help you find your next dream data job.'

    some kind of promotion which is great. You can also get 2 months free premium
    through [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack/offers?sort=popularity&tag=Learn),
    or if you are part of an **NGO**, you can apply to receive a free yearly subscription.
    The content and interactive exercise make it quite appealing for **non-technical**
    professionals. Data science professional certificate is hard to get, and slowly
    it is becoming an industry standard.

    Selvaraj explains how to avoid tutorial traps. It’s all about making logical choices
    for your future without wasting time on random tutorials. She explains how every
    other tutorial is teaching you the same thing, and you're not progressing. If
    you want to avoid the tutorial trap and walk on a straight path to success, then
    start with any of the career tracks I have mentioned. The career track will teach
    you everything in perfect order and provide you with the opportunity to work on
    highly in-demand portfolio projects.
