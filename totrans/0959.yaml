- en: When you hear about distribution in relation to statistics, a lot of us will
    refer to the most common symmetrical bell curve which many of us are familiar
    with it being known as a normal distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution. If the distribution is either
    shifted to the left or right - this means that it is skewed. It represents how
    a given distribution varies from a normal distribution - which is known to have
    a skew of zero.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A distribution can either be right (positive), left (negative), or at zero skewness.
    The tail of the distribution in positive and negative skews starts to move away
    from the median.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zero skewness is symmetrical - the left and right side mirror one another. As
    I said, many of us will know this as normal distribution - however, the normal
    distribution is not the only form of distribution with zero skewness. If the distribution
    is symmetrical, it will have zero skew - for example uniform distribution.
  prefs: []

    equal.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right, skew is also known as positive skew. Positive skew has a longer or fatter
    tail on the right of the distribution. In a positive skew, the mean is typically
    greater than the median - this is due to values in the tail which naturally affect
    the mean more than the median.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Left skew is also known as negative skew. Negative skew has a longer or fatter
    tail on the left of the distribution. In a negative skew, the mean will be less
    than the median.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When working with data and applying statistical tools - many hope for a normal
    distribution. However, that is not always the case and you may end up with skewed
    data. So what can you do with skewed data that requires a normal distribution?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depends on the intensity of the skew
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the intensity of your skewed data, you may not need to do anything
    at all. This is for skewed data that is mild or moderate.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may need to use another model that does not aim for data that will be normally
    distributed. For example, you could choose a nonparametric test. These tests do
    not make assumptions about the data.

- en: Transforming in the sense of statistical skew refers to applying the same function
    to all the observations of a variable. Your choice to transform your skewed data
    is dependent on the type of skew you are facing, for example, is it moderately
    skewed or is it very strongly skewed?
