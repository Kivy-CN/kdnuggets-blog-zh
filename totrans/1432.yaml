    we see a mix of what could be considered natural technological progression peppered
    with some more ambitious forecasts. There were a few general themes, as well as
    a couple of singular prognoses of note.

    prediction certainly seems to have panned out. Talk of advances in automated machine
    learning was prevalent, though opinions were split as to whether it would be useful
    or would falter. I think the jury is still out on this to some degree, but when
    expectations of the technology are tempered it becomes easier to see it as a useful
    addition as opposed to a looming replacement. Increased AI for good was also singled
    out, for good reason, and there are myriad examples to point to the accuracy of
    this prediction. The idea that practical machine learning would have a reckoning
    was put out there, signalling that fun and games is coming to an end and it's
    now time for machine learning to put up. This rings true, with anecdotal evidence
    of practitioners seeking out these opportunities mounting. Finally, mention of
    the increased concern surrounding dystopian AI developments regarding surveillance,
    fear, and manipulation can confidently be added to the successful predictions
    category by a simple spot-check of the past year's news.

    Deep Learning and NLP. Or more concretely, the year of language models. Or even
    more concretely the year of Transformers and GPT-2\. Yes, it might be hard to
    believe, but it has been less than a year since OpenAI first ~~released~~ talked
    about their [GPT-2 language model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).
    This blog post sparked a lot of discussions about AI safety since OpenAI did not
    feel comfortable releasing the model. Since then, the model was publicly replicated,
    and [finally released](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/). However,
    this has not been the only advance in this space. We have seen Google publish
    [AlBERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11942.pdf) or [XLNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237),
    and also talk about how BERT has been the largest improvement to Google search
    in years. Everyone, from [Amazon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09408), and [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/dialogpt),
    to [Facebook](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/a-new-generative-qa-model-that-learns-to-answer-the-whole-question/)
    seems to have really bought into the Language Model revolution, and I do expect
    to see impressive advances in this space in 2020 and it seems we are getting closer
    and closer to passing the Turing Test.

- en: Researchers aimed to develop a better understanding of deep learning, its generalization
    properties, and its failure cases. Reducing dependence on labeled data was a key
    focus, and methods like self-training gained ground. Simulations became more relevant
    for AI training and more realistic in visual domains such as autonomous driving
    and robot learning, including on NVIDIA platforms such as DriveSIM and Isaac.
    Language models went big, e.g. NVIDIA’s 8 billion Megatron model trained on 512
    GPUs, and started producing coherent paragraphs. However, researchers showed spurious
    correlations and undesirable societal biases in these models. AI regulation went
    mainstream with many prominent politicians voicing their support for ban of face
    recognition by Governmental agencies. AI conferences started enforcing a code
    of conduct and increased their efforts to improve diversity and inclusion, starting
    with the NeurIPS name change last year. In the coming year, I predict that there
    will be new algorithmic developments and not just superficial application of deep
    learning. This will especially impact “AI for science” in many areas such as physics,
    chemistry, material sciences and biology.

    such as YOLOv3, for various complex computer vision tasks, particularly for real-time
    object detection. We have also seen Generative Adversarial Networks continue to
    attract interest in the Deep Learning community for image synthesis with the BigGAN
    model on ImageNet generation, and the StyleGAN for human image synthesis. This
    year we have also realised how easy it is to fool Deep Learning models, some studies
    also show how deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. In
    2019 we have also seen biased AI decision-making models being deployed for facial
    recognition, hiring, and legal applications. In 2020, I expect to see development
    in multi-tasking AI models which are designed to be generic and multi-purposed,
    and I also expect to see increased interest in developing ethical AI models, since
    AI is changing decision making in the health, financial services, automotive and
    many other sectors.

    this trend is the success of transfer learning, which has made it easier for anyone
    to train their own models with good accuracy, fine-tuned to their very specific
    use case. With one user per model, there''s no real economy of scale for a service
    provider to exploit. Another advantage of transfer learning is that datasets don''t
    need to be as large anymore, so annotation is moving in-house as well. The in-housing
    trend is a positive development: commercial AI is a lot less centralized than
    many people thought it would be. A few years ago, people worried that everyone
    would get "their AI" from just one provider. Instead people aren''t getting their

    been in the areas of Auto-ML, Explainable AI and Deep Learning. Democratization
    of Data Science remains a key aspect since the last couple of years and various
    tools and frameworks pertaining to Auto-ML are trying to make this easier. The
    caveat still remains that we need to be careful when using these tools to make

    transparency still remain key factors for customers, businesses and enterprises
    to accept decisions made by AI. Hence Explainable AI is no longer a topic just
    restricted to research papers. A lot of excellent tools and techniques have started
    making machine learning model decisions more interpretable. Last but not the least,
    we have seen a lot of progress in the world of Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
