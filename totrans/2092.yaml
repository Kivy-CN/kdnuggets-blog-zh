    (large language models) is challenging and reserved for experts and engineers.
    However, what if I told you that all you need is proficiency in Python to build
    a wide range of LLM projects, from Q&A systems to YouTube summarizers? You can
    even create your own GPT-4o application using multiple open-source models and
    components.

    newcomers to APIs and natural language processing. The project involves using
    the YouTube API to extract transcripts from videos and the OpenAI API to summarize
    these transcripts. Given that some videos can be lengthy, and the context window
    of models like ChatGPT might be limited, the project requires splitting the transcript
    into manageable parts. Each part is summarized individually, and the summarized
    sections are then combined to produce a coherent summary of the entire video.
