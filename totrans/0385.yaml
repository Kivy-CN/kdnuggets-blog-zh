    math, statistics, and probability. I even considered machine learning as a trial
    and error experiment where you combine a bunch of algorithms to improve model
    performance without knowing how it works or what value I bring to the company.

    on it and ignored other specialties such as Computer Vision, NLP, time-series,
    BI, and ML engineering.

    people with expertise in a certain field of data science or agile data scientists
    that can work on multiple tasks such as experiment tracking, business intelligence,
    reporting, and model deployment and monitoring.

    about new types of algorithms, especially reinforcement learning algorithms.

- en: Lack of knowledge about statistics and machine learning algorithms has caused
    me embarrassment during job interviews and at work. Moreover, I was walking blind,
    trying various things to come up with a solution without understanding how to
    improve the current model or process.

- en: I just wish that If I worked on the basics, I could have saved a lot of time
    and embarrassing situations. Furthermore, I could have gotten better jobs early,
    as companies are always looking for individuals who have a strong grip on deep
    learning algorithms and architectures.

    So, when you are starting your career, focus on math and programming. Both are
    essential for career success.'

    opportunities. You will always think that you're not good enough. So, you better
    start understating how many skills you have and your expertise. To do that, you
    can take assessment tests and certification exams, work on an open-source project,
    or participate in competitions.
