    of the "Free Must-Read Books" series, a third edition of quality (free!) books
    seemed like a good idea. In here you will find a few books on elementary machine
    learning, a few on general machine topics of interest such as feature engineering
    and model interpretability, an intro to deep learning, a book on Python programming,
    a pair of data visualizations entrants, and twin reinforcement learning efforts.

    to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty
    of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills
    to read those other books.

    predictors, to place these tools in the context of a good predictive modeling
    framework, and to convey our experience of utilizing these tools in practice.
    In the end, we hope that these tools and our experience will help you generate
    better models.

    How do they work under the hood? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How
    can their outputs be interpreted? This book will enable you to select and correctly
    apply the interpretation method that is most suitable for your machine learning
    project.

    tasks. Reading the book is recommended for machine learning practitioners, data
    scientists, statisticians, and anyone else interested in making machine learning
    models interpretable.

- en: You should look at your data. Graphs and charts let you explore and learn about
    the structure of the information you collect. Good data visualizations also make
    it easier to communicate your ideas and findings to other people. Beyond that,
    producing effective plots from your own data is the best way to develop a good
    eye for reading and understanding graphs—good and bad—made by others, whether
    presented in research articles, business slide decks, public policy advocacy,
    or media reports. This book teaches you how to do it.

- en: The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms,
    as well as to understand the algorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement
    learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications
    that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence
    to operations research or control engineering. In this book, we focus on those
    algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic
    programming. We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe
    the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by
    the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.

- en: The purpose of the book is to consider large and challenging multistage decision
    problems, which can be solved in principle by dynamic programming and optimal
    control, but their exact solution is computationally intractable. We discuss solution
    methods that rely on approximations to produce suboptimal policies with adequate
    performance. These methods are collectively referred to as reinforcement learning,
    and also by alternative names such as approximate dynamic programming, and neuro-dynamic
    programming.
