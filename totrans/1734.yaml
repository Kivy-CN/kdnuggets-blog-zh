    than you are, that you will never get hired or, if you already have been, that
    you are a mistake of the hiring process. Despite its statistical implausibility,
    most of us feel below average. Based on my conversations with colleagues, I estimate
    that 9 out of 10 of us suffer from imposter syndrome at one time or another. (If
    this sounds entirely unfamiliar to you, I recommend an introspective reading of
    “[Unskilled and unaware of it](https://github.com/brohrer/public-hosting/raw/master/kruger_dunning.pdf)”
    by Kruger and Dunning.)

- en: “Data science” is a term that has generated a lot of excitement and, like a
    magnet, has pulled in lots of nearby subfields. The field we call data science
    is still relatively young, yet already too broad for an individual to be an expert
    in every corner of it. In my experience, the master-of-all-trades data science
    unicorn is a mythical beast. None of us can cover all the bases. So how are we
    to proceed?

    and the tricks of using a tool. They will tell you that data cleaning is critical,
    but may not be able to enumerate the trade-offs between methods for replacing
    missing values. They will tell you that Spark is a good way to speed up your computations,
    but may not be able to advise you on the best settings to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A specialist does not necessarily know much about something that is outside
    their area. They will know the best architecture for running a linear regression
    on 500 million data points, but may not be able to explain a naive Bayes classifier.
    They will keenly grasp the trade-offs between square loss, hinge loss and logistic
    loss, but may be unable to query data from a Hive table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to describe generalists and specialists is “broad” versus “deep”.
    They are both technically savvy, but their expertise is distrubted differently.
    We are all part generalist and part specialist. As you evolve through your career,
    you get to find the mixture that works best for you.

- en: This distinction can be helpful when [hiring data scientists too](https://brohrer.github.io/stop_chasing_unicorns.html).
    Asking specifically for research experience in deep neural networks or a background
    in financial data visualization will draw applicants that fit your needs more
    effectively than calling for a "full-stack" data scientist.

    Unfortunately for most of us, there are few such degrees available in data science.
    We have no piece of paper to use as a shield when someone questions our qualifications.
    So what do we do instead? How can we answer our critics, or interviewers, our
    colleagues, and harshest of all, the voices in our head?

    kitchen. Three carpenters show up inquiring after the job. The first one presents
    you with a certificate. She says, “I apprenticed with the premier cabinet maker
    in the city for seven years.” The second opens her toolbox and says, “My chisels
    are of the latest design, and no one has a sharper plane.” The third hands you
    a small box, cherry-colored and perfectly smooth. When you pull the handle with
    a fingertip, a drawer slides out soundlessly. She says, “I made this.”

    I won’t argue that one is superior to another, but portfolios are particularly
    effective for data scientists. Certifications are few and not yet standardized.
    Listing algorithms and computer languages we have used doesn’t convey our depth
    of familiarity with them or what we can do with them. [Building things](https://brohrer.github.io/one_step_program_become_data_scientist.html) shows
    to a non-technical audience what we can do for them and demonstrates our expertise
    for technical interviewers and colleagues. Of course, this doesn’t guarantee that
    you’ll get a job on your first interview. But even if you don't, that’s normal. [Keep
    interviewing.](https://brohrer.github.io/get_data_science_job.html)

    This means that even real data scientists will spend most of their days feeling
    lost. Our project lead will ask us questions that we don't know the answer to.
    Colleagues will talk comfortably about algorithms we've never heard of. Teammates
    will write code that we can't begin to decipher. Articles will cite "hot" subfields
    that we didn't know existed. Archiv papers will throw around equations that may
    as well be hieroglyphic gibberish. Interns will point out fundamental flaws in
    our reasoning. This is OK. You're not doing it wrong. This is OK.
