    amount of tutorials and guides online on what you need to do to become a “good
    data scientist” or “how to land your dream data science role.” Not to mention
    the tons of certificates that you can get and free courses you can take to improve
    your skills. I have been where you are, overwhelmed by the amount of information
    out there about data science and how to get into the field. But, I always appreciated
    simple, straightforward articles that get to the point without dragging the topic
    too long.
