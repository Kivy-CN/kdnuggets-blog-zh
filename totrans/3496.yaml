- en: According to the most recent [KDnuggets data science software poll results](/2015/05/poll-r-rapidminer-python-big-data-spark.html),
    73% of data scientists used free software in the previous 12 months. While there
    are many sources of such tools on the internet, Github has become a *de facto*
    clearinghouse for all types of open source software, including tools used in the
    data science community. The importance, and central position, of machine learning
    to the field of data science does not need to be pointed out.

- en: The top project is, unsurprisingly, the go-to machine learning library for Pythonistas
    the world over, from industry to academia. [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
    leverages the Python scientific computing stack, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
    As general purpose a toolkit as there could be, Scikit-learn contains classification,
    regression, and clustering algorithms, as well as data-preparation and model-evaluation
    tools.

    The list is categorized by language, and further by machine learning category
    (general purpose, computer vision, natural language processing, etc.). It also
    includes data visualization tools, which opens it up as more of a generalized
    data science list in some sense... which is a good thing.

- en: '[PredictionIO](https://prediction.io/) is a general purpose framework. It includes
    several template engines for well-known tasks, such as classification and recommendation,
    which can be customized, connects to existing applications with REST APIs or SDKs,
    and includes supports for Spark MLib. Since it is built on top of Spark and utilizes
    its ecosystem, it should come as no surprise that PredictionIO is developed mainly
    in Scala.'

- en: This is a collection of IPython notebook tutorials for scikit-learn, as well
    as a number of links to related Python-specific and general machine learning topics,
    and more general data science information. The author isn't greedy either; they
    are quick to point out many other tutorials covering similar ground, in case this
    one doesn't tickle your fancy. The repo has no no software, but if you're new
    to Python machine learning, it may be worth checking out.
