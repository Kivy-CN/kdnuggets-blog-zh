    from fields like statistics, machine learning, Bayesian etc. They all aim to generate
    specific insights from the data. In this article, we are listing down some excellent
    data science books which cover the wide variety of topics under Data Science.

    to do Data Mining on large datasets. Often a very common problem a data scientist
    has to solve is to perform simple numerical tasks (which you can do by writing
    small pieces of programs) on a very large dataset. MMDS works exactly towards
    that. Added to that, you have topics like Dimensionality Reduction and Recommendation
    Systems which help you learn about the application of linear algebra and metric
    distances in the real world. An absolute must-read for all Data Scientists.
