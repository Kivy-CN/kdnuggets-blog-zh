    that you’re asking questions. Just because you have something in your mind that
    is an awesome idea for approaching the problem, does not mean that other people
    don’t similarly have awesome ideas that need to be heard an discussed. At the
    end of the day, data science typically functions as a support function to other
    areas of the business. Meaning we can’t just go rogue.

- en: Even the most seasoned data scientist will still find themselves creating a
    methodology or solution that isn’t in their area of expertise or is a unique use
    case of an algorithm that would benefit from the thoughts of other data subject
    matter experts. Often times the person listening to your proposed methodology
    will just give you the thumbs up, but when you’ve been staring at your computer
    for hours there is also a chance that you haven’t considered one of the underlying
    assumptions of your model or you’re introducing bias somewhere. Someone with fresh
    eyes can give a new perspective and save you from realizing your error AFTER you’ve
    presented your results.
  prefs: []

    you any favors. If anything, sharing your thoughts upfront and asking for feedback
    will help to ensure a successful outcome.

- en: Great questions are the ones that get asked. However, there is an art and science
    to asking good questions and also a learning process involved. Especially when
    you’re starting at a new job, ask everything. Even if it’s something that you
    believe you should already know, it’s better to ask and course-correct, than to
    not ask. You could potentially lose hours working on an analysis and then have
    your boss tell you that you misunderstood the request.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is helpful to also pose questions in a way that requires more than a “yes/no”
    response, so you can open up a dialogue and receive more context and information.
  prefs: []

    people feel judged by my questions. I have to reassure them that all I want is
    to understand how they work and what are their needs and that my intention is
    not to judge them or criticize them.*'

    off as judgement.  We definitely need to put on our “business acumen” hats on
    to the best of our ability to come across as someone who is genuinely trying to
    understand and deliver to their needs. I’ve found that if I can pose the question
    as “looking for their valuable feedback”, it’s a win-win for everyone involved.
  prefs: []

- en: As you build relationships with your team and stakeholders, this scenario is
    much less likely to occur. Once everyone realizes your personality and you’ve
    built a rapport, people will expect your line of questioning.

    gives you an opportunity to paraphrase the ask and gain consensus before moving

    feel like you’re really getting somewhere. Peeling back another layer of the onion
    if you will. You’re collaborating, you’re listening, you’re in the zone.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main takeaway here is that there are a TON of questions you need to ask
    to effectively produce something that the business wants. Once you start asking
    questions, it’ll become second nature and you’ll immediately see the value and
    find yourself asking even more questions as you gain more experience.
  prefs: []

- en: Questioning has been instrumental to my career. An additional benefit is that
    I’ve found my ‘voice’ over the years. I feel heard in meetings and my opinion
    is valued. A lot of this growth has come from getting comfortable asking questions
    and I’ve also learned a ton about a given business/industry through asking these
    questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve learned a lot about diversity of viewpoints and that people express information
    in different ways. This falls under the “business acumen” piece of data science
    that we’re not often taught in school. But I hope you can go forward and fearlessly
    ask a whole bunch of questions.
