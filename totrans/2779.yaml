    isn’t drastically affected by COVID-19\. In attempts to keep up with either precipitous
    constriction or massive immediate scaling, companies are seeing their tried and
    tested methods of interacting with their customers rendered almost meaningless.
    That means marketing personalization, lifetime value calculations, product recommendations,
    and churn models, are all inaccurate at best and misleading at worst.

- en: AI uses past actions to predict future events. And nothing in the (recent) past
    is anything like what we’re experiencing today. So AI is confused. It’s as though
    we’re all suddenly speaking a new language to Alexa or Siri or Google Assistant.
    Of course they wouldn’t “understand”. They’d be useless. Global purchase behavior
    is now speaking a different language. And AI doesn’t understand.

    in the trenches to make decisions about how to support rapidly changing customer
    demand. And they’re doing it largely without the AI they’re used to relying on
    because the models are not accurate anymore.

- en: We’re seeing companies going back to making business decisions based on recent
    data from dashboards in place of scalable, automated AI. And for good reason.
    In many cases, AI is useless because it’s never seen anything like COVID-19.

    through, and make actionable. Because it’s not enough to “discover” an insight.
    Companies need to act on the insightful information. And machines can do that
    at scale, company-wide. Humans cannot. So, things back up.

    systems working for them and their customers in this ever-changing environment.
    But before we get to this, it’s important to understand the specific hurdles they
    encounter.

    businesses are fairing, and how AI is working for them, given the current state
    of the world. The majority of executives and data scientists I talked to pointed
    towards the importance of spending more time looking at their data to understand
    how recent developments changed their business.

    way, everything has changed, and companies need to adapt. Reza Sohrabi from StitchFix
    points this out as well, “I don't think there are any businesses that are not
    impacted by the current pandemic. So, I believe companies have to adapt to the
    new situation and change gears as to how they do data science.”

    are unable to forecast future events, given current market and customer behavior
    fluctuations. Predictive models rely on historical data to predict future events.
    And when this historical data of customer behavior is nothing like what those
    customers are doing now, we have a problem. Predictions go to rubbish.

- en: '**Dive into your data** The most important objective for data-driven companies
    is to dive into data dashboards. Look at the major assumptions that are driven
    by your business objectives. Do they still hold up? Is there still data (or enough
    data) coming in to support these main objectives? For example, if you sell products,
    have the products that people are buying changed drastically? Is there inventory?
    How difficult is it for your customers to find the new set of products they suddenly
    want? Are your personalization tools still working?For example, are you sending
    out marketing messages that might be uninteresting or worse, embarrassing given
    the current state of the world? Or are your on-site recommendations still showing
    products that are suddenly irrelevant?'

    Your models that use data from six months ago to predict customer preferences
    are probably not accurate anymore. Instead, train these models on customer preferences
    from the past two to four weeks. Even though you might not have much sales data,
    it may give you a more accurate depiction of current customer needs, as the whole
    world was different six weeks ago. Also, there may be price sensitivity-related
    changes, so be sure you’re accounting for that too before you offer more expensive
    items.You’ll have to experiment with the amount of training data you use, but
    doing so will pay off as it’ll allow you to find the sweet spot where you include
    enough new trends while omitting old, irrelevant data.'

    Old messaging is dead. No one is purchasing or behaving the same today. This means
    your messages need to change to reflect the new concerns, hopes, and desires of
    your customers.One way to do this is by writing several options for new marketing
    copy and A/B testing them to see what resonates.If you have previously identified
    user segments, they may be the same, but even these may have changed. Trust nothing
    and prove everything with new evidence. The way to do that is by asking your customers
    or trying different approaches and quantifying the results. If you have an A/B
    system in place, use it now! What was working before has likely changed.'

    your customer segments. Are they the same or, more likely, have several segments
    merged into one or two new segments? Knowing this will help you tailor messages
    in these changing times.I’ve always been a big fan of reaching out to customers
    and asking them how their preferences may have changed. If the incentive is big
    enough (in other words, if they presume they’ll see wonderfully personalized offers,
    just for them), they’ll likely be willing to spend time helping you serve them
    better. Look to StitchFix and TrunkClub onboarding for a great example of how
    companies can ask for lots of user data with the promise of a highly personalized
    user experience.'

    at the moment. For example, the festival season is coming soon; normally, it would
    be reasonable to stock up on tents and recommend them to the youth. It would be
    unfortunate to do that now. Weights assigned to past actions must be reduced in
    a way that recommendations would rely mainly on trends of the last few weeks.
    As a buyer, what I see now that in some cases, recommender systems are partly
    shut down.” – Dániel Barta
