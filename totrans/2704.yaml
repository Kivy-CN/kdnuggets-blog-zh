    realized by now that achieving an accuracy of 80% isn’t too bad! But in the real
    world, 80% won’t cut it. In fact, most companies that I’ve worked for expect a
    minimum accuracy (or whatever metric they’re looking at) of at least 90%.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the biggest mistakes I see is how people handle missing values, and it’s
    not necessarily their fault. A lot of material on the web says that you typically
    handle missing values through **mean imputation, **replacing null values with
    the mean of the given feature, and this usually isn’t the best method.
  id: totrans-16

- en: For example, imagine we have a table showing age and fitness score and imagine
    that an eighty-year-old has a missing fitness score. If we took the average fitness
    score from an age range of 15 to 80, then the eighty-year-old will appear to have
    a much higher fitness score that they actually should.

    and fitness scores, we can model the relationship between age and fitness scores

    through feature engineering. Feature engineering is the process of transforming
    raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem that one is
    trying to solve. There’s no specific way to go about this step, which is what
    makes data science as much of an art as it as a science. That being said, here

    selection, which is choosing the most relevant/valuable features of your dataset.

    can cause your algorithm to underfit.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets
    of the original data. The model then selects the mode (the majority) of all of
    the predictions of each decision tree. What’s the point of this? By relying on
    a “majority wins” model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.

    0\. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the predicted value
    would be 1\. This is the power of ensemble learning!

    is adjusting the hyperparameters of your model. This is where it’s essential that
    you clearly understand the ML model that you’re working with. Otherwise, it can
    be difficult to understand each hyperparameter.
