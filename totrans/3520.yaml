    the market hype and have a potential to become a part of our daily life. The special
    report on emerging technologies is based on the assessment of maturity, duration
    for adoption, business benefit and future direction of more than 2,000 technologies,
    grouped into 112 areas.

    advancement, with all major automotive companies putting autonomous vehicles on
