    is due to simple syntax, a large community, and open-source contributors. Even
    on job boards, you will see recruiters looking for developers and data scientists
    who are good in Python, SQL, and R.

    about how Python is frustrating dealing with large datasets and machine learning
    applications. To achieve high performance, we have to use libraries that are written
    in other languages and use various packages to effectively implement parallel
    computing. He also explained how Julia will take over Python in a few years.

    calculations.
  prefs: []

    language that helps scientists and researchers to write code in the simplest way
    that is more close to the English language. Julia is cleaner than Python, especially
    for scientific computations.

    community means more learning resources for problem-solving. As you already know,
    Julia is quite a new language, and it has a smaller but enthusiastic community.
    If you encounter a unique issue, it will be harder for you to find a final solution
    online compared to Python.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both Julia and Python can run operations in parallel. For any application or
    solution, it is necessary to use all of the available resources (compute and memory)
    available. Julia inherently comes with parallel computing and better data management.
    Whereas in Python, you have to use various libraries to achieve high performance.
    In short, Julia has less top-heavy parallelization syntax than used in Python.

    you start learning Julia.
