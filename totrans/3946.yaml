    classic illustration of the power of brand is perfume - expensive perfumes may
    cost just a few dollars to produce but can be sold for more than $100 due to the
    cachet afforded by the brand.'

- en: David Malan's Computer Science course at Harvard, [CSCI E-50](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/intensive-introduction-computer-science),
    provides an interesting parallel in the education world. It's [available for free
    through EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022),
    or you can pay $75 for an EdX completion certificate (provided you successfully
    complete the course). Or you can pay $2200 and get Harvard credit.

- en: Here's the kicker - in all three cases, it's the same exact course experience
    for the student. The only difference, besides the price, is whether there is a
    credential, and, if so, the name of the organization issuing the credential.

- en: It's no secret that an Ivy League credential carries intangible value above
    and beyond the sheer quality of the education that lies behind it. The era of
    the MOOC provides a stark illustration of that brand premium -- given a fixed
    product, consumers seem willing to pay a 2800% premium for the Harvard name, as
    opposed to an EdX credential. A bit like perfume.
