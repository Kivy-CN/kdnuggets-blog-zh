    models](https://www.sigmoid.com/blogs/5-challenges-to-be-prepared-for-before-scaling-machine-learning-models/),
    we discussed the top five challenges in productionizing scalable Machine Learning
    (ML) models. Our focus for this piece is to establish the best practices that
    make an ML project successful.

- en: ML models today solve a wide variety of specific business challenges across
    industries. The method of choosing an ML model largely depends on the business
    use case that we are trying to solve. But before proceeding any further, we should
    ensure that the chosen approach to build the models are produtionizable.

    and integration challenging.**'

- en: Due to the complexities, the right risks have to be eliminated early off in
    the production process. Eliminating a higher number of risks at earlier Stages
    of the model selection & development leads to lesser rework during the productionizing
    stage.

- en: The various considerations involved in a machine learning ecosystem are — data
    sets, a technology stack, implementation and integrating these two, and teams
    who deploy the ML models. Then come the resilient testing framework to ensure
    consistent business results.

    sales uptick by productionizing their MAB models for personalised email marketing. **Watch

- en: To start, data feasibility should be checked — Do we even have the right data
    sets to run machine learning models on top? Do we get data fast enough to do predictions?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, restaurant chains(QSRs) with access to millions registered customers’
    data. This sheer volume is enough for any ML model to run on top of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the above data risks are mitigated, a data lake environment with easy and
    powerful access to a variety of required data sources should be set up. A data
    lake (in place of traditional warehouses) would save the team a lot of bureaucratic
    and manual overhead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Experimentation with the data sets to ensure that the data has enough information
    to bring about the desired business change is crucial at this step. Also, a scalable
    computing environment to process the available data in a fast manner is a primary
    requirement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the data scientists have cleaned up, structured, and processed the different
    data sets, we strongly advise cataloging the data for leveraging in the future.
  prefs: []

- en: In the end, a strong and well-thought governance and security system should
    be put in place so that different teams in the organization can share the data
    freely.

- en: '**2\. Evaluation of the right tech stack**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the ML models are chosen, they should be run manually to test their validity.
    For instance, in the case of personalized email marketing – Are the promotion
    emails that are being sent bringing in new conversions or do we need to rethink
    our strategy?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Upon successful manual tests, the right technology has to be chosen. The data
    science teams should be allowed to choose from a range of technology stacks so
    that they can experiment and pick up the one that makes ML productionizing easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The technology chosen should be benchmarked against stability, the business
    use case, future scenarios, and cloud readiness. [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-11-13-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-17-percent-in-2020) states
    that cloud IaaS is projected to grow at 24% YoY until 2022.

- en: Standardizing the deployment process so that the testing and integration at
    different points become smooth is highly recommended.
  prefs: []

- en: Data engineers should focus on polishing the codebase, integrating the model
    (as an API endpoint or a bulk process model), and creating workflow automation
    so teams can integrate easily.

    for any ML model’s success.

- en: The right frameworks for logging, monitoring, and reporting the results would
    make the otherwise difficult testing process manageable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ML environment should be tested in real-time and monitored closely. In a
    sophisticated experimentation system, test results should be sent back to the
    data engineering teams so that they can update the models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the data engineers can decide to overweight the variants that over-perform
    in the next iteration while underweighting the underperforming variants.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Negative or wildly wrong results should also be watched out for. The right SLAs
    need to be met. The data quality and model performance should be monitored.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: '**5\. Change management & communication**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every ML model’s success hugely depends on clear communication between the various
    cross-functional teams involved so that risks are mitigated at the right step.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data engineering and data science teams would have to [*work together*](https://www.sigmoid.com/productionize-ml-models/) to
    put an ML model into production. Data scientists are advised to have full control
    over the system to check in code and see production results. Teams might even
    have to be trained for new environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Transparent communication would save everyone effort and time in the end.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to all the above best practices in place, the machine learning model
    should be designed to be reusable and resilient to changes and drastic events. The
    best-case scenario is not to have all the recommended methods in place but to
    make specific areas enough mature and scalable so that they can be calibrated
    up and down as per the time and the business requirement.
