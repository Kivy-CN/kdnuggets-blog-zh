    a few years before you consider transitioning or moving onto another role. There
    is a difference in the level of experience compared to Junior, Mid-Level, and
    Senior Data Scientists. This article will go through the expectations for all
    job roles and what is required to move up the ladder.

- en: Most people will look at the Data Scientists' skills, years of experience, level
    of education, expertise, management skills, and more. A good understanding of
    how to differentiate the difference between the different levels of Data Scientists
    is the understanding of how long you can leave the Data Scientist alone to complete/handle
    a task without having to check in on them.

    a task without checking in?”, we can break the different levels as follows:'

    a day. They will do a lot of pair programming with Mid-level and Senior Data Scientists.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Mid-level Data Scientist**: You will check in with them weekly or a couple
    of times a month, however, they should be capable. They will also undergo pair
    programming with Senior Data Scientists, and advise and guide Junior Data Scientists
    if required.'

    knowledge and experience one possesses to be able to get things done. A Junior
    Data Scientist may reach a point where they are blocked and have no idea of getting
    past it, without consulting with a senior. A Mid-level Data Scientist may also
    face difficulties, however, they will have a better grasp of how to overcome it
    on their own. Whereas a Senior Data Scientist has enough experience under their
    belt to be able to get things done. Even if this includes hiring experts or researchers,
    they know what is required to complete a project.

- en: If you are looking for a Senior job, ask yourself “how long could someone leave
    me alone to complete/handle a task without checking in”. You have to be completely
    honest with yourself, if not you will be setting yourself up for failure. I am
    not saying you can’t set goals and strive to be the greatest you can be. I am
    saying be realistic with your current level of experience to help you find the
    correct role, and continuously build from there.

- en: Reflecting on the question “how long could you leave someone alone to complete/handle
    a task without checking in?”, it’s all based on being independent. Juniors tend
    to ask more questions due to a lack of experience and skills, whereas Seniors
    have the ability to make decisions based on past experiences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This should not scare you from asking questions. There is nothing wrong with
    asking questions, that is how you learn. If you don’t make mistakes, you don’t
    have to go through a learning process, and you will always remain stagnant. However,
    don’t be reliant on your colleagues and senior staff to direct you every time.
    Avoid going to them straight away when you have a question, try to figure it out
    for yourself. You will feel a sense of accomplishment when you understand how
    to fix the problem. If you are unsure of your solution, ask your manager for his/her
    opinion. They will appreciate the fact that you came to them with a solution,
    rather than just a problem.

    an uncomfortable and unfamiliar hole. Juniors typically work on easier tasks,
    sometimes very repetitive and boring. If you feel like you are ready, ask your
    manager for more challenging tasks to learn and grow your analytical skills.

- en: Senior Data Scientists can handle tasks alone, not only because of their level
    of experience but also due to their understanding of the businesses’ goals. The
    majority of Junior Data Scientists tasks are isolated and the process of completing
    a task does not go further than it being a request. Being able to look at the
    bigger picture by having a better grasp of the businesses’ short-term and long-term
    goals will improve your way of thinking when dealing with a request or trying
    to solve a problem.

    but also the needs of the company to help it grow. Learning how Senior Data Scientists
    approach and handle problems through pair programming, weekly team builds or 1-1’s
    will get you in the Senior Data Scientist mindset.

- en: These are the major soft skills for a Mid-level or Senior Data Scientist, as
    they will be frequently asked for advice, direction, and help to understand a
    problem. Many Junior Data Scientists are not required to speak to many colleagues
    apart from other members of the data team and their managers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being able to manage a data team as a Senior Data Scientist requires good communication
    and management skills, to make sure the operations are run smoothly. If there
    is an issue with a project that was managed by a Senior Data Scientist regardless
    if the task was completed by him/her; they will still have to take responsibility.
    The Senior Data Scientist should be vigilant to identify the error before it is
    presented to stakeholders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a Senior lacks communication, his/her operations will fall apart, and will
    soon realise that the workload will fall onto them due to their incompetence.
    Rather than having to explain to stakeholders why the outputs are wrong or why
    the wrong decisions were made, managing and communicating with your data team
    to avoid these problems is the better solution.
