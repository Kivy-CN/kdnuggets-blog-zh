- en: Generative AI is algorithms used to create new and unique content, such as text,
    audio, code, images, and more. With the development of AI, Generative AI has the
    potential to take over various industries helping them with tasks that people
    thought were once upon a time impossible.

    The fashion industry can potentially use generative AI to create new designs for
    their next line. Interior designers can use generative AI to build someone their
    dream home within days, rather than weeks and months.

    itself. However, applications such as ChatGPT have set the bar high and we should
    expect to see more innovative applications getting released in the coming years.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The diffusion model is designed to learn the underlying structure of a dataset
    by mapping it to a lower-dimensional latent space. Latent diffusion models are
    a type of deep generative neural network, developed by the CompVis group at LMU
    Munich and Runway.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The diffusion process is when you slowly add or diffuse noise to the compressed
    latent representation, and generate an image that is just noise. However, the
    diffusion model goes in the opposite direction and does the reverse process of
    diffusion. The noise is gradually reduced from the image in a controlled way,
    so the image slowly appears to look like the original.

    accurate visualizations, define images better, and detect diagnostics at a faster
    rate. For example, using tools such as illustrations-to-photo conversion through
    GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) has allowed healthcare professionals to
    have a more in-depth understanding of a patient's current medical state.

    want. However, it was a matter of time before someone came in and created fixed
    regulations around AI. Many are concerned about the supervision of generative

    export accurate outputs. Data privacy is a challenge that all AI companies and
    tools are facing due to the potential misuse of sensitive information.

    has been created by generative AI are still an open discussion. Some may say that
    the content is unique, whereas others may say the text-generated content has been
    paraphrased from a variety of internet sources.

    the number one concern would be to investigate the quality of the data and then
    the accuracy of the output that has been generated. Fields such as medicine are
    areas of high concern as dealing with misinformation can be highly impactful.

    possible bias present in the training data. This can lead to discriminatory outputs,

    different cultural backgrounds. For us common sense when speaking with someone
