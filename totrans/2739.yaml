- en: The summer school on Resource-aware Machine Learning provides lectures on the
    latest research in machine learning, typically with the twist on resource consumption
    and how these can be reduced. This year’s summer school will be held online and
    free of charge between 31st of August and 4th of September. The events will be
    a mixture of pre-recorded and live sessions, including a dedicated space for presenting
    PhD/PostDoc research and a hackathon featuring real world ML tasks.

- en: As a practical example to leverage your ML skills we host a challenge on indoor
    location prediction based on floor-integrated sensor data. Real world data is
    gathered in a warehouse scenario, where free roaming robots perform transportation
    of goods. Your first task will be to use sensor data (vibration, magnetic fields…)
    with position ground truth to build a position prediction. The best teams will
    get the chance for live control of the robots on the final day of the summer school.
    The winner will be invited for research cooperations to Dortmund.
