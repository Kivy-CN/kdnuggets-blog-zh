    language for data science. In my opinion, most people are wrong. Amidst the hunt
    for the newest, the sexiest, the most container-able data science language, people
    are looking for the wrong thing.

    humble Structured Query Language, or SQL, is my pick for the language to learn
    for data science. All those other languages certainly have their place, but SQL
    is the one non-negotiable language that I consider a base requirement for anyone
    working in data science. Here’s why.

    working with data science, you’re working with databases. And if you’re working
    with databases, you’re probably working with SQL.
  prefs: []

    Imagine someone told you that if you just learned a specific language, you’d be
    able to speak to and understand every single person on Earth. How valuable would
    that be? SQL is that language in data science, the language that everyone uses
    to manage and access databases.

    will need SQL. As long as you know [how to write a SQL query](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/best-practices-to-write-sql-queries-how-to-structure-your-code/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+sql+for+ds),

    Indeed, certain data is now more commonly stored in non-relational databases,
    such as by key-value pairs or graph data. It’s true that there are benefits to
    storing data like that – you gain more scalability and flexibility. But there’s
    no standard NoSQL query language. You might learn one for one job, and then need
    to learn an entirely new one for a new job.

    stat about how data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning. While it’s not
    true, I think if you ask any data scientist what they spend time on, data cleaning
    will rank in the top five tasks. That’s why this section is the longest.

    unique advantages for certain aspects of data cleaning and processing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL's expressive query language allows data scientists to efficiently filter,
    sort, and aggregate data using concise statements. This level of flexibility is
    especially useful when dealing with large datasets where manual data manipulation
    would be time-consuming and error-prone. Compare that to a language like Python,
    where achieving similar data manipulation tasks might require writing more lines
    of code and dealing with loops, conditions, and external libraries. While Python
    is renowned for its versatility and rich ecosystem of data science libraries,
    SQL's focused syntax can **expedite routine data cleaning operations**, enabling
    data scientists to swiftly prepare data for analysis.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Plus, any data scientist will complain about the bane of their existence: **missing
    values**. SQL''s functions and capabilities for handling missing values—such as
    using [COALESCE](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/sql-coalesce-function-a-guide-for-postgresql-users/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+sql+for+ds),
    CASE, and NULL handling—provide straightforward approaches to address gaps in
    data without the need for complex programming logic.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other bane of a data scientist’s existence is **duplicates**. Happily, SQL
    offers efficient methods to identify and eliminate duplicate records from datasets,
    like the `DISTINCT` keyword and the `[GROUP BY](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/what-is-sql-group-by-and-how-to-use-it/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+sql+for+ds)`
    clause.

    transformation pipelines**, which take raw or semi-processed data and convert
    it into a format suitable for analysis. This is particularly beneficial for automating
    and standardizing that repetitive data-cleaning processes we all know and hate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL's ability to **join tables** from different databases or files streamlines
    the process of merging data for analysis is essential for projects involving data
    integration or aggregating data from diverse origins. Which, for a data scientist,
    comprises a majority of projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, I like to remind people that data science does not happen in a vacuum.
    SQL queries are self-contained and can be easily shared with colleagues. This
    fosters **collaboration** and ensures that others can reproduce data cleaning
    steps without manual intervention.

    SQL integrates perfectly well with any other of the top data science languages
    like R, Python, Julia, or Rust. You get all the benefits of analysis, data viz,
    and machine learning while still retaining SQL’s strength for data manipulation.

    processing I talked about earlier. You can use SQL to preprocess and clean data
    directly within databases, and then lean on Python, R, Julia, or Rust to perform
    more advanced data transformations or feature engineering, leveraging the extensive
    libraries available.

    who know how to use SQL – to generate reports, dashboards, and visualizations
    that inform decision-making. Familiarity with SQL enables data scientists to produce
    meaningful reports directly from databases. And because SQL is so widespread,
    these reports are usually compatible and interoperable across almost any system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of how interoperable it is with reporting tools and scripting languages
    like Python, R, and JavaScript, data scientists can actually automate the reporting
    processes, seamlessly combining SQL's data extraction and manipulation capabilities
    with the visualization and reporting features of these languages. The upshot is
    you get comprehensive and insightful reports that effectively communicate data-driven
    insights to stakeholders, all inside one place.
