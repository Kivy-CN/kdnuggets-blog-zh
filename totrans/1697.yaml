    training and validation. While a lot of work usually goes into cleaning up data
    sources for modeling, such as dealing with missing attributes, there’s often larger
    issues with the underlying data set that need to be correctly in order for the
    trained models to actually be representative. One of the goals of data governance
    is data integrity, which involves validating that your underlying assumptions
    about the data set match reality. An example showing why this aspect of data science
    is so important is the recent [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-used-broadband-data-we-shouldnt-have-heres-what-went-wrong/),
    where they identified that previous conclusions published about broadband access
    were invalid due to using a flawed data set.

    because companies are using large and complex data sets from a variety of internal
    and external sources. One of the key functions of this role is to perform analysis
    and validation of data sets in order to build confidence in the underlying data
    sets. We want to build trust in our data sets before we use them as input to our
    models, where the outputs are visible to customers. At [Windfall](https://angel.co/windfall-data),
    we use a variety of different public and proprietary data sources as input to
    our net worth models. We’re hiring for a [governance data scientist](https://angel.co/windfall-data/jobs/295441-data-scientist-governance)
    role focused on aspects such as data integrity, to ensure that we are using validated
    data sets in our modeling processes.

- en: One of the key challenges when using data sets is determining the validity of
    the data. Often data is stale or sampled in a way that is not representative of
    the overall population.If you’re using a data source that is several years old,
    many conclusions that could be drawn from the data may no longer hold true. For
    example, using data about broadband connectivity in 2010 would be problematic
    when determining the impact of repealing net neutrality on US households today.
    In the case of the FiveThirtyEight article, a sampled data set was used where
    the distribution of broadband subscribers significantly varied from other data
    sources analyzed.

- en: In order to question underlying assumptions about data, it’s often necessary
    to audit the data against different sources. For example, transaction-level data
    provided by the FEC about political contributions can be compared with aggregate
    amounts reported from campaigns, and estimates of housing values can be compared
    to estimates from Zillow and Redfin. A governance role will prioritize which data
    points to manually inspect, in order to build more confidence in the data sets,
    and make sure that conclusions reached from a sample data set can be applied to
    a wider population.

- en: Another aspect of this role is determining how to resolve issues with data sets
    when they are discovered. In the case of incorrect findings being published, a
    postmortem should be published explaining how the findings change based on the
    newly discovered information, and the FiveThirtyEight article is a great example
    of this. But if the input data is instead used for modeling, then the role should
    work with an engineering team to resolve these issues in the data pipeline.

    transactions, where properties at multiple addresses are purchased as part of
    the same transaction. Handling these types of transactions required adding new
    rules to our automated valuation model (AVM) calculations. Much like productizing
    a model, a governance data scientist should be capable of putting data quality
    fixes into production. This can involve handing off a script, or submitting PRs
    with code changes.

- en: An additional function that we are defining for a governance role is to evaluate
    if new data sources are worth using for modeling purposes. At Windfall, this means
    determining if adding a new data source will improve the accuracy of our net worth
    models. A data scientist in this role should be able to work with third party
    data in a variety of data formats and types of sources, and perform exploratory
    analysis on the data. Often the goal of exploring a new data set is to test for
    correlations between attributes in different data sets, and data scientists need
    to be able to work effectively with disparate data sources.

    predictive modeling, but instead focused on improving data quality and integrity.
    It also differs form product analytics roles, because the goal is to identify
    discrepancies in the underlying data rather than business metrics. Despite these
    differences, the role still requires the statistical knowledge, domain expertise,
    and hacking skills commonly associated with data science.
