    deep learning platform for training big deep learning models over large datasets.
    It is designed with an intuitive programming model based on the layer abstraction.
    A variety of popular deep learning models are supported, namely feed-forward models
    including convolutional neural networks (CNN), energy models like restricted Boltzmann
    machine (RBM), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Many built-in layers are provided
    for users.'

    that makes it easy for developers of all skill levels to use machine learning
    technology. Amazon Machine Learning provides visualization tools and wizards that
    guide you through the process of creating machine learning (ML) models without
    having to learn complex ML algorithms and technology.  It connects to data stored
    in Amazon S3, Redshift, or RDS, and can run binary classification, multiclass
    categorization, or regression on said data to create a model.'

    to create and train models, then turn them into APIs that can be consumed by other
    services. Users get up to 10GB of storage per account for model data, although
    you can also connect your own Azure storage to the service for larger models.
    A wide range of algorithms are available, courtesy of both Microsoft and third
    parties. You don’t even need an account to try out the service; you can log in
    anonymously and use Azure ML Studio for up to eight hours.'

    with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by the Berkeley
    Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu/)) and by community
    contributors. [Yangqing Jia](http://daggerfs.com/) created the project during
    his PhD at UC Berkeley. Caffe is released under the [BSD 2-Clause license](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/LICENSE).
     Models and optimization are defined by configuration without hard-coding & user
    can switch between CPU and GPU. Speed makes Caffe perfect for research experiments
    and industry deployment. Caffe can process over 60M images per day with a single
    NVIDIA K40 GPU.'

    to the library’s creators. Implementing mlpack can be done through a cache of
    command-line executables for quick-and-dirty, “black box” operations, or with
    a C++ API for more sophisticated work. Mlpack provides these algorithms as simple
    command-line programs and C++ classes which can then be integrated into larger-scale
    machine learning solutions.'

    — for math and science work. The resulting libraries can be used either for interactive
    “workbench” applications or be embedded into other software and reused. The kit
    is available under a BSD license, so it’s fully open and reusable. Scikit-learn includes
    tools for many of the standard [machine-learning *tasks*](http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/09/gaining-access-to-the-best-machine-learning-methods.html) (such

    fed to the cluster, and a REST API allows the trained model to be used in production
    immediately. It focuses on performance and flexibility. It has little hard-coded
    entities and enables training of all the widely recognized topologies, such as
    fully connected nets, convolutional nets, recurent nets etc.'
