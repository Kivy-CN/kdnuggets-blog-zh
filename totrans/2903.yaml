    hottest topics. The best minds participate in AI research, the largest corporations
    allocate astronomical sums for the development of competencies in this area, and
    AI startups collect multibillion-dollar investments annually.

    is given by François Chollet in his book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python):
    “the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. As such,
    AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and deep learning, but
    also includes many more approaches that don’t involve any learning”.'

    which was created in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. This program
    could maintain a long dialogue with a person, but could not learn new words or
    correct its behavior during a dialogue. The behavior of ELIZA was to be specified
    explicitly using a special programming language.

    with the works of Alan Turing and the Dartmouth workshop, which brought together
    the first enthusiasts of this field and in which the basic principles of the science
    of AI were formulated. Further, this industry experienced several cycles of a
    surge of interest and subsequent recessions (the so-called “AI winters”), in order
    to become one of the key areas of world science today.

    A strong AI can think and be aware of itself as a separate person. Weak AI is
    deprived of such abilities and simply performs a certain range of tasks (plays
    chess, recognizes cats in images or [draws a picture for $432,500](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamfalcon/2018/10/25/what-happens-now-that-an-ai-generated-painting-sold-for-432500/#5df73f2ea41c)).

    very useful artificial intelligence.

    is the ability to learn. For AI, a family of machine learning models is responsible

    learning based on examples of data and corresponding results finds patterns in

    neurons so as to give the greatest weight to the neurons that make the most impact

    meowing, then it is probably a cat. At the same time, we assign the maximum weight
    to the meow parameter. So if the animal is not striped and not fluffy, but meows
    - it is still likely a cat.

    hope, having read this article, you already know the answer to this question.
    Artificial intelligence is a general area of automation of intellectual tasks
    (such as reading, [playing Go](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/alphago-beats-planets-best-human-go-player-ke-jie/),
    image recognition, and creating self-driving cars). Machine learning is a set
    of artificial intelligence methods that are responsible for the ability of an
    AI to learn. Deep learning is a subclass of machine learning methods that study
    multi-layer neural networks.
