    as they assist in code generation, comprehension, item search, and performing
    various tasks using prompts or code. Even cloud IDE platforms like Google Colab
    and Deepnote offer AI-assisted coding that can help you generate code and resolve
    issues.

    out. They all come with VSCode extensions and are easy to set up. All you need
    to do is install them and start experiencing the newer and easier way of developing
    programs.

- en: '[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is a tool that uses artificial
    intelligence to help programmers write code more efficiently. By installing the
    Copilot extension in VS Code, developers can generate code, learn from the code,
    autocomplete, and configure their editor.'

- en: Copilot is a mature product that provides the latest and most accurate suggestions
    compared to other tools. With the new chat feature, developers can generate, modify,
    and improve code on the go by using the natural language. Furthermore, the inline
    chat allows you to generate code directly in the text editor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only downside of GitHub Copilot is that it is a paid tool. However, if you
    are a full-time developer or software engineer, paying $10 per month is a bargain.

    popularity recently. It offers most of the features that GitHub Copilot provides,
    and the best part is, it''s free of cost for individuals.'

    and provide you with context-aware answers. Additionally, you can ask it to refactor,
    explain, improve, and resolve errors in the code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also includes autocomplete, but I'd suggest that you stick to your old Python
    autocomplete as Codeium's autocomplete isn't always accurate. However, the only
    downside of Codeium is that it may not always generate the latest version of the
    code.

    aims to help you write and understand code faster. It offers similar features
    to Codeium, such as chat, commands, code explanations, and autocomplete. It''s
    available in both free and pro versions.'

- en: I have been using Cody for nearly two months now and it's been a smooth journey,
    until I started using it for my data and machine learning projects. Unfortunately,
    I've noticed that it's not context-aware, and as a result, produces inaccurate
    code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, in my personal experience using Codeium and Cody, I've found that Cody
    sometimes fails to understand the code and produces inaccurate autocomplete suggestions.
    That's why I prefer Codeium over Cody.

    and I was impressed by how it integrates any state-of-the-art large language model
    and offers a wide range of features. This extension provides AI chat assistance,
    code explanation, error-checking, auto-completion, and much more. If you have
    access to OpenAI API or any other platform, you can use this extension for free.'

    API is fast, I was not impressed with its accuracy. To make it more usable, developers
    need to work on reducing the lag in autocomplete and fixing the issue of generating
    wrong answers. One possible solution is to use Codeium for autocomplete and CodeGPT
    for code generation and issue resolution.

    the Pro version. If you want to experience better coding assistance, it may be
    worth investing in the Pro version. However, the free version's autocomplete function
    is still quite fast and accurate.
