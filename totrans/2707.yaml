    support vector machines. Finally, the coursework will explore the inner workings
    of neural networks and how to construct and adapt neural networks for various
    types of data. | 3.5 months, 6-9 hours a week | $3600 |'

    | master the ability to analyze and visualize data in meaningful ways using Python
    to help solve complex business problems. Working with tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,
    NumPy, and Pandas, you will have the opportunity to analyze real-world datasets
    to identify patterns and relationships in data. You will gain experience using
    both built-in and custom-built data types to create expressive and computationally
    robust data science projects. Finally, you will build predictive machine learning
    models using Python and scikit-learn. | 5 months, 3-5 hours a week | $3600 |'

    | You''ll learn techniques for manipulating and visualizing data, describing data
    through descriptive statistics, and clustering. You''ll extend these basic reporting
    approaches through classification and predictive analytics using traditional parametric
    models (regression and logistic regression) as well as machine learning techniques.
    In addition, you''ll develop linear, nonlinear, and Monte Carlo decision-making
    models that will allow you to make more informed decisions. | ~72 hours | $3600

    | You will begin this certificate by examining different data types and how they
    are expressed within Tableau. As you become more familiar with Tableau, you will
    practice building basic visualizations based on standard analysis and audience
    evaluation. As the courses progress, you will move beyond basic analysis, incorporating
    critique and feedback to introduce you to the iterative process of visualization.
    Ultimately, you''ll come away with the confidence to use your data visualization
    skills to tell a compelling story. | 2 Months | $3600 |'
