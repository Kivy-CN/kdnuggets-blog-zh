- en: Since completing my Masters in Data Science, I have had a number of people contact
    me asking for my experience with the course and whether it is worth recommending.
    Therefore, I thought it best to summarise my decision for starting the course,
    what I have achieved during my studies, and the outcome in the years following.

- en: It was the spring of 2016 and I was coming towards the end of a 6 month internship
    at one of the largest consulting firms in the City of London. I had taken this
    role to gain experience and figure out whether becoming an Actuary was the correct
    route for my career. I quickly found passion in the data analytics of the role
    as I was being pulled into meetings to discuss numbers I had crunched or was able
    hack together a tool to automate previously manual tasks. However, I also found
    that the traditional track I would be heading on if I moved onto the graduate
    scheme no longer interested me due to years of standardised exams and little to
    no creativity. Furthermore, most of my work at this point was within Excel and
    I was gaining little to no coding experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It was at this point I also started to explore a magical term that kept coming
    up in my job searches: *Data Science*. I had come from a background in mathematics
    and, due to the nature of the job market in the UK, had been nudged towards the
    well-founded traditional roles such as accountancy and actuarial consulting. And
    yet, here was a new role that defied all the expectations I had set for myself
    of my future career. Where becoming an Actuary I would be solving problems by
    learning regulatory standards, Data Scientists are encouraged to creatively find
    solutions that fit within the commercial environment. Furthermore, the role opportunities
    were no longer fixed into a few select firms but almost all companies were looking
    for some variation of a Data Scientist and the idea that I could move into a completely
    new industry, from fashion to finance, greatly appealed to my interests.'

    that **I was lacking two key skills: applying Machine Learning and coding.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What were my options?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first solution was to simply teach these myself, I had the statistical experience
    to learn machine learning and had done enough coding in MatLab to feel confident
    that I could learn Python or R. However, if I was to do these I was unsure if
    this was enough and how I would clearly demonstrate my newly acquired skills on
    a CV to employers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I considered online boot camps but they were often fixed in their content and
    I was unsure of how repeating someone else’s work would be received by employers.
    Furthermore, there was no guarantee that these were credible to employers and
    were expensive to self fund. Today, only three years later, the list of courses
    supported by universities makes this much more of a viable option and is something
    that is definitely worth considering but at the time these were lacking. Unfortunately,
    boot camps were a costly risk that I was uncertain would pay off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, I decided to look for the options available at universities. At the
    time there were two types of courses that fit within my goals; business analysts
    courses and computer science machine learning. The former focused on applying
    analytics within commercial environments but, as this was run through business
    schools, was far more expensive at over £25,000 for one year of studying. The
    latter provided the teaching through academic research and focused more on teaching
    the underlying theory than the application. Furthermore, as this was an academic
    course run through the Computer Science department, the cost was considerably
    less for the year at £9,000 (for UK citizen).

- en: In the end, I decided to play it safe and commit a full year to the academic
    masters in the hope that I would gain the applied knowledge in machine learning
    and develop my coding skills through project work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, I joined the 2016/17 cohort of the Data Science MSc at City, University
    of London’s Computer Science department. This was the second year the course was
    offered at this university and, at the time, was the only university in London
    that offered a Data Science Masters (though others had some variations of this).

- en: 'The first term consisted of the three main topics of Data Science: fundamentals
    of data science, machine learning and visualisations. Each module consisted of
    a coursework component that we were given a choice of any publicly available dataset
    to apply our newly learned methods on. With these, I was quickly able to improving
    my coding skills and even built the confidence to start sharing [these projects
    publicly](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2017/06/27/test/).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second term we had two core modules, Big Data and Neural Computing, and
    were given the choice of two optional modules. The list of options was comprehensive
    and enabled us to pick specialisms from computer vision to data architectures.
    I chose Data Visualisations (a continuation of the first term’s module) and Software
    Agents (the basics of AI by applying Reinforcement Learning). Again, these modules
    included coursework and with the fundamentals from the first term, I was really
    able to expand my applications and think creatively. Big Data also introduced
    text data and natural language processing.

- en: Over the two terms, I had been given a broad overview of most of the Data Science
    topics and had a deep knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks from the
    core modules. As we moved into the first component of the course, the dissertation,
    we were given the choice to complete this whilst in an internship role (and be
    provided an extension on the deadline to account for balancing whilst working).
    I found a suitable role, defined my research topic and over the following months
    applied all the skills I had gained so far towards [applying AI within business](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2018/03/09/masters-thesis-summary-constructing-a-narrative-using-markov-decision-processes-applied-to-data-visualisations/).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I had two goals to achieve; to demonstrate that I understand machine learning
    and apply these with coding. The course not only provided a clear ‘box tick’ against
    these on my CV but enabled me to continue to expand my skills after with more
    and more interesting projects. Part of any job application is to get past the
    initial checks and I was now doing this much more consistently. Furthermore, as
    I moved into interview stages, I had all these project to discuss and truly demonstrate
    confidence in my understanding far more than I would have achieved on my own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Masters opened up all the doors that I had previously been knocking on and
    even had recruiters contacting me directly following the projects I had posted
    publicly. In the end, I found that I enjoyed the research aspect of my dissertation
    and the freedom to pursue the field and have since move onto a PhD in Artificial
    Intelligence. Ironically, this is the last thing I would have considered back
    in 2016 but as the field is constantly expanding it is incredible to be at the
    forefront of this, particularly because many problems require an applied mindset
    and fit within commercial problems and are not simply theoretical.
