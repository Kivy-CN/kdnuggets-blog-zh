- en: Metalearning is an imperative concept when it comes to learning. It is the first
    step every person must take before initiating the learning process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning is harder than it sounds, as many people think learning is just absorbing
    information at random, then spewing it out in a test.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in reality, learning is tough. I say this because schools and colleges have
    turned into a business, and the act of learning has become a lost art. Students
    are merely studying to pass a test and no longer learning for the sake of learning.
    Ask a student “why” instead of “what” and they’ll likely struggle.

    This phrase usually implies that one should think of the future, or think of other
    parallel factors, and not emphasizing the small details.

    to data science. Data Science is the sexiest job of the 21st century. But most
    data scientists jump into the field without thinking clearly about what data science
    is all about.

    communication to be able to translate data into something that people can understand
    and comprehend well. To be a data scientist is almost like a translator of the
    messy data in the world.
  prefs: []

    that play a huge role in data science, machine learning concepts (which usually

    the ebbs and flow of life. One piece of advice for communication is to just use
    simple words instead of jargon so that all can understand the results of your
