- en: After my [last post](http://willmcginnis.com/2015/11/04/apache-machine-learning-data-analysis-projects/)
    about the breadth of big-data / machine learning projects currently in Apache,
    I decided to experiment with some of the bigger ones.  This post serves as a minimal
    guide to getting started using the brand-brand new python API into Apache Flink.
     Flink is a very similar project to Spark at the high level, but underneath it
    is a true streaming platform (as opposed to Spark’s small and fast batch approach
    to streaming).  This gives rise to a number of interesting use cases where massive
    velocity and volume of data needs to be processed quickly and in complex ways.

    and a collection of libraries.

- en: With version 1.0 of Flink, a python API will be available, again, similarly
    to Spark. While it is present in pre-1.0 releases, there are known bugs present
    that make its use difficult or impossible.  So to start with, we need to build
    the master branch (unless you are reading this since the v1.0 release, if that’s
    the case just follow [Flink’s](https://flink.apache.org/) instructions to build).

    in the flink directory.  You can start up Flink with the commands.

    in Apache Flink.   The code is up here: [https://github.com/wdm0006/flink-python-examples](https://github.com/wdm0006/flink-python-examples),
    and I will add in more advanced examples both in the repo and explained here as
    we move along.
