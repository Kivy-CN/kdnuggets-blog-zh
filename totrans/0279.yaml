    define data mining as "the application of specific algorithms for extracting patterns
    from data." This demonstrates that, in data mining, the emphasis is on the application
    of algorithms, as opposed to on the algorithms themselves. We can define the relationship
    between machine learning and data mining as follows: data mining is a **process**,
    during which machine learning algorithms are utilized as **tools** to extract
    potentially-valuable patterns held within datasets.'

    science. Before the explosion of the term data science, in fact, data mining enjoyed
    much greater success as a Google search term. Having a look at Google Trends stretching
    back a further 5 years than those shown in the above graphic, data mining was
    once much more popular. Today, however, data mining seems to be split as a concept
    between machine learning and data science itself. If one was to endorse the above
    explanation, that data mining is a *process*, then it makes sense to view data
    science as both a superset of data mining as well as a successor term.

    dramatic uptick in online searches of late. Enjoying a surge in research and industry,
    due mainly to its incredible successes in a number of different areas, deep learning
    is the process of applying deep neural network technologies - that is, neural
    network architectures with multiple hidden layers - to solve problems. Deep learning
    is a process, like data mining, which employs deep neural network architectures,
    which are particular types of machine learning algorithms.

    intelligence difficult to put their finger on. I am not an artificial intelligence
    researcher, and so my answer here may wildly differ from someone who is, or may
    even upset folks in other fields. I have philosophized on the idea of AI a lot
    over the years, and I have come to the conclusion that artificial intelligence,
    at least the concept of it which we generally think of when we **do** think of
    it, does not actually exist.

    the 1960s what their idea of AI was, they would probably agree that a small device
    that fit in our pockets, which could help anticipate our next moves and desires,
    and had the entirety of human knowledge readily available at will, there would
    probably be consensus that said device was true AI. But we all carry smartphones
    today, a very few of us would refer to them as artificial intelligence.'

    that AI is really anything tangible, I guess it's hard to say that it fits in
    anywhere. But there are a number of areas related to data science and machine
    learning where AI has provided **motivation**, which at times is just as valuable
    as the tangible; computer vision certainly comes to mind, as does contemporary
    deep learning research, which have both benefited from the *Artificial Intelligence
    Ethos* at some point, if not indefinitely.

    which never actually produces anything in its namesake industry. While I would
    say that drawing a straight line from AI to data science may not be the best way
    to view the relationship between the 2, many of the intermediary steps between
    the 2 entities have been developed and refined by AI in some form.

    what exactly **is** data science? To me, this is the toughest concept of the lot
    to attempt to define precisely. Data science is a multifaceted discipline, which
    encompasses machine learning and other analytic processes, statistics and related
    branches of mathematics, increasingly borrows from high performance scientific
    computing, all in order to ultimately extract insight from data and use this new-found
    information to tell stories. These stories are often accompanied by pictures (we
    call them visualizations), and are aimed at industry, research, or even just at
    ourselves, with the purpose of gleaning some new idea from The Data.

    areas (see everything you've read above here). Data science is both synonymous
    with data mining, as well as a superset of concepts which **includes** data mining.

    common aspect of insight. Data science is all of this and more, and to you it
    may be something else completely... and we haven't even covered acquiring, cleaning,
    wrangling, and pre-processing data yet! And by the way, what even **is** data?
    And is it always big?

    can be represented by the above diagram, jives well with Piatetsky-Shapiro''s
    Venn diagram at the top of this post. I would also suggest that it is also mostly
    in agreement with with Drew Conway''s [data science Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram),
    though I would add one caveat: I believe his very well-reasoned and useful graphic
    is actually referring to **data scientists**, as opposed to data science. This
    may be splitting hairs, but I don''t think the { field | discipline | concept
    } of data science, itself, encompasses hacking skills; I believe this is a skill
    that scientists possess in order to allow the to **do** data science. Admittedly,
    this may be quibbling over semantics, but it makes sense in my mind.'

    evolving. For example, I recall reading, not very long ago, that data mining was
    a sub-field of business intelligence! Even with differences in opinions, I really
    can't imagine this being a valid idea today (it was difficult to accept a few
    years ago, to be honest).
