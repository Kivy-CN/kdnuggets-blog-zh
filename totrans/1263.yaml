    up of data scientists and machine learners from all over the world with a variety
    of skills and backgrounds. The community has around 3 million active members.
    Although it is not rigorously representative of the entire population of Data
    Science and ML professionals across the globe from the sociological perspective,
    it still constitutes the significant fraction of the practitioners and professionals
    in the field. Therefore, the results of the survey can really draw the projections
    of where the Data Science and AI/ML industry is likely to evolve in the next couple
    of years.
