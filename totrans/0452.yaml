    you will want to ask yourself what is important. For me, I have had a few positions
    in data science, and these are some of the most critical questions that I think
    are important to consider when selecting the next job.

- en: Studying data science usually consists of mastering machine learning algorithms,
    but there is one huge part that is often neglected in academia, which is the operations
    of these algorithms. The reason can be that there are plenty of different ways
    to deploy your models, and a lot of the options can include costly, specific platforms
    that are already integrated into your business. Because of this variability, schools
    or programs might choose not to include operations on their syllabus, which is
    understandable.
  prefs: []

- en: With that being said, you will most likely want to ask if this work will be
    your responsibility as the data scientist, or if you will have a dedicated MLOps
    Engineer (*or Machine Learning Engineer, etc.*). Of course, there are people who
    can do both, and prefer to master both parts of the creation and deployment of
    models process, but it is also okay to be only a data scientist who focuses on
    algorithms. It is even more important to clear this definition with your future
    or current manager.

- en: Similar to the above consideration, you will want to ask if you have someone
    close on your team who is an expert in SQL. Some data science positions require
    little SQL, while others can require it nearly daily. In your interview, you will
    want to narrow down how much SQL you can expect to perform, and if you are the
    only one or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, there is someone else, like a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or
    Data Engineer who is more of an expert, who lives in SQL. However, in some data
    science positions, you will be required to query your data before the modeling
    process, as well as after.

    on it, while in other roles, there are a few people working on the same model.
    People move at their own pace, have more or less productive days over other days,
    and can enjoy or not enjoy working with others on the same project daily.

    and these are just some of those questions or considerations you could ask and
    bring up. Additionally, you could still bring up some of these questions even
    in your current role.
