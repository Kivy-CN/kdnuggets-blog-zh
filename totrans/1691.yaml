    tools for data science are many and varied, and span a variety of ecosystems.
    Python and R tend to be some of the more popular programming environments, but
    there are many other options, including a plethora of programming and scripting
    languages, GUI- and web-based tools.'

    Sure, you use the command line to execute your Python scripts, or run your C program,
    or invoke your R environment... or whatever else you might do with it. But what
    about running the entire show from the terminal?

    help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist. You’ll learn how
    to combine small, yet powerful, command-line tools to quickly obtain, scrub, explore,
    and model your data.

    is to inspect the data and its properties. Here, we want to know, for example,
    what the raw data looks like, how many data points the data set has, and what
    kind of features the data set has.

- en: The second perspective from which we can explore out data is to compute descriptive
    statistics. This perspective is useful for learning more about the individual
    features. One advantage of this perspective is that the output is often brief
    and textual and can therefore be printed on the command line.

    we can gain insight into how multiple features interact. We’ll discuss a way of
    creating visualizations that can be printed on the command line. However, visualizations
    are best suited to be displayed on a graphical user interfaces. An advantage of
    visualizations over descriptive statistics is that they are more flexible and
    that they can convey much more information.

    willing to become), you can delve into more advanced concepts such as creating
    bash scripts with numerous commands working in sequence. This, however, moves
    from "command line" data science into the more familiar realm of scripting, but
    with bash instead of, for example, Python. You could also do something in between,
    such as creating a library of bash snippets as functions and adding them to your
    `.bashrc` config file, in order to call them from the command line repetitively
    on different data. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination and
    skill.
