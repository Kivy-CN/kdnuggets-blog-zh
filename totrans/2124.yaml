- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT and Mistral's Mixtral are increasingly
    playing an important role in the development of AI-powered applications. The ability
    of these models to generate human-like results makes them the perfect assistants
    for content creation, code debugging, and other time-intensive tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, one common challenge faced when working with LLMs is the possibility
    of encountering factually incorrect information, popularly known as hallucinations.
    The reason for these occurrences is not far-fetched. LLMs are trained to provide
    satisfactory answers to prompts; in cases where they can’t provide one, they conjure
    up one. Hallucinations can also be influenced by the type of inputs and biases
    employed in training these models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this article, we will explore three research-backed advanced prompting techniques
    that have emerged as promising approaches to reducing the occurrence of hallucinations
    while improving the efficiency and speed of results produced by LLMs.

    important we talk about the basics of prompt writing. Prompts in the context of
    AI (and in this article, LLMs) refer to a group of characters, words, tokens,
    or a set of instructions that guide the AI model as to the intent of the human
    user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prompt engineering refers to the art of creating prompts with the goal of better
    directing the behavior and resulting output of the LLM in question. By using different
    techniques to convey human intent better, developers can enhance models’ results
    in terms of accuracy, relevance, and coherence.

    have divested a lot of resources into LLM optimization, i.e., actively studying
    the common reasons for hallucinations and finding effective ways to address them.
    The following prompting techniques have been found to provide better and context-aware
    instructions to the studied LLMs, thereby increasing the chances of getting better
    relevant results and also reducing the likelihood of getting inaccurate or nonsensical
    information.

- en: A [2023 study by Microsoft researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760) found
    that using emotional language and persuasive prompts, called “EmotionPrompts,"
    can improve LLM performance by over 10%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This style adds a personal, emotional element to the given prompt, transforming
    the request into one that’s highly important with significant consequences for
    the results. It's almost like talking to a human; using an emotional angle helps
    communicate the importance of the task, stimulating deeper focus and commitment.
    This strategy can be useful for tasks requiring higher problem-solving and creativity
    skills.

    a question before requesting the model to provide an answer. This ensures the
    model gets a robust context, which will help it give a technically correct and
    relevant answer.
