    isolated units that have their own software, libraries and configuration files.
    In a simplified view a container is a separate, independent virtual operating
    system that has means to communicate with the outside world.

    to impossible are rigour and consistency. And if you have ever tried to work with
    machine learning models you probably know how easy it is to loose track of the
    tested parameters. Back in the day parameter tracking was done in lab notebooks,
    I am certain these are still very useful in other fields, but in Computer Science
    we now have tools much more powerful than that.

    be stepped up. This was me in the first year of my PhD. As an excuse, I should
    say that I had a spreadsheet where I would log the details of every experiment
    and all associated files. However, it is still very convoluted and every change
    in parameters logging would inevitably impact the post-processing scripts.

    now use in every project. It lets you track, compare, visualize and optimize machine
    learning experiments with just a few lines of code. It also lets you track your
    datasets. Despite a large number of options I found W&B easy to set up and use
    with a very friendly web interface.

    on which your model has been trained. Although I have used it solely for the purpose

    It allows to manage the whole ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility

    To an extent this is justified by very strict requirements for personal contribution.

    Whenever a team is building a [deep image quality metric](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-image-quality-assessment-30ad71641fac) each
    member could have its own branch of the code, working in parallel. Different parts
    of the solution can then be merged together. Whenever someone introduces a bug,
    it is dead easy to revert to the working version. Overall I rank git as the most
    important of all the tools I have mentioned in this article.
