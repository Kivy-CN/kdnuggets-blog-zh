    in the process of completing one task, another request comes through the door.
    If you work with data, something that you hope would take you a couple of hours
    may turn into a couple of days.

    lost in so much work that we fall out of pattern and organising ourselves goes
    out the window. I always say to people, in regards to organising yourself; if
    it takes less than 10 minutes, do it now.

    get overwhelming. There are so many files, notebooks, and documents. It can get
    messy real fast. Below are some tips to help you organise yourself when working

    of datasets, etc. Many times files get lost because team members don’t remember
    the file name; however, a quick search on your Mac or Windows can eliminate that
    problem and save you time if you give the files descriptive names.

    messy quickly. Creating folders for specific projects, which contain sub-folders
    will help you differentiate the difference and also easily find files, etc. Explaining
    this process to the rest of the team, ensuring everybody uses the same system
    will resolve issues such as missing datasets, notebooks, etc.

    do that because the projects will be divided up, with descriptive file names.
    They will not need to consult other team members about the location of these files
    if everybody adheres to the procedure.

    from one another. You may be going through a project and find yourself struggling
    with a similar issue that you had in the past with another project; however, you
    don’t remember if the issue was the same or the solution.

    this could include research or issues that may affect the project. Continuing
    to add information as the project progresses is important to understand the problems
    and solutions, along with knowing what not to do next time. This is an important
    element to improve the workflow of an organisation.
