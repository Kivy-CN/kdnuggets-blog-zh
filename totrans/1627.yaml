- en: 'One of the most difficult and most critical parts of implementing data science
    in business is **quantifying the return-on-investment or ROI**. In this article,
    we highlight **three reasons you need to learn the Expected Value Framework, a
    framework that connects the machine learning classification model to ROI**. Further,
    we’ll point you to a new video we released on the [Expected Value Framework: Modeling
    Employee Churn With H2O](https://youtu.be/amGLWN4hmY0) that was recently taught
    as part of our flagship course: [Data Science For Business (DS4B 201)](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover/?product_id=635023&coupon_code=DS4B_15).
    The video serves as an overview of the steps involved in calculating ROI from
    reducing employee churn with H2O, tying the key H2O functions to the process.
    Last, we’ll go over some **Expected Value Framework FAQ’s** that are commonly
    asked in relation to applying Expected Value to machine learning classification
    problems in business.'

    tie data science to ROI for a machine learning classifier. We’ll use examples
    from the [DS4B 201 course](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover/?product_id=635023&coupon_code=DS4B_15) that
    are related to employee churn (also called employee turnover or employee attrition).

- en: F1 is the threshold that harmonically balances the precision and recall (in
    other words, it optimally aims to reduce both the false positives and the false
    negatives finding a threshold that achieves a relative balance). The problem is
    that, in business, the costs associated with false positives (Type 1 Errors) and
    false negatives (Type 2 Errors) are *rarely* equal. In fact, in many cases false
    negatives are much more costly ( by a factor of 3 to 1 or more!).

- en: '*Calculating Expected Attrition Cost From H2O + LIME Results*We develop a proposal
    to reduce overtime using the extremely powerful H2O classification model along
    with LIME, which explains the results. Like many algorithms, by default we optimize
    by treating Type 1 and Type 2 errors. This ends up misclassifying people that
    quit (Type 2 error) at roughly the same rate as we misclassify people that stay
    as leave (Type 1 error). The cost of overtime reduction for an employee is estimated
    at 30% of the lost productivity if the employee quits. However, t**he cost of
    reducing the overtime incorrectly for someone that stays is 30% or 3x more costly
    than Type 1 Errors, yet we are treating them the same!** The ***optimal threshold
    for business problems*** is almost always less than the F1 threshold. This leads
    us to our second reason you need to know the Expected Value Framework.'

- en: When we have a calculation to determine the expected value using business costs,
    we can perform the calculation iteratively to find the optimal threshold that **maximizes
    the expected profit or savings of the business problem**. By iteratively calculating
    the savings generated at different thresholds, we can see which threshold optimizes
    the targeting approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the detailed example, we can see in the threshold optimization results that
    the maximum savings ($546K) occurs at a threshold of 0.149, which is **16% more
    savings** than the savings at threshold at max F1 ($470K). It’s worth mentioning
    that the threshold that maximizes F1 was 0.280, and that for a test set containing
    15% of the total population it cost $76K due to being sub-optimal ($546K - $470K). **Extending
    this inefficiency to the full population (train + test data), this is a missed
    opportunity of $500K annually!**

    overtime percentage* and *net revenue per employee* because our estimates for
    the future may be off. In the **Sensitivity Analysis Results** shown below, we
    can see in the profitability heat map that as long as the average overtime percentage
    is less than or equal to 25%, implementing a targeted overtime policy saves the
    organization money.

    case, we can use expected value to test for a range of inputs that are variable
    from year to year and person to person. If you’re interested in learning how to
    apply the expected value framework for your business, we show you how, provide
