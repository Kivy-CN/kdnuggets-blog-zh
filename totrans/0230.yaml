    (AI) is becoming synonymous with modern machine learning. Whereas AI used to encompass
    many types of computational techniques used in the simulation of intelligence
    in machines, it almost exclusively refers to the state of the art (SOTA) advances
    in one branch of modern machine learning in particular: deep learning.'

    Sutskever and Hinton''s [ImageNet victory](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional.pdf)
    in October 2012 kicked off the modern deep learning revolution. Since then, deep
    learning has gone on to conquer SOTA results in almost every AI subfield and domain
    it has been put up against: computer vision; natural language processing; speech
    recognition; medical image analysis; image reconstruction; text generation; and
    much more.'

- en: Artificial Intelligence is the process of building intelligent machines from
    vast volumes of data. Systems learn from past learning and experiences and perform
    human-like tasks. It enhances the speed, precision, and effectiveness of human
    efforts. AI uses complex algorithms and methods to build machines that can make
    decisions on their own. Machine Learning and Deep learning forms the core of Artificial
    Intelligence.

    that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms.
    While machine learning uses simpler concepts, deep learning works with artificial
    neural networks, which are designed to imitate how humans think and learn.
