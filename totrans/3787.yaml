- en: GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that provides a continuous integration and
    continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for all GitHub repositories for free. It
    automates the entire software development workflow, from creating and testing
    to deploying code, all within the GitHub platform. You can use it to improve your
    development and deployment efficiency.

    They are composed of one or more jobs and can be triggered by GitHub events such
    as a push, pull request, issue creation, or by workflows. Workflows are defined
    in a YML file within the .github/workflows directory of your repository. You can
    edit it and rerun the workflow right from the GitHub repository.

    model.

    will include performance metrics and a confusion matrix, and we will also receive
    an email with all this information.

    To get started with MLOps, it is recommended to follow a comprehensive tutorial,
    "[A Beginner's Guide to CI/CD for Machine Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/ci-cd-for-machine-learning)".
    It will provide you with a solid foundation to effectively implement MLOps techniques.
