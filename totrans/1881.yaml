    are looking into using GPU for image processing. In this article I review the
    basics of GPU’s that are needed for a data scientist and list a frame work discussed
    in [literature](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841514001819)
    for suitability of GPU for an algorithm.

- en: 'Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) were originally created for rendering graphics.
    However due to their high performance and low cost they have become the new standard
    of image processing. Their application areas include image restoration, segmentation
    (labeling), de-noising, filtering, interpolation and reconstruction. A web search
    on what is a GPU would result to : “A **graphics processing unit** (**GPU**) is
    a computer chip that performs rapid mathematical calculations, primarily for the
    purpose of rendering images.”'

    GPU computing is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) together with a CPU
    to accelerate scientific, analytics, engineering, consumer, and enterprise applications.
    [They also say](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2009/12/16/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/)
    if CPU is the brain then GPU is Soul of the computer.'

- en: GPU’s used for general-purpose computations have a highly data parallel architecture.
    They are composed of a number of cores. Each of these cores have a number of functional
    units, such as arithmetic and logic units (ALUs) etc. One or more of these functional
    units are used to process each thread of execution. These group of functional
    units that help the thread are called **“thread processors”**. *All thread processors
    in a core of GPU perform the same instructions, as they share the same control
    unit*. This means that GPUs can perform the same instruction on each pixel of
    an image in parallel. GPU architectures are complex and differ from manufacture
    to manufacture. The two main players in GPU market are Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia
    calls thread processors as CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) cores, AMD
    calls them as Stream Processors (SP) .

- en: The main difference between a thread processor and a CPU core is that each CPU
    core can perform different instructions on different data in parallel because
    each CPU core has separate control unit. [Researchers](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4490125)
    have defined core as a processing unit with an independent flow of control. Based
    on this definition, [scientists](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841514001819)
    are referring to a group of thread processors that share the same control unit
    as cores. GPU’s are constructed to fit many thread processors on a chip while
    CPU’s are focused on advanced control units and large caches.

- en: There are 2 main frameworks for GPU programming — [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)
    and CUDA. CUDA programming language can be used with Nvidia only where as OpenCL
    is an open standard for parallel computing on different devices including GPUs,
    CPUs and FPGAs. There are a few image processing libraries that provide GPU implementation — OpenCV,ArrayFire,
    Nvidia Performance Primities (NPP), CUVLIB, Intel Integrated Performance Primitivies,
    OpenCL Integrated Performance Primitives and the Insight Took Kit (ITK). Out of
    these the larger ones are OpenCV (supports CUDA and OpenCL) and ITK (supports
    only OpenCL).

    GPU for your algorithm. Nvidia CUDA is more popular since most apple laptops have
    them but others are getting steam as well. Let me know if you have questions and
    comments.
