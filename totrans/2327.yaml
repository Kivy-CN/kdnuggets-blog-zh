  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Research/Gathering Data
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During this stage, you will gain better knowledge of the problem or task at
    hand from a business perspective. This will then help you gather the correct data
    to input into your model. The quality and quantity of your data will determine
    how effectively your predictive produces trustworthy outputs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Data Preparation
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Preparing data takes up a lot of time, because data is never in the format we
    need it at. This will include de-duping, normalization, error correction and further
    areas of preparation such as feature engineering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Building your Model
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the task at hand, you will choose the correct model to help solve
    your problem. The next stage in this roadmap process goes through the different
    Machine Learning algorithms you will typically come across.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Train and test your model
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This stage is testing your model with the data you collected and prepared. The
    training dataset will be used to improve the model’s ability to make predictions.
    The test dataset is a subset of the training dataset, and provides us with an
    unbiased evaluation of the final model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5\. Model Optimization and Evaluation
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model optimization is the process of training the model iteratively, leading
    to a maximum and minimum function evaluation. Further evaluation includes testing
    the model using data that has not been used during the training phase to see the
    performance of the model against data it has not seen before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6\. Experiment tracking
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to get to a point where your model is performing very well, you would
    have gone through a lot of tuning. All these components that have been tuned,
    from the model to metrics will need to be tracked to keep the project organized
    and provide easy access to the history of the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7\. Model Deployment
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the last stage of the machine learning process. The point in which you
    put your machine learning model into production, so that it can be used to make
    business decisions based on data.
