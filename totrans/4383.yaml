    Google Colab have become synonymous with [Deep Learning](https://blog.exxactcorp.com/category/deep-learning/) as
    they provide people with an easy and affordable way to quickly get started building
    their own neural networks and training models. GPUs aren’t cheap, which makes
    building your own custom workstation challenging for many. Although the cost of
    a deep learning workstation can be a barrier to many, these systems have become
    more affordable recently thanks to the lower cost of [NVIDIA’s new RTX 30 series](https://www.exxactcorp.com/Deep-Learning-NVIDIA-GPU-Workstations).'

    hand, many people still flock to using PyTorch and Google Colab as they get used
    to working with deep learning projects.

- en: PyTorch was developed by Facebook and has become famous among the Deep Learning
    Research Community. It allows for parallel processing and has an easily readable
    syntax that caused an uptick in adoption. PyTorch is generally easier to learn
    and lighter to work with than TensorFlow, and is great for quick projects and
    building rapid prototypes. Many use PyTorch for computer vision and natural language
    processing (NLP) applications.

    resources to run deep learning experiments. It offers GPU and TPU support and
    integration with Google Drive for storage. These reasons make it a great choice
    for building simple neural networks, especially compared to something like [Random
    Forest](https://blog.exxactcorp.com/3-reasons-to-use-random-forest-over-a-neural-network-comparing-machine-learning-versus-deep-learning/).

    interface, GPU support (including Free and Paid options), storage, and code documenting
    ability all in one application. Data Scientists can have an all-inclusive Deep
    Learning experience without having to spend a fortune on GPU support.

    to have a single neutral place to store data science projects. The [Jupyter notebook](https://blog.exxactcorp.com/the-4-best-jupyter-notebook-environments-for-deep-learning/) interface
    combined with GPU instances allow for a nice reproducible environment. You can
    also import notebooks from GitHub or upload your own.

    on Colab. However, there is still legacy code running Python 2\. Thankfully, Colab
    has a [fix for this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fNru_ht5fNmtf7W4TkB2cFbxW3fMxS6f),
    which you can use to still run Python 2\. If you give it a try, you’ll see there’s
    a warning that Python 2 is officially deprecated in Google Colab.*'

    a suite of modules to build deep learning models. A difference will be the PyTorch
    Tensor Class which is similar to the Numpy *ndarray.*

    on either a CPU or GPU. [To run on a GPUm we can just change the environment to
    use a GPU using the built-in CUDA module in PyTorch.](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/cuda.html) This
    makes switching between GPU and CPU easy.

- en: Data presented to a neural network has to be in a numerical format. Using PyTorch,
    we do this by representing data as a Tensor. A Tensor is a data structure which
    can store data in *N *dimensions; a Vector is a 1 dimensional Tensor, a matrix
    is a 2 dimensional Tensor. **In layman’s terms, tensors can store in higher dimensions
    compared to a vector or a matrix.**

    suited towards large scale industrial deep learning. It is geared more towards
    beginner to mid-level practitioners. It does offer a paid service for larger scale
    projects, such as being connected for up to 24 hours instead of 12 hours in the
    free version, and can provide direct access to more powerful resources if needed.
