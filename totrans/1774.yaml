    skills, qualifications, education, experience, and responsibilities. This definition
    is somewhat loose since there really isn’t a standardized definition of the data
    scientist role, and given that the ideal experience and skill set is relatively
    rare to find in one individual.

    versed on all the tools, techniques, and algorithms available to a data scientist

    on). Given this, they may not be able to tell a data scientist what they would
    like as a final deliverable, or suggest the data sources, features (variables),
    and path to get there.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve already discussed the business domain and communication pillars, which
    represent business acumen and top notch communication skills. This is very important
    for the discovery and goal phase. It’s also very helpful in that data scientists
    typically have to present and communicate results to key stakeholders, including
    executives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So strong soft skills, particularly communication (written and verbal) and public
    speaking ability are key. In the phase where results are communicated and delivered,
    the magic is in the data scientist’s ability to deliver the results in an understandable,
    compelling, and insightful way, while using appropriate language and jargon level
    for her audience. In addition, results should always be related back to the business
    goals that spawned the project in the first place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For all of the other phases listed, data scientists must draw upon strong computer
    programming skills, as well as knowledge about statistics, probabilities, and
    mathematics in order to understand the data, choose the correct solution approach,
    implement the solution, and improve on it as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One important thing to discuss are off-the-shelf data science platforms and
    APIs. One may be tempted to think that these can be used relatively easily and
    thus not require significant expertise in certain fields, and therefore not require
    a strong, well-rounded data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and one can probably obtain pretty decent results depending on the problem being

    knowing which business goals are most important and how the data can be used to
    achieve certain goals. In addition, data scientists typically employ much more
    advanced statistical and modeling techniques, data visualizations, and emphasize
    reporting in a more business-driven storytelling way.

    be thought of as a type of *data architect*. They are less concerned with statistics,
    analytics, and modeling as their data scientist/analyst counterparts, and are
    much more concerned with data architecture, computing and data storage infrastructure,
    data flow, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    *ETL*/*ELT*) in a way that’s optimized for analytics, business intelligence, and
    modeling.
  prefs: []
