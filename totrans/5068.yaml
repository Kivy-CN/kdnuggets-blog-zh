    in Python all the way to knowledgeable practitioner in 7 steps, all while using
    freely available materials and resources along the way. The prime objective of
    this outline is to help you wade through the numerous free options that are available;
    there are many, to be sure, but which are the best? Which complement one another?
    What is the best order in which to use selected resources?

    some base understanding of Python is crucial. Fortunately, due to its widespread
    popularity as a general purpose programming language, as well as its adoption
    in both scientific computing and machine learning, coming across beginner's tutorials
    is not very difficult. Your level of experience in both Python and programming
    in general are crucial to choosing a starting point.

    and machine learning packages at some point, I suggest that you [install Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).
    It is an industrial-strength Python implementation for Linux, OSX, and Windows,
    complete with the required packages for machine learning, including numpy, scikit-learn,
    and matplotlib. It also includes iPython Notebook, an interactive environment
    for many of our tutorials. I would suggest Python 2.7, for no other reason than
    it is still the dominant installed version.

    in what people consider a "data scientist](/2015/05/data-science-machine-learning-scientist-definition-jargon.html)."
    This actually is a reflection of the field of machine learning, since much of
    what data scientists do involves using machine learning algorithms to varying
    degrees. Is it **necessary** to intimately understand [kernel methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method)
    in order to efficiently create and gain insight from a support vector machine
    model? Of course not. Like almost anything in life, required depth of theoretical
    understanding is relative to practical application. Gaining an intimate understanding
    of machine learning algorithms is beyond the scope of this article, and generally
    requires substantial amounts of time investment in a more academic setting, or
    via intense self-study at the very least.

    the theoretical aspects of machine learning in order to practice, in the same
    manner that not all programmers require a theoretical computer science education
    in order to be effective coders.

    however, is to browse the course notes compiled by a former student of the online
    course's previous incarnation. Skip over the Octave-specific notes (a Matlab-like
    language unrelated to our Python pursuits). Be warned that these are not "official"
    notes, but do seem to capture the relevant content from Andrew's course material.
    Of course, if you have the time and interest, now would be the time to take [Andrew
    Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

    moving forward to particular exercises below, and referencing applicable sections
    of the above notes and videos when appropriate. For example, when you come across
    an exercise implementing a regression model below, read the appropriate regression
    section of Ng's notes and/or view Mitchell's regression videos at that time.
