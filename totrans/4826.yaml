    working with data. It provides algorithms for many standard machine learning and
    data mining tasks such as clustering, regression, classification, dimensionality
    reduction, and model selection.

    has been modified, providing an ability to use more than one metric. Several training
    methods like nearest neighbors and logistic regressions faced some minor improvements.
    Finally, one of the major updates is the accomplishment of the [Glossary of Common
    Terms and API Elements](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/glossary.html#glossary) which
    acquaints with the terminology and conventions used in Scikit-learn.

- en: Gradient boosting is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms, which
    lies in building an ensemble of successively refined elementary models, namely
    decision trees. Therefore, there are special libraries designed for fast and convenient
    implementation of this method. Namely, we think that XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost
    deserve special attention. They are all competitors that solve a common problem
    and are used in almost the same way. These libraries provide highly optimized,
    scalable and fast implementations of gradient boosting, which makes them extremely
    popular among data scientists and Kaggle competitors, as many contests were won
    with the help of these algorithms.

    of TensorFlow, Theano, and now as a result of the new releases, it is also possible
    to use CNTK and MxNet as the backends. It simplifies many specific tasks and greatly

- en: Deep learning problems are becoming crucial nowadays since more and more use
    cases require considerable effort and time. However, processing such an amount
    of data is much easier with the use of distributed computing systems like Apache
    Spark which again expands the possibilities for deep learning. Therefore, dist-keras,
    elephas, and spark-deep-learning are gaining popularity and developing rapidly,
    and it is very difficult to single out one of the libraries since they are all
    designed to solve a common task. These packages allow you to train neural networks
    based on the Keras library directly with the help of Apache Spark. Spark-deep-learning
    also provides tools to create a pipeline with Python neural networks.
