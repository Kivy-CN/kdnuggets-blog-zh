    test and build a model, and make sure the model is running smoothly. Sounds straightforward
    enough, except not all parts of the cycle are created equal: data preparation
    takes [80%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/?sh=4c15c90e6f63)
    of any given data scientist’s time. No matter what project you’re working on,
    most days you’re cleaning data and converting raw data into features that machine
    learning models can understand. The monotonous hole of data prep blends hours
    together and makes each day of work feel identical to the one before it.'

- en: You can—with a Feature Store. A [Feature Store](https://towardsdatascience.com/do-you-need-a-feature-store-35b90c3d8963)
    is a shareable repository of features made to automate the input, tracking, and
    governance of data into ML models. Feature stores compute and store features,
    enabling them to be registered, discovered, used, and shared across a company.
    A feature store makes sure features are always up to date for predictions and
    maintains the history of each feature’s values in a consistent manner so that
    models can be seamlessly trained and re-trained.

- en: First and foremost, a feature store allows you to reuse features and data pipelines
    for each model you create. No more waiting around for bespoke ETL pipelines from
    data engineers, and no more having to copy, paste, and tweak feature definitions
    from previous models—just search, find, and use the feature you want.

    features is the same as what your deployed models see. Because feature stores
    use the same pipelines to get features and training sets, they are automatically
    consistent. This makes it easy to evaluate and train models, especially at a scale
    where you start to lose track of where the different training sets are stored
    and when they were updated.

    and on Monday when deployed, they would begin on the same day in both cases. This
    consistency makes it way easier to identify model or feature drift in the case
    it does occur. In addition, it’s far easier to retrain your model if something
    does go wrong since there’s a single point of truth to refer to in a single location.

- en: Creating a training set from historical values is complicated on its own, but
    when you’re building a model that needs to be regularly re-trained, retrieving
    different time-series feature sets is a real headache. Having to write complex
    SQL temporal joins is a lot of work and often outside the skill set of most data
    scientists. It’s all too easy to make mistakes that could compromise your model.
  prefs: []

- en: Feature stores log the time a feature was observed, as well as when it was added
    to the feature store, so you can identify the value of features at any point in
    time. By logging these timestamps, feature stores automatically enable point-in-time
    correctness when building training sets. This makes it incredibly easy to train
    a model on accurate data and automatically retrain it without worrying about data
    leakage.

- en: Many people assume that data scientists spend most of their time testing and
    building models, but so much of getting a model up and running is wrangling the
    data that makes the model possible. Feature stores keep track of every data pipeline,
    feature, and all associated metadata so that the pieces you use to build a model
    are all reusable, easily shareable, and completely transparent to review. By making
    sure you only have to do each task once, you free up time and energy to focus
    on other projects. Feature stores are an efficiency no-brainer; if you want to
    learn more about their impact on the scale of an entire business, you can read
