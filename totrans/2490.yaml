    and expanding into several new domains, such as **multimodal** applications and
    smaller devices, making technological development grow at a pace never seen before.
    By 2021, the concern for transparent and **trustworthy** AI has caused the concept
    of responsible and explainable AI to grow in importance helping to understand
    how AI works. Another area that is seeing strong growth is **hyperautomation**,
    using multiple interconnected technologies, such AI and machine learning, IoT,
    RPA and augmented analytics, improving human-machine collaboration and enabling
    better productivity.

    Quantum ML is the intersection between quantum computing and AI, and will enable
    the creation of more powerful machine learning and AI models. With the development
    and support of Machine learning with quantum computers by large technology companies,
    it will be possible to have resources accessible through cloud models. The growing
    evolution and adoption of **Intelligent Process Automation** will provide companies
    with greater agility, adding more value than just saving time, improving operational
    efficiency and helping to simplify processes. **Low-code** and **no-code AI**
    solutions will also increasingly enable companies to start using AI, in order
    to develop AI models faster and at lower cost.

    that may be an impediment to this increasing momentum. Consequently, we can expect
    organizations to opt for more low-code/no-code deployments (such as AutoML) to
    harness and maintain the growing AI/ML momentum, which will further differentiate
    the AI leaders from the AI laggards, which supports the old adage "getting things
    done is better than getting things perfect".

- en: One of the major developments in 2021 was the rise of **MLOps** to monitor models
    once they are in production. In part this was necessitated by the pandemic, in
    which predictive demand and supply models for many companies were no longer accurate.
    Detecting model drift is an important MLOps capability. But the rise of MLOps
    is also an outgrowth of increased dependence within many companies upon machine
    learning models to run their businesses, and keeping track of models and how they
    perform is becoming key to business success.

    tools and process improvements to professionalize ML development. They will also
    make more clear "who does what" in AI development and deployment, creating specialty
    roles for model creation, model deployment, model monitoring, and so forth. These
    tasks can't all be left up to data scientists.

    prevalence of **external data sources**. Shifts in global and local economies

    models that rely on the company's own historical data in favor of driver-based
    models that consider leading indicators of performance. Instead of continuing
    to stare at their own navels, businesses now are compelled to look outside the
    organization to diagnose, predict and prescribe customer behavior, inventory levels,
    supplier availability, talent needs, equipment behavior, competitor response,
    partner capacity, and so forth.

    on research and less time on engineering. This year, it advanced as a popular
    deep learning framework to read and reproduce the research on distributed hardware
    and high-performance computing machinery. PyTorch Lightning has been a force to
    reckon with on GPUs, TPUs, and CPUs. Natural language processing advanced in 2021
    with PyTorch Tabular. PyTorch Tabular works on Pandas dataframes in deep learning,
    as there is no ready-to-use library like Scikit-learn for deep learning. It runs
    on PyTorch and PyTorch lightning.

    automating our jobs. For the non-coders or non-data scientists, this will result
    in more advanced robotic process automation that will enable employees and managers
    doing office work to further automate their own work without knowing how to code.
    As a consequence, employees will be able to get more work done because most of
    the monotonous jobs can now be automated. However, if employees and management
    without coding expertise can use AI and ML to automate their jobs, of course,
    those with these skills can also apply the same tactics.

    and steal more data. At the same time, the people defending their companies will
    also turn to AI so more and more both hackers and IT security staff will use AI,
    resulting in a battle taking place at the speed of light.
