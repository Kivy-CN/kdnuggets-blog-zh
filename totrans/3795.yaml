  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best parts are that all the course materials are freely available online,
    and you can complete the program at your own pace. While it is possible to finish
    in 2 years if you study around 20 hrs/week, you can adjust based on your schedule.
    You also join a worldwide community of independent learners who support each other.

    curriculum based on freely available resources, including videos, code examples,
    and quizzes. Participants do not need to enroll formally; all materials and guidelines
    are accessible through the designated GitHub repository https://github.com/ossu/computer-science.
    This program is structured to provide an extensive learning experience similar
    to a 4-year Computer Science degree; however, it is unofficial and does not grant
    academic accreditation or recognition from educational institutions.
