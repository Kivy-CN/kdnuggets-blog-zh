- en: Data science is still the job of the year, especially with all the hype in generative
    AI. However, it’s common that the demand for data science jobs is way lower than
    that of applicants; significantly, many employers still prefer senior data scientists
    over juniors. That’s why many students learning data science find it hard to find
    a job.

    alternative career paths for those who know data science. For both beginners and
    professionals, there are various jobs where you can implement your data science
    skill set.

    should consider.

- en: The first alternative career you can branch off from data science is machine
    learning engineer. People sometimes mistake these two occupations for being the
    same, but they are different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine Learning engineers focus more on the technical aspects of machine learning
    deployment into production, such as how the structure should be designed or how
    the production should be scaled. On the other hand, data scientists focus on extracting
    insight from the data and providing solutions to solve the business problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both share the same foundation in data analysis and machine learning, but the
    differences separate these career paths. If you feel that a Machine Learning Engineer
    position is for you, you should focus on learning more about software engineering
    practice and MLOps to switch to these careers.

- en: Business intelligence (BI) is an alternative career path for those who still
    love to gain insight from the data but are more interested in analyzing historical
    data to inform the business. It’s an important position for any business as a
    company needs to know its current situation from the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BI focuses more on descriptive analytics, where business leaders and stakeholders
    use data insight to develop actionable initiatives. The insights would be based
    on current and historical data in the form of KPI and business metrics so the
    business could make an informed decision. To facilitate the analysis, BI uses
    tools to create dashboards and reports for the business. This makes BI different
    from data scientists because the latter job focuses on providing future predictions
    using advanced statistical analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many BI positions require skills such as basic statistics, SQL, and Data Visualization
    tools such as Power BI. These are skills that people have to learn when they try
    to become data scientists, so BI would be a suitable alternative career path for
    those who love analyzing data.

- en: The last career path you should consider is the Data Analyst. The data analysts
    usually work with the raw data to provide answers to specific questions that are
    required by the business. It contrasts with the works of BI as although they have
    overlapping skills, BI usually uses tools to create dashboards and reports to
    track the KPI and business metrics continuously. In contrast, data analysts typically
    work on a project basis.
  prefs: []

- en: Data analysts often work in each department to provide detailed ad-hoc analysis
    for the specific project and perform statistical analysis to gain insight from
    the data. Data analysts can use SQL, programming language (Python/R), and data
    visualization tools, which are skills that data science has learned.
