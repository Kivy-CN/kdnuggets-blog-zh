    its ground in the fifties. If we exclude the pure philosophical reasoning path
    that goes from the Ancient Greek to Hobbes, Leibniz, and Pascal, AI as we know
    it has been officially started **in 1956 at Dartmouth College**, where the most
    eminent experts gathered to brainstorm on intelligence simulation.

    but more relevantly after the famous paper published by Turing (1950), where he
    proposes for the first time the idea of a ***thinking machine*** and the more
    popular Turing test to assess whether such machine shows, in fact, any intelligence.

    in the US in 1966, followed by the “**Lighthill report” (1973)**, assessed the
    feasibility of AI given the current developments and concluded negatively about
    the possibility of creating a machine that could learn or be considered intelligent.

    domains, but this was enough to stimulate a new funding trend. The most active
    player during those years was the Japanese government, and its rush to create
    the fifth generation computer indirectly forced US and UK to reinstate the funding
    for research on AI.

    met, a new crisis began. In 1987, personal computers became more powerful than
    ***Lisp Machine***, which was the product of years of research in AI. This ratified
    the start of the ***second AI winter***, with the DARPA taking a clear position
    against AI and further funding.

    DeepBlue defeated Kasparov at chess, it was clear that AI was back to the top.

    been only recently recognized as a paradigm shift. There are of course a series

    AI nowadays, but there is a specific event we think it is responsible for the

    of this new AI optimistic wave, i.e., **Dec. 4th 2012**. That Tuesday, a group
    of researchers presented at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference
    detailed information about their convolutional neural networks that granted them
    the first place in the **ImageNet Classification** competition few weeks before
    (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Their work improved the classification algorithm **from
    72% to 85%** and set the use of neural networks as fundamental for artificial
    intelligence.
