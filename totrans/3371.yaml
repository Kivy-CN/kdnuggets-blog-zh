    the underlying [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) models,
    even if you aren’t the person building them. Whether you are integrating a recommendation
    system into your app or building a chat bot, this guide will help you get started
    in understanding the basics of machine learning.

    models and probabilistic algorithms to answer questions so we can make informative
    decisions based on our data.

- en: Machine learning studies computer algorithms for learning to do stuff. We might,
    for instance, be interested in learning to complete a task, or to make accurate
    predictions, or to behave intelligently. The learning that is being done is always
    based on some sort of observations or data, such as examples…direct experience,
    or instruction. So in general, machine learning is about learning to do better
    in the future based on what was experienced in the past.

    learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). Unsupervised algorithms
    are great for exploring your dataset and are used for pattern detection, object
    recognition in images and other classification problems like recommendations based
    on similar items.

    a popular unsupervised algorithm that makes no assumptions about the data meaning
    it uses random seeds and an iterative process that eventually converges. This
    unsupervised clustering algorithm uses a distance metric with the goal of minimizing
    the Euclidean distance from the data points to a centroid, remeasuring and reassigning
    each data point to a centroid on each iteration.

    belonging to the[cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_(statistics)) with
    the nearest [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean), serving as a [prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype) of
    the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into [Voronoi cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_cell).

    contains the correct label for each input and makes inferences based on that relationship
    to predict new unseen data. Supervised algorithms are often used for classification
    problems such as [sentiment labeling](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SentimentAnalysis), [object
    detection in images](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/opencv/ObjectDetectionWithModels),
    credit card fraud detection, and spam filtering to just name a few use cases.

    For instance a regression model is used for the prediction of continuous data
    such as predicting housing prices based on historical data points and trends.
    A classification model is used for the prediction of categorical data, for example assigning
    discrete class labels in an image classification model that labels the image as
    a person or landscape.

    ones is the Naive Bayes model which is often a good starting point for developers
    since it’s fairly easy to understand the underlying probabilistic model and easy
    to execute.

    strategy that recursively separates the data to generate the tree.'

    layer that gives us a known output such as an image label.'
