    However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning
    your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing
    to build a model, and it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out
    meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. It’s
    important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical
    basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools.

    raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical
    skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it
    is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical
    foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable
    and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how
    good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building
    a machine learning regression model, please see this article: [Machine Learning

    needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses
    that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and
    machine learning. As a data science aspirant, it’s important to keep in mind that
    the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient
    and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical
    theory behind each machine learning algorithm.
