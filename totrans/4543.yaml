    from examples. The course covers the necessary theory, principles and algorithms
    for machine learning. The methods are based on statistics and probability-- which
    have now become essential to designing systems exhibiting artificial intelligence.

    widely adopted scientific fields. A considerable amount of literature has been
    published on Machine Learning. The purpose of this project is to provide the most
    important aspects of Machine Learning by presenting a series of simple and yet
    comprehensive tutorials using Python. In this project, we built our tutorials
    using many different well-known Machine Learning frameworks such as Scikit-learn.

    computer programs that automatically improve with experience. Recently, many successful
    machine learning applications have been developed, ranging from data-mining programs
    that learn to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, to information-filtering
    systems that learn users'' reading preferences, to autonomous vehicles that learn
    to drive. There have also been important advances in the theory and algorithms
    that form the foundation of this field. This course will provide a broad introduction
    to the field of machine learning. Prerequisites: CSE 241 and sufficient mathematical
    maturity (Matrix Algebra, probability theory / statistics, multivariate calculus).
    The instructor will hold a take-home placement exam (on basic mathematical knowledge)
    that is due on January 30th.'

- en: Deep Learning algorithms learn multi-level representations of data, with each
    level explaining the data in a hierarchical manner. Such algorithms have been
    effective at uncovering underlying structure in data, e.g., features to discriminate
    between classes. They have been successful in many artificial intelligence problems
    including image classification, speech recognition and natural language processing.
    The course, which will be taught through lectures and projects, will cover the
    underlying theory, the range of applications to which it has been applied, and
    learning from very large data sets. The course will cover connectionist architectures
    commonly associated with deep learning, e.g., basic neural networks, convolutional
    neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Methods to train and optimize the
    architectures and methods to perform effective inference with them, will be the
    main focus. Students will be encouraged to use open source software libraries
    such as Tensorflow.

    of the world from one or more images. In recent years, Deep Learning has emerged
    as a powerful tool for addressing computer vision tasks. This course will cover
    a range of foundational topics at the intersection of Deep Learning and Computer
    Vision.

- en: As machine learning models are increasingly being employed to aid decision makers
    in high-stakes settings such as healthcare and criminal justice, it is important
    to ensure that the decision makers (end users) correctly understand and consequently
    trust the functionality of these models. This graduate level course aims to familiarize
    students with the recent advances in the emerging field of interpretable and explainable
    ML. In this course, we will review seminal position papers of the field, understand
    the notion of model interpretability and explainability, discuss in detail different
    classes of interpretable models (e.g., prototype based approaches, sparse linear
    models, rule based techniques, generalized additive models), post-hoc explanations
    (black-box explanations including counterfactual explanations and saliency maps),
    and explore the connections between interpretability and causality, debugging,
    and fairness. The course will also emphasize on various applications which can
    immensely benefit from model interpretability including criminal justice and healthcare.
