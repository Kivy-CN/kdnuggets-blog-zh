    language might be their choice when diving into data science. This is further
    complicated if you don't already bring a set of existing programming skills on
    which to rely. Even better would be a thorough understanding of Python as you
    shift to data science (substitute another language if it is to be your preferred
    data science programming tool), but many newcomers to the field find themselves
    either starting from relative scratch when it comes to either programming in general,
    or Python more specifically.
