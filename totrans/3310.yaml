    need into picking up machine learning, but many (most?) of them take the long
    view: get a foundation first, learn the basics next, then learn a bit of complementary
    theory before getting too far ahead of yourself in practical terms, take a step
    back, try your hand at a few examples, undertake a project on your own... This
    is all great advice, and a great approach to learning... well, almost anything.'

    have the patience to go through all of the motions. Let's say you want to hit
    the ground running and scramble under pressure to learn everything right now.
    The best approach? Ideally, no, but I'm in no position to judge. I work best under
    pressure, and can sympathize with the impatient among us who just want to get
    on with things.

    With learning machine learning -- much as with machine learning itself -- there
    is no free lunch. However, getting a practical overview for the purposes of testing
    the waters and deciding whether learning more about the topic is what you are
    after, or if you already posses a solid theoretical understanding of much of these
    (or related) concepts, the way of the guerrilla may be for you.'

    will need to install R and R Studio -- the programming language and a GUI programming
    environment for R, respectively. There are all sorts of videos on getting this
    accomplished, which vary from operating system to operating system. As such, I
    will leave you to your own devices to find a video for your personal configuration.'

    introduction to basic R commands, approached from the perspective of introductory
    statistics.

    there are all sorts of videos on this topic -- including many I have used and/or
    suggested in the past -- I like to keep it fresh, and so we will use the following
    video from Nando de Freitas (of University of British Columbia at the time of
    recording). Note that this is not at all R-specific, and covers machine learning
    conceptually as opposed to practically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a great introduction to machine learning from a great mind of the field.
    Incidentally, de Freitas has many other great machine learning videos available
    on YouTube, which would be worth checking out if you are looking for further materials
    on the subject.

    they veer into what could easily be considered machine learning territory. The
    videos go slow, however, and cover a lot of descriptive statistics in R, which
    is a good place to ramp up with the language. These great videos are created by
    Dave Langer of Microsoft.

    machine learning in a few days. It's not a complete course, however; understanding
    the underlying statistical building blocks of machine learning takes years, and
    becoming proficient in the practical will take hundreds of hours of doing. However,
    no one said you can't get your hands dirty and have some introductory fun on the
    way to perfecting a new craft.
