- en: Data Science is often referred to as a combination of developer, statistician,
    and business analyst. In more casual terminology, it can be more aptly described
    as hacking, domain knowledge, and advanced math. Drew Conway does a good job of
    describing the competencies in his [blog](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram)
    post. Much of the recent attention is focused on the early stages of the process
    of establishing an analytics sandbox to extract data, format, analyze, and finally
    create insight (see figure 1 below).

    historical context of how business intelligence has been conducted over the past
    30 years. For example, a new comer to the space, Trifacta, recently [announced
    a $25M venture round](http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/29/trifacta-raises-25-million-for-its-data-transformation-software/)
    that is applying predictive analytics to the data to help improve the feature
    creation step. Its a very good area to focus considering some 80% of the work
    is spent here working to un-bias data, find the variables that really matter (signal
    / noise ratio), and identify the best model (Linear regression, Decision trees,
    Naive Bayes, etc.) to apply to the data. Unfortunately, most of the insights created
    often never make it past what I am calling the "Data Science Last Mile."

- en: What is the Data Science Last Mile? It’s the final work that is done to take
    found insight and deliver in a highly usable format or integrate into a specific
    application. There are many examples of this last mile and here are what I consider
    to be the top examples.

    our insights in a dashboard format with charts and graphs piled on top of each
    other. Newer visual analytics tools like Tableau and Platfora add to the graphing
    melange by making it even easier to plot seemingly unrelated metrics against each
    other. Don't get me wrong, there will always be a place for dashboards.

    ability to take action on them.

- en: At Intel, we had daily standup meetings at 7am where we reviewed key metrics
    and helped drive the priorities each day for the team. We had separate meetings
    scheduled on a project basis for analysis that was more complex like bringing
    up a new process or production tool. Here the *visualization* format is very well
    defined and there is even an industry standard called SPC or Statistic Process
    Control. For every business, there are standard charts for reporting metrics and
    outside of that there is a well defined methodology for plotting data.

    data is by Edward Tufte. My former boss and mentor recommended the book [The Visual
    Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961392142/)
    and it changed my life. One of my favorite visuals from this book is how the French
    visualized their train time tables.

    practice to review these charts on regular basis and apply the recommendation
    to the business, product, or operations on a quarterly or even annual basis.

    in a model. From my experience, this is predominantly done using Excel. Its quite
    surprising to me that there aren't many other applications that have been built
    to make this process easier? Perhaps its due to this knowledge being locked away
    in highly specialized analysts heads? Whatever the reason, this seems like a primary
    area for disruption that there is a significant need to standardize this process
    and de-silo this exercise. One of my favorite quotes is from a former colleague.
    We were working over a long weekend analyzing our new product strategy business
    models when he stated, "When they told me I'd be working on models, this is NOT
    what I had in mind." Whether you're in Operations, Finance, Sales, Marketing,
    Product, Customer Relations, Human Resources, the ability to accurately model
    your business means you're likely able to predict its success.

    data science around us without us evening knowing it. One of the oldest examples
    I can think of is the weather report. We are given a 7 day forecast in the form
    of sun, clouds, rain drops, and green screens managed by verbose interpretive
    dancers. As opposed to reporting the raw probability data of rain, barometric
    pressure, wind speeds, temperatures and many other factors that go into this prediction.

    Market index, or Google's Page Rank, or a likeliness to buy value, or a number
    of other singular values that are used to great effect. These indexes are not
    reported wholesale, although you can find them if you try. (For example, go to
    [pagerank.chromefans.org/](http://pagerank.chromefans.org/) to see Google Page
    Rank for any website). Instead, they are packaged into a usable format like Search,
    Product Recommendations, and many other productized formats that bridge the gap
    between habit and raw data. For me, this is the area that I am most focused on
    as the last mile of work that needs to be done to push data into the every aspect
    of our decision making process.

    with more data. It is well known that the best algorithm looses out to the more
    data inputs you have. However, conducting sophisticated statistics and analysis
    on large datasets is not a trivial task. A number of startups have sprung up in
    the last couple years to build frameworks around this, but require a significant
    amount of code skills. Only a few have provided a much more approachable way of
    applying data science to big data.

- en: One such company that has built a visual and highly robust way of conducting
    analytics at scale is [Alpine Data Labs](http://start.alpinenow.com/). It has
    a bevy of native statistical models that you can mix and match to product highly
    sophisticated algorithms that rival the best in class in a matter of minutes,
    not months. Pretty wild to think that only a few years ago we were still hand
    tooling algorithms on a quarterly basis. Check it out for yourself by going to
    http://start.alpinenow.com to see how far we’ve come.

    application of data science before we find our self disillusioned. I for one,
    am already thinking about how to build new products that start with data as its
    core value than an add on to be determined later. There is much more to write
    about on this subject and would love to hear your thoughts.
