- en: Asking the right questions is one of the most important steps for a data science
    project. You need to determine what insights you are trying to obtain from your
    data. In some cases, you need to ask the right questions even before the data
    collection process.

    then you may proceed to the next step. If data is not available, you may need
    to figure out how to collect the data, for example using surveys, or purchase
    already existing data. If you have to collect your own data, some points to keep
    in mind include: the quantity of data you need, time needed to collect the data,
    and the cost of data collection. You need to also make sure the data is representative
    of the population. Irrespective of where your data is coming from, make sure data
    collected is of good quality, because bad data produces low quality and unreliable
    predictive models.'

    or data may be entered on questionnaires in the wrong format. Raw data will have
    to be cleaned and preprocessed to render it suitable for further analysis.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to decide the model that is suitable for the project. Are you just
    interested in descriptive data science such as data visualization or in using
    your data for predictive analysis? For predictive analysis, you may use linear
    regression (for continuous target variable) or classification (for discrete target
    variable). If the data does not have a target variable, you may use clustering
    algorithms for pattern recognition modeling.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For machine learning models such as linear regression, classification, or clustering,
    you have to build, test, and evaluate your model. This will involve partitioning
    your data into training and testing sets. Then you need to determine the types
    of evaluation metrics suitable such as mean square error, R2 score, mean absolute
    error, overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, cross validation
    score, etc.

- en: Are you working on the project on your own or with collaborators? Large scale
    projects may require a team. If working with a team, make sure you assign roles
    to team members based on their experience and expertise. Make sure there is effective
    communication between members in the team, as this will help improve productivity.

    from your analysis. It is important to summarize your results in a way that is
    not too technical.
