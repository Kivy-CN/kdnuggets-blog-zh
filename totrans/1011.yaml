  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though we always assume that variables or features in a dataset are normally
    distributed, it is important to plot the probability distribution to visualize
    how a feature is distributed. For example, using the [heights](https://github.com/bot13956/Bayes_theorem) dataset
    contained in R’s dslabs package, we can compute the probability distribution of
    all heights in the dataset, as shown in Figure 2 below.

    with a mean value of about 68 inches. Now if we plot the probability distribution
    for Male and Female heights separately, we observe two distinct curves, as shown
    in Figure 3.

    the mean Male height (~ 69 inch), which indicates that statistically speaking,
    Males are on average taller than Females. For more information and code used for
    generating Figures 2 and 3, please see this article: [Bayes’ Theorem Explained](https://pub.towardsai.net/bayes-theorem-explained-66ebf8285fcc).
