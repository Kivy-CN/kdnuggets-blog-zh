- en: As an ML engineer or data scientist, sometimes you inevitably find yourself
    in a situation where you have hundreds of records for one class label and thousands
    of records for another class label.

- en: Upon training your model you obtain an accuracy above 90%. You then realize
    that the model is predicting everything as if it’s in the class with the majority
    of records. Excellent examples of this are fraud detection problems and churn
    prediction problems, where the majority of the records are in the negative class.
    What do you do in such a scenario? That will be the focus of this post.

- en: The most straightforward and obvious thing to do is to collect more data, especially
    data points on the minority class. This will obviously improve the performance
    of the model. However, this is not always possible. Apart from the cost one would
    have to incur, sometimes it's not feasible to collect more data. For example,
    in the case of churn prediction and fraud detection, you can’t just wait for more
    incidences to occur so that you can collect more data.

- en: Accuracy is not a good way to measure the performance of a model where the class
    labels are imbalanced. In this case, it's prudent to consider other metrics such
    as precision, recall, Area Under the Curve (AUC) — just to mention a few.

    that were predicted as true positives and false positives. For example, out of
    the number of people our model predicted would churn, how many actually churned?'

    The curve is obtained by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive
    rate. The false positive rate is obtained by dividing the false positives by the
    sum of the false positives and the true negatives.

    the true positives.

- en: Another way to deal with imbalanced data is to have your model focus on the
    minority class. This can be done by computing the class weights. The model will
    focus on the class with a higher weight. Eventually, the model will be able to
    learn equally from both classes. The weights can be computed with the help of
    scikit-learn.

    different algorithms. Generally, tree-based algorithms perform better on imbalanced
    data. Furthermore, some algorithms such as [LightGBM](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree-53f62276de50) have
    hyperparameters that can be tuned to indicate that the data is not balanced.

    increase the number of records in the minority class — usually known as oversampling.
    This is usually done on the training set after doing the train test split. In
    Python, this can be done using the [Imblearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn) package.
    One of the strategies that can be implemented from the package is known as the [Synthetic
    Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html).
    The technique is based on k-nearest neighbors.

    You can also specify the ratio just like in SMOTE, as well as the number of neighbors
    via `n_neighbors`***.***

    weak learners to create a strong classifier. Metrics such as precision-recall
    curve and area under curve (PR, AUC) are also worth trying when the positive class
    is the most important.
