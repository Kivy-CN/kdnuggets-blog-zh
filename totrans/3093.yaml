- en: A couple of months ago I left Pivotal to join [idealo.de](https://www.idealo.de/) (the
    leading price comparison website in Europe and one of the largest portals in the
    German e-commerce market) to help them integrating machine learning (ML) into
    their products. Besides the usual tasks like building out the data science team,
    setting up the infrastructure and many more administrative stuff, I had to define
    the ML powered product roadmap. And associated with this was also the definition
    of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for machine learning products. The question
    I often face though, here at idealo and actually also back at my time at Pivotal,
    is what actually a good MVP means? In this article, I will shed some lights on
    the different dimensions of a good MVP for machine learning products drawing in
    the experiences that I’ve gained so far.

    Ries](https://medium.com/@ericries). Lean startup is basically the state-of-the
    art methodology for product development nowadays. Its central idea is that by
    building products or services iteratively by constantly integrating customer feedback
    you can reduce the risk that the product/service will fail (build-measure-learn).

    a “version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount
    of validated learning about customers with the least effort”. One well known example
    is to validate whether mobility will be successful or not (see image below).

    we just take two wheels and a board. Then we ship this to the market and get feedback
    to continuously improve our product by adding more complexity to it. In this case
    we ended up with a car that integrates the consumer’s feedback. A well known example
    is Airbnb. In 2007, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia wanted to start their own business
    but also couldn’t afford the rent in San Francisco. At the same time, there was
    a design conference coming to town. They decided to rent out their place to conference
    attendees who didn’t find a hotel nearby. What they did was to take pictures of
    their apartment, put it online on a simple website (see image below) and soon
    they had three paying guest for the duration of the conference. This little test
    gave them valuable insights that people would be willing to pay to stay in someone
    else’s home rather than a hotel and that not just recent college grads would sign
    up. Afterwards they started Airbnb and the rest is history (if you want to read
    more successful MVP stories check out this [link](https://speckyboy.com/successful-minimum-viable-products/)).

- en: In contrast to this, the other approach is by constructing the car one by one
    from the wheels up to the chassis without ever shipping it once. However, this
    approach is very costly. At the end of the day, we might ship a product that a
    customer doesn’t want. For example, let’s take Juicero as an example. They raised
    $120m from investors to create a well designed juice-squeezing machine which they
    released after some time of development for a very high price (initially it was
    originally priced at $699 and then subsequently reduced to $399). Along with the
    machine, you could also buy juice packs filled with raw fruits and vegetables
    priced at $5–7\. Maybe some of you might know but the company already shutdown
    because it didn’t realize that you didn’t really need a high-priced juice-squeezing
    machine to squeeze out the juice packs. They didn’t really understand their customers.
    A simple user research would have made them aware that you don’t need an expensive
    machine to squeeze out the juice packs but two healthy hands would haven been
    enough.

    assume we have a classification problem where we want to classify some data into
    pre-defined categories such as [hotdog vs. not hotdog](https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3)!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: A possible approach to solve this classification problem would be to take a
    neural network with one hidden layer. We would next train and evaluate the model.
    Then depending on the results, we might want to keep improving our model. We then
    would add another hidden layer and then do the same modelling exercise again.
    Then depending on the results again we might add more and more hidden layers.
    This approach is fairly straight-forward and actually the best solution to solve
    the hotdog vs. no hotdog problem because no feature engineering is needed (we
    essentially can take the original image as input data). However, for most of the
    classification problems out there, unless they are not specialized problems like
    the ones that we face in computer vision or natural language understanding, this
    is not the best way to solve this kind of problem. The major drawback of deep
    learning is generally its interpretability. It’s generally hard to interpret the
    results of a neural network depending on what kind of network you use. Moreover,
    you fairly spend a huge amount of time in tuning the parameters of a neural network
    where the gain in model performance is negligible.

    to start with a linear model like logistic regression. Although in many real-world
    applications the assumption of linearity is unrealistic, logistic regression does
    fairly well and serves as a good benchmark aka baseline model. Its main advantages
    are also interpretability and you get the conditional probabilities for free which
    is very convenient in many cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then to improve the model and also to relax the linearity assumption, you could
    use tree-based models. In this case, there are two broad categories, bagging and
    boosting. Under the hood, both use decisions trees but with a different way of
    training it. Finally, when all options are exhausted and you would like to keep
    improving your model, we could then utilize deep learning techniques.

- en: During my time at Pivotal Labs, I worked on a lot of projects to help Fortune
    500 companies to help them getting started on their data journey. One of the common
    thing they share is that a lot of those projects started with a huge investment
    into their infrastructure. They spend a lot of money on buying big data platforms,
    the so called “data lakes”. Then after buying them, they started to load the data
    into their data lakes without even thinking of potential use cases. Then they
    heard about something called Apache Spark and added this to the layer as well.
    Now since AI has been the next big thing, they’ve also started to purchase GPUs
    and put deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow on top of this. Sounds great
    right to have all (cool) tools at one place? The biggest problem, however, was
    that after putting all the data into their data lake, the data was just not right
    for the use case. They either didn’t collect the right data or it didn’t just
    exist that can support the potential use case.

    of solving the problem first. With this approach they can realize early on what
    data is needed in order to solve the problem and can also counteract against any
    data error. Other than that, there are a lot of machine learning problems, which
    I’ve seen so far, that can still realistically be solved on a local machine. They
    don’t really need to do this huge investment into their infrastructure. And in
    case, if data is really big, they could use cloud providers like AWS or Google
    Cloud where they can spin up a Spark cluster very easily. And if they have a deep
    learning problem, there would be many options as well. Either they can use the
    already mentioned cloud providers or services like [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) which
    offers them a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for training and deployment of deep
    learning models on the cloud.

    there are many examples for data products such as chatbots, spam detectors and
    many others — the list is long (check out [Neal Lathia](https://medium.com/@neal_lathia)’s
    excellent article for more ML product examples). But in this case, I will focus
    on recommendation services as I work in the e-commerce domain now.

    algorithms and then continue with matrix factorization techniques. Finally, we
    could also try more complex models involving deep learning methods (e.g. deep
    structured semantic model). However, this approach is not really recommended.
    Recommendations can take many forms. Recommendations, for example, given by your
    friends are also recommendations or the top 100 most liked products are also recommendations.
    Not every sophisticated algorithm that we use will also lead to success but it
    has to be tested. In fact, don’t be afraid to start your recommendation service
    without machine learning.

    evaluation metrics (e.g. bounce rate or click rate) and then start with a simple
    approach like top products. Then after testing that users are really inclined
    to click on those recommendations (sometimes they have to get used to this first
    especially if it’s a new product feature) and eventually also might buy those
    recommended items, we could try it out with more sophisticated approaches like
    collaborative filtering techniques. For example, we could create a recommendation
    based on users who bought this item are also interested in those items or users
    who viewed this item are also interested in those items. The variety of options
    are endless for “users who … this item are also interested in those items”.
