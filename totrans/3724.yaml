- en: Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is
    a combination of artificial intelligence and data science that is used in tools
    that can serve a range of functions, including content writing. It allows computers
    to gain a strong comprehension of human language, converting it into data to be
    used by various software and devices (such as smartphones).

- en: This technology allows users to issue voice and text-based commands and queries
    to complete different actions. Chatbots are a [good example of this](https://www.visiativ.com/en/actualites/news/artificial-intelligence-indispensable/),
    creating coherent responses to a customer’s query thanks to intelligent AI that
    reacts to keywords. The queries are processed by an algorithm that delivers the
    most appropriate response to solve the customer’s problem.

    comprehend the meaning of user-submitted text, so it can compile data that can
    be used to generate coherent and engaging content. This is done by processing
    both written and verbal language, including regional dialects, abbreviations,
    colloquialisms, and even spelling mistakes.

    that content creators love is its ability to compile a list of topics that could
    be written about based on a short sentence or simple prompt. As a content creator,
    it is sometimes difficult to think of enough interesting subjects when developing
    your content plan. That’s especially true if you are branching out into new areas
    you have minimal knowledge about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using GPT-3, you could enter a prompt such as “I am a food blogger who wants
    to promote Italian cuisine, here are some of the topics I will write about,” followed
    by the dash symbol on the next line to signal that it is a list. Based on this
    prompt, GPT-3 will return several suggested topics, delving into recent data it
    has gathered.

    interesting and unique. This is something that GPT-3 can help with.
  prefs: []

    tool to combine the topics. First, you must enter a phrase or sentence that tells
    GPT-3 what your goal is (merging topics), then you need to follow this with the
    individual topics and a small summary (example below).

    results; combining two completely unrelated topics can result in some very strange

    to transform them into structured content. GPT-3 can sort through your freeform
    writing and piece it together in a structured way, turning something crude and
    unorganized into a usable template. The clever algorithms will analyze the freeform
    writing and highlight anything of conceptual significance to create an article
    structure, meaning you don’t have to draft it manually.
