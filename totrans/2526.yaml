- en: Some people, especially during the current data science hype, see machine learning
    as just another algorithm. It is part of digitization and helps us automate things,
    and that’s all. Unfortunately, this interpretation completely misses the main
    point. *Machine learning is not just another way to program computers; it represents
    a fundamental shift in the way we understand the world. It is Math 2.0.*

    Their usefulness stems from the fact that they allow us to make predictions about
    the future. Until this point in history, our most sophisticated models of the
    world were written in the language of mathematics (Math 1.0). This is changing
    now. The coming generation of scientific models will be machine learning models
    (probably neural networks): Math 2.0.'

- en: The reason is that machine learning models allow us to describe phenomena of
    a higher level of complexity. The functional relationships we can describe in
    a mathematical theory are very limited, compared to e.g. the function which maps
    ten thousand pixel values to the concept of a dog or a cat, which is what modern
    deep learning does very well.

    of elementary particles scanning through a few petabytes of data recorded at DESY,
    the German center for high energy physics (which at the time was one of the biggest
    datasets in the world, Google had been founded only five years earlier).

    variables a bit tedious since after changing the cut on one variable, we had to
    revisit all the others. So we thought: Can we automate this? And indeed, a simple
    algorithm that we came up with allowed us to optimize our selection automatically.
    We later found out that computer scientists had a term for what we were doing:
    They called it machine learning.'

    adjust our scientific workflow. Instead of using all our physics knowledge to
    increase the signal to background ratio, it was much better to do only the minimal
    cleanup cuts and let the algorithm do the work. Later, with the advent of deep
    learning, researchers at CERN realized that even the reconstruction of physical
    quantities is counterproductive. Just given the raw measurements, deep learning
    is able to outperform any physicist making selections by hand (see figure below). *So
    Math 2.0 lets us see particles that models based on Math 1.0 cannot see.*

- en: People have been wondering why it is that most physical models are very simple,
    for the most part only involving polynomials of degree three or less. Maybe the
    reason is that we only see what we can speak about.

    of amino acids always folds in the same way. There is a lot of regularity there!
    In fact, it is a protein’s structure that defines its function. However, *we cannot
    produce a mathematical function to describe this relationship. But we can build
    a machine learning model which does.* Building such a model is such an important
    milestone that there is speculation about whether AlphaFold, how this particular
    model is called, may be worth a Nobel Prize.'

- en: Because Math 2.0 lets us describe much more complex relationships than Math
    1.0, the next decade will likely see a transformation of biology. Digital biology
    will be written in the language of Math 2.0\. And there will be numerous opportunities
    in other scientific fields with more complex relationships, like social sciences.

- en: Of course, there is more to a scientific theory than just mathematics. The main
    difficulty is finding the right concepts and quantities to describe a given range
    of phenomena. And that will not change. But mathematics does more for us than
    building models and deriving predictions. It also allows us to calculate and derive
    new simplified insights (through algebra) and answer questions about the dynamics
    of a system (through calculus).

- en: We are still at the beginning of the Math 2.0 revolution, but I predict that,
    similarly to the development of mathematics, we will see the emergence of a new
    field that will study *systems of machine learning models* and how they can be
    constructed, automatically optimize themselves, and be used to derive new insights
    enabling us to see the world in a new light.
