    and maintained Python packages for all kinds of tasks and for every field of study.
    You can even access popular packages from Java, C++, and other languages, as there
    are Python wrappers for all of them available.

    more specialized field. However, it is still tricky for non-technical people or
    beginners. You have to learn syntax, functions, and libraries. Then, you have
    to learn to use all these skills to build projects, which will require you to
    take courses and learn from various resources.

- en: I have been guiding students on where to start learning data science, and I
    always recommend starting with Python and SQL. Most of them are not sure about
    paying a huge amount, so I recommend they take a top free course and learn the
    basics, and if they want to get better at it, they can pay for the course.

- en: The free course in this section covers the basics of Python language syntax
    and libraries. You will also learn to use Python for data analysis and build simple
    machine-learning models. All of the courses in this section are popular and have
    been highly rated by people who have taken them.

    this section, I have mentioned the top and free Python developer environments
    you can access through your browser, which are ready to be used in a few seconds.
    These platforms are popular and user-friendly, so instead of setting up your environment
    to test the code or even learn to code, I suggest students use an online Python
    interpreter.
