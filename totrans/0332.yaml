- en: Careers in data are not for everyone — you need patience to work with evolving
    business, security, and infrastructure requirements and a good amount of mental
    endurance to work with endless data issues and changes. But they can also be the
    most interesting jobs in the world. Every month has a new puzzle to put together
    in a new way, and new technologies and innovations keep the field continually
    new. Data careers are also going to be even more vital as AI demands larger and
    more diverse training datasets.

    a reference roadmap that will serve as the framework for this article, and then
    we can talk about the decision points and phases that you will find along the
    way. Whether you are a data scientist, data engineer, software developer, business
    analyst, or infrastructure/security specialist, these paths could apply to you.

    factors.

    skills that you can use immediately? Or would you rather dive deep into computer
    science algorithms or statistics theory?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on those factors, you may decide that spending 3 months and a few hundred
    dollars on a few certifications in a practical, technical area like [Microsoft
    Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id) is
    right for you. On the other end of the spectrum, you may decide that 8 years to
    get a Bachelor’s degree and PhD in Statistics fits your aspirations. There are
    dozens of combinations of paths, but the main question is whether you want to
    make the effort to build a broad, solid foundation or if you feel like you have
    limited time and money and need a job ASAP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the launch phase, it is important to research the future roles that appeal
    to you and then study the job descriptions for those positions. Based on the job
    descriptions, you can reverse engineer the steps that you will need to take to
    get there. What are the the skills, programming languages, and experience needed
    for those roles? With those items in mind, you can create goals to upskill in
    those specific areas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of your path, one of the biggest challenges is to get in the first
    door at a company in your target field. Having taken some random online courses
    won’t help in this situation. You need to find a way to add to your resume some
    clear credentials, an official degree, or documented accomplishments in a recognized
    project-experience forum like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). As you select
    between your options, take a close look at completion rates at the various programs
    and make sure that you feel like you can fully commit to finishing before you
    make any payments or go into debt
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, be creative in how you expand your network. Join a school technology
    club; attend meet-ups with a local tech group; look for an upcoming industry conference
    with networking events. And if you have attended a school with a career center,
    become best friends with everyone in the office and ask them for help to find
    the open positions that other people might overlook. You might find a niche position,
    inside track, or unadvertised opening, that won’t have 500 other online applicants.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As time passes, you will need to be prepared to shift and reskill as your company
    changes directions, your job function is reassigned, or you move to a new job
    at a new company. In the roadmap, these minor shifts are referred to as needing
    to “take the next step.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If those steps require you to work with new technologies or learn a new skill
    that is adjacent to your current skillset, then online courses are an excellent
    way to help navigate the shifts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Online courses, such as those offered by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) or [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/machine-learning),
    are practical, targeted, and cost effective, and they can be assembled into a
    various certifications. The big challenge with these courses, though, is that
    their completion rate is abysmal ([often under 10%](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-completion-rate-online-courses-so-low-matthew-mason/)).
    If your company offers training funds, or if you can negotiate for funds, make
    sure to use those funds wisely and complete your courses.

    issues. New masters programs are designed to be shorter, more targeted, and more
    flexible for the time constraints of people with a full-time job. Online degrees
    are not as effective at building a network of relationships, but you might decide
    that the flexibility is worth the tradeoff.

    this is where a lot of us end up. We let our manager decide which skills or projects
    we are assigned to develop. We let company layoffs determine the timing of our
    next career shift. Or we look at options to upgrade our career, but decide they
    are too intimidating or expensive.
