- en: In 2023, there was a decline in software development as a whole, from learning
    about the sector to a decrease in jobs. Although this is what the data shows,
    software development is still very important and its need with the movement of
    AI remains unchanged.

- en: Generative AI is a significant factor, and 92% of developers use AI for low-level
    coding. It raises the question about the potential of AI being used in high-level
    designs, pushing an emphasis on how humans collaborate with generation AI systems
    moving forward. This shows us the importance of software development shift in
    mastering architecture that is more suited for complex environments that are data
    intensive.

    tasks, such as coding tasks we are naturally seeing a decline in content usage
    of most programming languages. This has led to a decrease in more people wanting
    to go down the traditional learning pathway and career development. There has
    been a decrease in Stack overflow questions and also GitHub pull requests, suggesting
    that developers have shifted from seeking advice from other developers and are
    solely reliant on generative AI.

    in November 2022 and has been the focus ever since. With this being said, more
    industries and organizations have a broader interest in natural language processing
    (NLP) and generative AI models such as Transformers. There has also been a shift
    in tools being used with Pytorch becoming more popular than TensorFlow.

    for their operational and strategic processes. Data science and business analytics
    tools continue to increase, reflecting the importance of them in business operations.
    Data engineering has also seen a minor decline, however, it remains important
    when managing large-scale data storage. There is an increasing demand for AI-driven
    real-time models, and effective data platforms that provide flexible data management
    solutions.

    engineering platforms emerging. Operating systems such as Linux have seen a decrease
    in their content usage due to an increase in automation. This is the same for
    Kubernetes, as new emerging tools are making it easier to manage the complexity
    without needing in-depth knowledge. Some terminology is also being used less,
    but that does not mean it is going away, it just means that emerging technologies
    are improving the operational experience by embedding existing practices.
