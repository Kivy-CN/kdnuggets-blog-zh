- en: Data cleaning is a very important and critical step in your data science project.
    The success of the machine model depends on how you preprocess the data. If you
    underestimate and skip the preprocessing of your dataset, the model won’t perform
    well and you’ll lose a lot of time searching to understand why it doesn’t work
    as well as you would expect.

    in particular a summary with the basics of data cleaning. In this post and [cheat
    sheet](https://www.kdnuggets.com/publications/sheets/Data_Cleaning_with_Python_Cheat_Sheet_Anello.pdf),
    I am going to show five different aspects that characterize the preprocessing
    steps in your data science project.

    we go from detecting and handling missing data, dealing with duplicates and finding
    solutions to duplicates, outlier detection, label encoding and one-hot-encoding
    of categorical features, to transformations, such as MinMax normalization and
    standard normalization. Moreover, this guide exploits the methods provided by
    three of the most popular Python libraries, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Seaborn for
    displaying plots.'

    from the dataset and, consequently, the machine learning model will be able to
    perform better by learning from a clean and preprocessed input.
