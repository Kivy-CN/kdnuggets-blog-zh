    ago the iphone was launched. Back then, our phones took grainy photos and video
    was just wishful thinking. It was still weird to buy shoes over the internet and
    we still had to carry stacks of maps when we visited a new city. And Netflix was
    only a DVD company.

    to Facebook every second and more than 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube
    every minute. We worry more about having connectivity than ensuring we have a
    map. And our mapping apps give us real-time traffic and options to navigate through
    traffic. Don’t want to drive? No problem, use a ride-sharing app that leverages
    trillions of data points. The fundamental shift behind this radical change is
    a combination of massive increases in computational power, storage, and data.
    And of course data scientists, designers, and other technologists that make these
    ideas real.

    the human genome to enabling tailored medical treatments (precision medicine).
    Autonomous vehicles have started to appear on our roads and we’ll see efforts
    to build cargo ships and airplanes. And artificial intelligence has shown new
    ways to think about games as they’ve beat the best humans.

    negligence, naivety, and sophisticated attacks. From the U.S. elections, Brexit,
    accidents from self-driving cars, to racist algorithms; we must expect to see
    the harm from data to increase. And we only beginning to come to grips with the
    social impacts due to job displacement from automation.

    And hearings from the U.S. Congress (with no action). There have been books that
    have highlighted the risks ahead, such as [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/) and [Automating
    Inequality](https://virginia-eubanks.com/books/). And there have been new think
    tanks such as the [Partnership on AI](https://www.partnershiponai.org/), the [AI
    Now Institute](https://ainowinstitute.org/), and the [Center of Humane Technology](http://humanetech.com/) that
    have launched to begin to understand the broader implications to society.

    to ask is: what about the data scientist and the rest of the team that are responsible
    for building these technologies? What is their role in implementing “good” data
    science? ([Also discussed in this post.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-ethics-data-science-dj-patil/))'

    we realized that little was being done to empower the people who want to do what’s
    right. These technologists, designers, and product managers might have the right
    natural instincts, but are often sidelined due to business pressures or suboptimal
    practices. And in other cases don’t even know what questions to ask.'

    book and we finally convinced to be a co-author) we took a look at the best practices
    that we’ve seen across the data scientists and have released a new e-book: [Ethics
    and Data Science](http://a.co/d/4czWEvW).

    an open source project and this is the 0.1 release. We’ve also make sure that
    it will always be **free** and under a [Creative Commons Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) (so
    you can take it and put it with your own efforts). We also want others to consider
    contributing and we’ll be posting those updates on [O’Reilly Radar’s Ethics Series](https://www.oreilly.com/tags/data-ethics).
    We’ve also intentionally kept it as short as we possibly could with the hope that
    you’ll be able to share it with other teams. ([You can get all of our other ebooks
    for free here](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_1?ie=UTF8&text=DJ+Patil&search-alias=digital-text&field-author=DJ+Patil&sort=relevancerank).)

    after the [Checklist Manifesto from Atul Gawande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto))
    for building data products is (if you’re working on something similar, we definitely
    want to hear from you on what works and what doesn’t). Ideas about how to implement
    more ethical behaviors in product development process including a dissent channel
    if you disagree with the team. How we can start interviewing talent for cultural
    fit as well as ethical fit. Also what we call the 5 C’s — five framing guidelines
    help us think about building data products (consent, clarity, consistency, control
    & transparency, and consequences & harm). Finally, we’ve included a set of case
    studies from Ed Felten’s team at Princeton for you and your team to work through.
