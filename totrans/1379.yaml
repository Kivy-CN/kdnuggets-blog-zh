    during this global pandemic. But imagine now that it's your job to create a model
    for the spread of COVID-19 that accounts for humans' unpredictable, near-random
    choices. Your model also could include government mandates for social distancing,
    hospital care availability, pre-existing conditions among a population, and more.

    to create the most accurate, useful models possible to predict and explain the
    spread of COVID-19\. I'm not an epidemiologist, but if you too have been impressed
    and intrigued by the data visualizations and modeling publicized so far, this
    post is for you.

    go about what some call [outbreak analytics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31104603).
    Here's an introductory look at just a few components of this unique analytics
    process. We'll find some lessons for other analytics applications, too.

- en: The [*reproduction number*, or R[0]](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2020posts/how-scientists-quantify-outbreaks.html)
    (pronounced "R naught"), refers to the number of people someone who is ill is
    likely to infect. The R[0] changes in every time and place that a disease occurs
    due to factors like demographics, climate, social structures, and social distancing
    measures. Researchers calculate the R[0] by determining the time between a first
    infection and a second infection (the *generation time*, which can then be charted
    as a *generation time distribution* when this time is known for many pairs of
    sick people). Estimating the R[0] is critical to predicting a disease's spread.
    For SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, the R[0] is currently [thought to vary](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2020posts/how-scientists-quantify-outbreaks.html)
    between 1.5 to 3.5 in different places.

    (available [here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R0/)) can calculate the
    current R[0] using outbreak data. Offering five different methods for calculation,
    it also has an option for sensitivity analysis that shows which selection of time
    window or generation time provided the best fit to the data.'

    developed by [a different group of researchers](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/9/1505/89262)
    that has [an Excel option](http://tools.epidemiology.net/EpiEstim.xls). EpiEstim
    is based on a [branching process model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_process)
    and estimates the R[0] based on simple time series data. This model tries to capture
    the number of people each infected person will infect, but with an element of
    randomness (or stochasticity) -- like a random encounter in the grocery store
    with an infected person. The chart below (part of [a larger graphic](https://academic.oup.com/view-large/figure/86224225/kwt13301.tiff))
    shows the estimates of R[0] generated with this model for five past outbreaks.

    places and at different times can help researchers track the spread and mutation
    of the virus. This analysis can also help the quick identification of possible
    treatments. [Researchers recently demonstrated](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.932350v3.full.pdf)
    a new machine learning approach to identifying the type of an unknown virus and
    its various strains based on its genome (i.e., figuring out its taxonomic classification,
    like the [broad category of "coronavirus"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach converted the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence into a numerical representation
    (see [the full research paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.932350v3.full.pdf)
    for details). The sequences of nearly 15,000 other viruses were also used in the
    training data. The researchers trained six different machine learning models ([Linear
    Discriminant](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_lda.html), [Linear
    SVM, Quadratic SVM](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Data-Science-Blog/And-For-My-Next-Trick-An-Introduction-to-Support-Vector-Machines/ba-p/360762),
    Fine [KNN](https://help.alteryx.com/current/K_Nearest_Neighbors.htm), Subspace
    Discriminant, and Subspace KNN). The trained models then output their predictions
    for labels at the highest taxonomic level for the genomes of the virus strains
    causing COVID-19\. The researchers then shifted the models to focus on the next,
    more specific taxonomic level and repeated the process again.

    which classified 153 viral sequences into four sub-genera and COVID-19, and then
    classified 76 viral sequences either as other Sarbecovirus types or as COVID-19.

    with other Coronaviridae and Betacoronavirus pathogens, but also that it has important
    similarities to other viruses found among bats. The researchers argue that their
    approach is faster (under 10 minutes, including 10-fold cross-validation) and
    can compare more, and more diverse, samples than previous analytic processes.
    While there may be insights here for the current pandemic, this kind of approach
    could be helpful in future outbreaks.

    the population as a whole into "compartments": those who are susceptible to the
    disease, infected, and removed (either recovered from the illness and presumably
    granted some degree of immunity, or no longer in the population because they died).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, generating such a model is never easy. Outbreak data can be impossible
    to gather accurately for many reasons, including institutional barriers, lack
    of testing, unknown or asymptomatic cases, and so forth. And, as we've seen, governments
    have implemented varied social distancing and isolation measures at different
    times, which can have unpredictable results on the number of people in that "susceptible"
    compartment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To deal with all the sources of uncertainty, [one group of researchers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029421v1.full.pdf)
    developed what they call an "eSIR" model -- an extended model including "a time-varying
    probability that a susceptible person meets an infected person or vice versa,"
    as well as a new compartment to include people who are susceptible but choose
    self-quarantine. Both of these factors would vary in specific regions based on
    when isolation protocols were implemented.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To further incorporate uncertainty into the model, the researchers used a Markov
    chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. (Here are two explanations for MCMC: [one
    simpler](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-zero-math-introduction-to-markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods-dcba889e0c50),
    [one more complex](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1015-8).)
    The MCMC approach allows for the approximation of a distribution that can''t be
    directly known -- like the true number of SARS-CoV-2 infections -- or that is
    too expensive to figure out. The eSIR model''s forecasts aim to reveal "turning
    points" in the outbreak. Turning points include when the daily number of new cases
    stops growing, and when the number of infected cases reaches its highest point.
    The model can also provide an estimate of the R[0].'

- en: The researchers are distributing an R package called eSIR that generates the
    models, ggplot2 objects, and summary statistics. What's useful about this approach
    is that it can help determine which quarantine strategies might be most useful
    and when. As the researchers say, "... too strict quarantine can cause backfire;
    people may lose their trust and patience in their committed system, and consequently
    may try to reduce compliance or even avoid quarantine." The risk of implementing
    strict quarantine systems for prolonged periods has to be weighed against the
    gains in disease prevention. This model provides one approach to that important
    calculation.

  prefs: []

    (The genomic and 'eSIR' studies described above are still "preprints," meaning
    they have not yet been peer-reviewed and have been released as quickly as possible
    to contribute to the scientific community's effort to address the pandemic.) It's
    truly impressive to see the creativity that researchers are applying to this crisis
    with such speed despite great stress, and it's inspiring for everyone as we seek
    solutions to many new challenges.

    to take action [based on insights from data](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Analytics-Blog/Creating-an-Analytic-Culture-for-Digital-Transformation/ba-p/412264).
    The great "flattening the curve" visualization and related forecasting seem to
    have had a strong impact on policymakers and the general public. Likewise, data
    experts need to be able to communicate about their analyses and models clearly
    -- for example, with [effective data visualizations](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Data-Science-Blog/A-Good-Honest-Chart-Coronavirus-Data-Visualizations-and-How/ba-p/547543)
    -- and organizations should build data literacy across all areas.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the research I reviewed frequently mentioned the challenge of getting
    quality COVID-19 data upon which to build good models. Even in normal times, it
    can be hard to get the kind and quality of data we need. Models for aspects of
    the pandemic -- or any other phenomenon -- are only as good as the data upon which
    they are built. Data abounds everywhere, but not all are trustworthy, usable,
    or relevant. Every organization needs solid data gathering, management, and analytics
    structures in place (as [these epidemiologists recommend](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200324-outbreak-science.pdf)
    for outbreaks). With that preparation, if a crisis of any kind emerges, your responses
    can be informed by accurate, relevant, up-to-date data readily at hand.
