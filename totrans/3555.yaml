- en: The Vowpal Wabbit (VW) is a project started at Yahoo! Research and now sponsored
    by Microsoft Research. Started and led by John Langford, VW focuses on fast learning
    by building an intrinsically fast learning algorithm. John gave two guest lectures
    to us on AllReduce and Bandits during NYU Big Data class this semester. From what
    I see, he is a reputed researcher and really passionate about online learning
    algorithm.

- en: The Vowpal Wabbit name is oddly pronounced and strange. Langford explained that
    Vowpal Wabbit is how Elmer Fudd would pronounce “Vorpal Rabbit”. As for “Vorpal”,
    if you Google it, you will find “Vorpal Bunny”, which is also known as a “killer
    rabbit” in a popular computer game. Maybe this is exactly what he wants VW to
    be – cute but also powerful and fast.

    of loss functions and optimization algorithms, like SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent),
    BFGS (a a popular algorithm for parameter estimation), conjugate gradient etc.
    It has been used to learn a sparse **terafeature** (i.e. 10^(12) sparse features)
    dataset on 1000 nodes in one hour, which beats all current machine linear learning
    algorithms. According to its tutorial on John Langford’s GitHub, VW is about a
    factor of 3 faster than [svmsgd](https://github.com/tpeng/svmsgd) on the RCV1
    example, which is a collection for text categorization.

- en: The format is also ideal for sparse representations since feature value of zero
    doesn’t need to be specified. If you are not sure whether the data is in the right
    format, you can always paste lines of the data in the [Data Format Validation](http://hunch.net/~vw/validate.html).
    VW is efficient and very scalable. To vectorize features it uses a hash trick,
    which takes almost no RAM and is 10 times faster since no hash-map table is maintained
    internally.

    find true love. It is John’s favorite app as he said on NIPS 2011. VW was also
    used for solving several Kaggle competitions. More information can be found on

- en: What is interesting about Vowpal is that it is fast because it does sampling,
    as it is a serial processing based method. This sampling is not done in the traditional
    way by sampling observations. Instead, they sample one feature at a time in the
    gradient descent – in what is stochastic gradient descent. So those in the machine
    learning community who criticize sampling also need to be aware that their own
    fast methods like Vowpal also clearly use sampling.

- en: The Vowpal results sometimes might be as accurate as traditional gradient descent
    methods in standard logistic regression, but are often substantially less accurate.
    In fact, it is probably possible to match the speed and accuracy performance in
    Vowpal with large numbers of observations by using standard logistic regression
    and simply sampling observations. As referenced below, the inventor of Vowpal
    – Langford, has recently been publishing on hybrid approaches that mix the stochastic
    gradient descent approach of Vowpal with traditional gradient descent approaches
    in logistic regression to try to increase accuracy. But these are now parallel
    processing methods in part. With parallel processing today, the issue of speed
    is much less important than it was a few years ago, but the other issues like
    reliability, accuracy, stability and absence of bias are still far more important.
    If sampling is done, the key is to make sure that it does not compromise accuracy
    as it did in the case of Vowpal which is why there has been a movement to new
    more accurate methods by its inventor.
