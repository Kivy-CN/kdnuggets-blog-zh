    GPU](https://www.sabrepc.com/NVIDIA-GPU-Solutions) accelerated libraries if you
    aren't doing so already. It wasn't until the late 2000s when AI projects became
    viable with the assistance of [neural networks](https://www.sabrepc.com/blog/Deep-Learning-and-AI/6-types-of-neural-networks-to-know-about) trained
    by GPUs to drastically speed up the process. Since that time, NVIDIA has been
    creating some of the best GPUs for deep learning, allowing GPU accelerated libraries
    to become a popular choice for AI projects.

    libraries is a great option. GPUs have significantly higher numbers of cores with
    plenty of memory bandwidth. This allows the GPU to perform parallel processing
    at high speeds – a must for the majority of machine learning projects.

    mathematical matrices needing to be parsed. The parallel processing power of NVIDIA
    GPUs allow them to effortlessly break down these matrices. Taking advantage of
    GPU accelerated libraries for your next AI project will ultimately be the quickest
    and most efficient solution.
