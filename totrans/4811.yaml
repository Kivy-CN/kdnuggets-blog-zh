- en: Natural language processing (NLP) is getting very popular today, which became
    especially noticeable in the background of the deep learning development. NLP
    is a field of artificial intelligence aimed at understanding and extracting important
    information from text and further training based on text data. The main tasks
    include speech recognition and generation, text analysis, sentiment analysis,
    machine translation, etc.

    be engaged in the natural language processing. Besides mathematics and machine
    learning, they should have been familiar with some key linguistic concepts. Now,
    we can just use already written NLP libraries. Their main purpose is to simplify
    the text preprocessing. We can focus on building machine learning models and hyperparameters
    fine-tuning.

    want to outline and compare the most popular and helpful natural language processing
    libraries, based on our experience. You should understand that all the libraries
    we look at have only partially overlapped tasks. So, sometimes it is hard to compare
    them directly. We will walk around some features and compare only those libraries,
    for which this is possible.

- en: In this article, we compared some features of several popular natural language
    processing libraries. While most of them provide tools for overlapping tasks,
    some use unique approaches for specific problems. Definitely, the most popular
    packages for NLP today are NLTK and Spacy. They are the main competitors in the
    NLP field. In our opinion, the difference between them lies in the general philosophy
    of the approach to solving problems.

- en: 'NLTK is more academic. You can use it to try different methods and algorithms,
    combine them, etc. Spacy, instead, provides one out-of-box solution for each problem.
    You don’t have to think about which method is better: the authors of Spacy already
    took care of this. Also, Spacy is very fast (several times faster than NLTK).
    One downside is the limited number of languages Spacy supports. However, the number
    of supported languages is increasing consistently. So, we think that Spacy would
    be an optimal choice in most cases, but if you want to try something special you
    can use NLTK.'

- en: Despite the popularity of these two libraries, there are many different options,
    and the choice which NLP package to choose depends on the specific problem you
    have to solve. So, if you happen to know other useful NLP library, please let
    our readers know in the comment section.
