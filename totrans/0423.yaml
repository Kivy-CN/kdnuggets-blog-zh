    Data Science Interview. However, there are a few things you can do for yourself
    to make the process easier.
  prefs: []

- en: Research the role and company
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning more about the role and the company you have applied for will help
    you a lot. Make sure you understand what the role is asking of you and if you
    fit that specification. It is better to over-perform than underperform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there are particular tasks laid out on the job description that you are unfamiliar
    with or need some brushing up on, you can use the time before your interview to
    prepare for that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Doing additional research on the company and its goals will impress the interviewer,
    as it shows you are eager to learn more about them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Strengths and Weaknesses
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding your strengths and weakness in your soft and hard skills will
    give you a better guide on what you need to improve on. Being honest with how
    good your technical skills are upfront about the skills you don’t have will give
    the interviewer a better understanding of where you can benefit the company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Saying yes to every skill will only put you in the deep end when you get the
    job and you’re asked to do a particular task that you have no experience in. Selling
    yourself is important, however, lying doesn’t help the process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don’t have a particular skill they are looking for but later on get offered
    a second interview, use that time to impress them by learning more about that
    skill.
  prefs: []

- en: Ask questions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interviewers like people who ask questions. It allows them to interact with
    you more, teach you about their company and learn the kind of person you are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These questions can be about the role you are interviewing for. Is it a replacement
    role? Will training be provided? What would my typical workday look like? How
    many people are there on the team? Who will I be working closely with? What kind
    of candidate is the company looking for?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You can also ask more personal questions such as: what do you like about the
    company? What do you think the company could improve?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of one another and if they are the right person for the role. There is no harm
    in asking questions, so ask away!
