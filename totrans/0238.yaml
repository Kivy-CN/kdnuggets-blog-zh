- en: Can we manage IT Operations with Machine Learning and AI by predicting major
    disruptive incidents on time and resolve it before a service outage happens, or
    would it be too complex to run IT Operations with algorithms? The answer is a
    cautious yes, we can run IT Operations with algorithms and make predictions. And
    here is why. As AI and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are catching up in this
    peculiar sector, increasing IT complexity creates the need and pressure to manage
    various business applications and IT infrastructure more efficiently and intelligently.
    So the answer to that need is of course Artificial Intelligence together with
    Machine Learning, or in other words Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations
    (AIOps).

    what AIOps is, how it provides seamless enterprise IT service to keep your lights
    on and how AI, Machine Learning and Data Science principles are used in order
    to do that. This article is just a first zoomed out, bird’s-eye view on AIOps.
    In the following blog posts, we will elaborate more on the technical background/details
    behind this approach.

- en: We call the work TOIL when it is tied to running a production service that tends
    to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and
    the one that scales linearly as services grow1\. TOIL will drain your IT team’s
    energy and time when they have to stay on top of massive volumes of data, alerts
    and tasks. Enterprises can have up to 10 million events per day2\. Therefore,
    the growing disconnect between large amounts of data, processes and the impact
    of monitoring on business calls for a new approach to managing and monitoring
    your IT infrastructure and services. Here is where AIOps comes into play.

    on the state of the IT infrastructure and systems is a must. Being able to insert
    the right data into your AI and Machine Learning models is important. Some fundamental
    IT infrastructure might be needed for that. We will discuss that in further detail
    with the next blog post on domain centric and domain agnostic AIOps platforms.
    The main message here is: AIOps needs to have good observability and visibility
    on every aspect of the IT infrastructure and all the applications connected to
    it, to capture and monitor the complex interactions between the IT services and
    applications in the entire IT landscape. Once a component is missing and is not
    monitored or observed, when it stops working properly, it becomes a daunting challenge
    to find the root cause since you do not have eyes and ears in that part. That
    being said, let’s look at how AIOps works.'

    the human out of the loop, on the contrary, it is there to help the human operators
    to manage the ever-increasing complexity in IT Operations. The IT complexity has

    and predict anomalies that could cause IT service issues like a service outage
    or major disruptive incidents. Furthermore, based on the predictions and advanced
    data processing, much accurate, dynamic thresholds, rules, statistical baselines,
    events and alerts can be created. In a later series of blog posts, we will delve
    much deeper in how these advanced, complicated processes are being realized.
