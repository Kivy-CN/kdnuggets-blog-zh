    scientists. I looked at general data science skills and at specific languages
    and tools separately. I searched job listings on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [SimplyHired](https://www.simplyhired.com/), [Monster](https://www.monster.com/),
    and [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs) on October 10, 2018\. Here’s a chart showing
    how many data scientist jobs each website listed.

    different contexts in job listings.

    the results were relevant for data scientist positions and affected all search
    terms similarly.

    than the number of positions. I excluded AngelList from both analyses because
    its search algorithm seems to operate as an *OR *type of logical search, without
    the ability to change it to an *AND*. AngelList works fine if you are looking
    for *“data scientist” “TensorFlow”* which is only going to be found with data
    scientist positions, but if your keywords are “*data scientist” “react.js”* it
    returns far too many listings for companies with non-data scientist job listings.

    analyses. The site stated that it had 26,263 *“data scientist”* jobs in the US,

    it would have more than three times the number of data scientist job listings
    as any other major platform.'

    For example, the best machine learning algorithms for most natural language processing
    problems are now deep learning algorithms. I expect deep learning skills will
    be sought more explicitly in the future and that machine learning will become
    more synonymous with deep learning.
