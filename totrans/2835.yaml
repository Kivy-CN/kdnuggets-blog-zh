- en: Today, advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) led solutions
    are capable of identifying specific game objects, constructs, players, events
    and actions. This aids in near real-time content discovery and helps sports producers
    create sports highlight packages automatically even when the game is in progress.
    Sports fans are always looking for new ways to engage with sports that bring them
    closer to the real-time action. Modern AI & ML technologies provide some truly
    immersive experiences that the fan demands.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To deliver the powerful experiences listed above, we need to be able to identify
    and tag sporting events exhaustively, and with high accuracy and speed. The more
    nuanced the tags, the richer the downstream use cases. Today the sports producers
    try to achieve this by deploying an army of operators who watch the game in real
    time and tag key attributes ferociously minute by minute. Then there are a number
    of editors who search these tags and to assemble the highlight clips. This operation
    is not scalable and hence the viewers finally could see a limited variety of highlights
    and sometimes after hours of actual action taking place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI & ML change the landscape drastically – by delivering required accuracy,
    variety, speed and scale. AI can detect actions fast and within seconds can create
    an exhaustive set of highlight packages to see the game in hundreds of different
    angles.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine Learning is based on the premise that a machine needs to be supplied
    with large volumes of training data to build a classification algorithm. Once
    the algorithm is built, it can predict results with the new set of data (test
    data). By this logic, if we feed the machine a lot of footage of a particular
    sport, it should begin to understand the sport’s actions. The reality is however
    quite different, as each sport is complex and unique. Even an uninitiated adult
    human would not be able to decipher a game like cricket, if he/she is just left
    with thousands of hours of match footage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'We need to therefore codify basic game logic & rules, and apply ML within a
    focused context for the machine to mimic human cognition. Let’s take the example
    of cricket to understand this better. While watching a cricket match, we decipher
    and appreciate the game through different elements in the match content. These
    are: 1) Our knowledge of the game actions like bowling, fielding, umpire signals
    etc. 2) On-screen graphics telling us the score highlights and the current state
    of the game 3) Sounds from the stadium like ball hitting bat, applause, appeal
    etc. and 4) Experts’ commentary.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To help machines understand the game like a human, we need to build a model
    based on these varied inputs. Typically, we deploy different kinds of neural networks
    as well as Computer Vision techniques to decipher various aspect of the four elements
    listed above. A wide variety of classification and cognition engines are used
    in tandem to “discern” the game from different perspectives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To train these engines, we need to sift through hundreds of hours of match footage
    and annotate different frames, objects, actions etc. and generate training data
    for ML. These cognition engines are then stitched together using game logic and
    understanding of sports production in order to catalogue the game, segment by
    segment. E.g. for cricket, we deploy more than 11 such engines to extract 25+
    attributes per ball including batsman, non-striker, bowler, runs scored, type
    of shot, fours, sixes, replays, crowd excitement levels, celebrations, wickets,
    bowling type, ball synopsis etc.

    metadata should be part of a search index that uses an advanced semantic search
    engine like Elastic Search. Techniques that help deliver sharper search results
    include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Key Entity Recognition, Stemming, Thesaurus,
    Fuzzy Logic and Duplication Removal.

- en: Once the AI engine catalogues a game thoroughly, the next challenge is to create
    instant highlight packages that capture the game’s key events and drama. For spectators,
    excitement levels typically peak during the high points of a game. For instance,
    in Soccer this could be when a goal is scored or missed. Visual clues like a referee/umpire
    signal or text overlay on screen also denote key events. A highlight creation
    engine can tap these high points and attributes to create a simple highlight package.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But creating compelling highlights involves much more. For instance, a good
    cricket match highlight package is not just a combination of fours, sixes and
    wickets. The human editor artfully cuts a package that captures suspense, comedy,
    drama and tells a compelling story. If a batsman is beaten a couple of times before
    being out, the editor shows all 3 balls – not just the last one. Other elements
    like tournament montages, pre-match ceremony, player entry, toss of coin etc.
    also need to be learned and included in highlights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI-generated highlights is created using learnable business rules that are built
    from past match highlight productions. These need to be improved over time as
    the engine learns what works better and what does not. These rules are based on
    comprehensive attributes/tags for each match segment. Much like a human editor,
    machines can also bring in AI-based audio smoothening, scene transitions between
    two segments, smooth commentary cuts etc., so that human editors need to put in
    minimal effort to do Quality Check (QC) and finishing.

- en: No two sports are alike. Given the complexities of each sport, producers cannot
    use off-the-shelf, 3rd party video recognition engines from the likes of Google,
    Microsoft and IBM Watson to tag content, discover meaningful clips or create highlights.
    One needs to build and train custom models to tag sports content effectively.
    Also, specific models need to be built for specific sports – incorporating game
    logic, expert methods and historical learning. This is a painstaking process,
    but any attempt to create a generic sport model is likely to fail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each sport is also produced differently. For example, in Soccer a movement towards
    a goal is shown as a combination of long and close-up shots taken from different
    camera angles. For cricket or baseball, the camera tries to keep the ball in the
    middle of the frame while the batsman is hitting. We need to train our engines
    with specific knowledge of these nuances and production techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, producers need to swiftly publish highlight clips to platforms like Facebook,
    Twitter and YouTube, for which they need game tagging and highlights generation
    to take place quickly. AI engines with both on-premise and cloud hosting capabilities
    can help achieve the necessary speed.

    and in personalised ways. Application and adoption of AI/ML is the only way to
    deliver these expectations. And there is no short cut. AI-led specific custom
    models for each sport to be deployed at scale and fine tunes for several months
    to achieve expected results. Like all other fields, AI will finally help automate
    routine tasks, enabling human resources to focus their intellect on far more creative
    pursuits.
