    or application showing up in our feed. At the core of AI algorithms lies the data,
    in the form of numbers. So, let’s talk about the impact of AI in our lives through
    numbers aka the statistics. Around 77% of devices leverage AI. One of the major
    uses of AI, specifically the emergence of Generative AI in conversing in human-like
    language has enabled 85% of AI users to use it for creating content.

    72% of retailers employing AI, and 63% of the IT and telecom sector using it.
    Undoubtedly, it brings remarkable benefits. Take, for example, Netflix which saves
    $1B using machine learning techniques. But, there is another side to such automation
    and advancements, i.e. replacing the human workforce. Reportedly, intelligent
    robots can impact 30% of the global workforce by 2030, impacting 375M careers.

    developers in software development by suggesting auto-completion, writing boilerplate
    code, detecting syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, etc. However, like many
    other uses of AI, it is recommended to leverage them to augment the developers’
    productivity; over-reliance on code assistants to write production-grade code
    must be avoided.

    number of vulnerable systems or devices per organization, diverse attack vectors,
    a shortage of cyber-skilled professionals, and an overwhelming amount of data.
    A self-learning, AI-based cybersecurity system could tackle these challenges by
    continuously gathering and analyzing data from enterprise systems, providing intelligence
    across areas such as IT asset inventory, threat exposure, control effectiveness,
    breach risk prediction, fast incident response, and explainability of the model.

    the context very well. This contextual learning involves a nuanced understanding
    of language, curating a well-formed response that elevates customer experience,
    and cutting down on time to resolve the query. Gen-AI assistants are able to engage
    in more natural and fluid conversations leading to a more personalized response.

    on behalf of the users to apply their custom layer that could cater to their needs.
    That’s a big driver of using AI in that it speaks directly to the specific user
    and adapts to their characteristics. While the benefits are many, right from predicting
    customer behavior, recommendations, content creation, and report generation to
    infusing AI into existing tech products to streamline user workflows and processes,
    there is another side to this shiny story of AI advancements.

- en: The rapid integration of AI into business processes has raised concerns about
    job displacements. The use of AI in automating the repetitive and routine tasks
    traditionally performed by humans. has led to the displacement of jobs in industries
    such as manufacturing, retail, customer service, and administrative roles. Not
    all sectors and occupations are impacted uniformly, in fact, there are new jobs
    created too. Profiles like prompt engineers, AI ethicists, Responsible AI and
    Compliance Officers, and AI auditors are fast emerging in the AI-driven economy.

    routine work are facing greater challenges in adapting to technological changes.
    Policymakers, businesses, and other stakeholders must come together to address
    these challenges and mitigate the negative impacts on workers and society as a
    whole. This includes organizing training programs, embedding lifelong learning
    initiatives, and promoting new job creation in emerging industries.

    are concerned too. The goodness of AI algorithms largely depends on the underlying
    data they are trained on. Such data may include user information or sensitive
    details, such as PII (Personal Identifiable Information). Recently, the news has
    surfaced of companies using users’ data to train their models without asking for
    any explicit consent. Such unauthorized use of personal data breaches users’ privacy
    rights and is a big concern when it comes to using AI systems.

    just the users but also for the developers to understand the reasoning behind
    the model response. Hence, organizations must put concerted efforts into building
    responsible AI that respects data privacy and promotes model transparency. While
    AI offers promising benefits such as increased efficiency and the ability to innovate
    novel solutions, it's crucial to address user and workforce concerns responsibly
    to fully tap into its potential.
