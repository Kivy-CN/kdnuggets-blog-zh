    of change managers. We discussed the social effects of predictive maintenance
    on the workforce and how to deal with the implementation of this concept from
    a change management perspective. At the end of the lecture I came to realize that
    it''s the data scientist who should know about change management rather than the
    other way around. This might make the implementation of the improvements found
    by data scientists much more efficient since this tackles behavioral change: One
    of the biggest hurdles in implementation of our ideas and realizing our goals.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Change management may be seen as a domain opposed to data science. Data science
    is hard, change is soft. Change management is not about the solution of messy
    problems but about the process of change, data science is all about the solution
    after getting our the messy data. One of the core ideas of change management is
    that the change comes as part of a process and not at a sudden, let alone predicted,
    time. Change comes from within peoples' acceptance to change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the models of change management that we discussed during my lecture states
    that "*Change is the result of a change in behavior due to the reaction on a new
    reality that exists due to interventions.*" Change is a result not the starting
    point. Goals are what you are heading for and change is needed to reach those.
    But to reach it one must think retroactive, back to the point where interventions
    need to be implemented to create the new reality.

    it starts out working with the ones that are to react on this new reality. I conclude
    that is might be effective for us data scientists to embrace the concept of change
    management and seek collaboration with this methodology before implementing our
    results.'

- en: Let me illustrate my ideas by elaborating on a specific case. Let us imagine
    a factory producing a not-too-complex product. Maintenance and overhaul is performed
    by the technical department. Every day coworkers on production line and employees
    from maintenance department work with the machinery and as such they *know and
    sense* the state of the devices. Take James, a 45 year old maintenance engineer
    who has worked at this company for more than 25 years. He feels whether maintenance
    of a machine is needed simply by twisting bolts and arms. Of course machinery
    sometimes fails, but hey - it happens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now predictive maintenance comes in. Data scientists take their seats and start
    working on prediction of upcoming maintenance before anyone could sense that the
    machinery would fail. Note that the intention to start doing data science within
    the organization *is* an intervention in itself. At the end of the project indeed
    for many machines a predictive model is created that predicts failure of a component
    3 weeks ahead with 97% accuracy. Predictions say that a reduction of production
    failure of 85% is in reach.

    Behavior may need to change, but there is a bigger issue: Predictive maintenance
    is a change of reality. In the old reality machinery was put to maintenance at
    the point that something was bound to fail, or indeed in case of preventive maintenance,
    machinery was put to maintenance periodically. In the new reality, machinery is
    potentially put up for servicing by an algorithm even before human sense skills
    could do so. In the new reality things are fixed that aren''t broken yet.'

    in demand?*"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Successful implementation of predictive maintenance thus is the result of a
    change in behavior due to the reaction on a new reality. The challenge is to not
    only focus on the core data science project but get the new reality accepted.
    This requires a range of interventions parallel or even before data science kicks
    in.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what are best practices of change management and how should they be used?
    The first thing to acknowledge is that the change starts even before the data
    scientists start their analysis. Any project that contains smart predictive algorithms,
    intervenes with smart and skilled employees. Therefore, engage with these employees
    before showing any results. Project managers may assume that people want to contribute
    to something bigger than themselves. In case of predictive maintenance, striving
    for zero production failures due may inspire more than it repels.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next thing is to realize that domain knowledge needs to be part of a data science
    project. Therefore, engage employees from the work floor in the project, let them
    share what they know about the machinery or any subject under analysis. In doing
    so, your employees' skills get acknowledged. They know that you know that they
    are skilled. The importance of being heard cannot be underestimated.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Also, during the project at and the end of the project test with your skilled
    employees. Challenge your employees to get acquainted with the prediction algorithms.
    Moreover, let them compete men versus machine: Who knows which machines needs
    service the most efficient.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, focus on the bigger picture. implementing data science in any company
    is not about ousting employees, it is about doing the things we do more effective
    and more efficient. My expectation is that there will always be a need for skilled
    employees after implementation.
