- en: After working on the machine learning project, it's time to showcase how well
    your model is performing. You can either create a front-end application or use
    REST API. With the introduction of Streamlit, Gradio, and FAST API, creating front-end
    applications has become hassle-free. These web frameworks require a few lines
    of code to create an interactive user interface. Sharing your work with the public
    helps you create a strong data science portfolio. It also helps non-technical
    individuals to understand your project. So, after building the web app, it is
    time to deploy the app to the cloud server.

- en: '[**Spaces**](https://huggingface.co/spaces) have become a new sensation in
    the machine learning community. I use this platform to deploy almost every machine
    learning demo. It has an easy-to-deploy option using Git and provides beginners
    friendly solutions for the environment and Python packages related issues. Spaces
    allows you to deploy Streamlit, Gradio, and HTML-based web applications. It is
    fast and reliable with longer server uptime. You don’t even have to upload the
    models or data. It provides seamless integration with Hugging Face Dataset and
    Models. Furthermore, Gradio allows us to save and update a flagging dataset using
    a callback, which is quite an exciting feature.'

    find web applications on computer vision, audio, natural language processing,
    tabular, and even simple dashboards. You can keep your application private or
    share it with the public. The best part about the platform is that it offers you
    so many features without any cost. Hugging Face is truly democratizing machine
    learning.

    private and unlimited public Streamlit application for free. The platform offers
    a one-click deployment option using GitHub integration. In short, you will be
    pushing your code to the GitHub repository, and the Streamlit cloud will automatically
    detect changes and rebuild the server. Apart from it, you get to enjoy secure
    integration with the data sources, authentication, collaboration on the Streamlit
    project, and up to 1 GB of storage.'

    web framework. With every new version, the platform is getting better in terms
    of speed, uptime, and accessibility. It is beginner-friendly and offers hassle-free
    deployment.

    all kinds of web applications. You can start small and then scale the project
    with time. Heroku supports the most popular programming languages, databases,
    and web frameworks. Furthermore, you can find tons of integrations for logging,
    email notifications, testing, dashboard, image processing, and DevOps.'

- en: My first experience with the hosting service was with Heroku, and I find it
    quite easy to modify and deploy the change to the server. You can deploy your
    app using GitHub integration, Heroku CLI, and Git remote. I stopped using it due
    to its storage limitations, but I still consider it one of the top hosting platforms
    for data applications. Easy to use and multiple integrations make it into my top
    three go-to platforms for web developments.

    you with its flavor of SQL database and large storage service. Other than that,
    you can also schedule runs, custom domains, and add API keys.'

    and powerful features provided by Deta CLI and server. I have even written a blog
    on it: [Deploying Your First Machine Learning API](/2021/10/deploying-first-machine-learning-api.html).
    It took me 5 minutes to understand the docs, install CLI, and deploy my machine
    learning application. If you want to create your machine learning microservice
    and start your own company, then Deta is the best place to start.'

    share their projects related to games, web designing, building microservice, and
    even creating a new framework.'

- en: How does it help us build machine learning applications? In every project, you
    are allowed to run a temporary server and host your application with a public
    URL. For example, create a FastAPI machine learning application, and when you
    press the run button, it will automatically start a web server with a URL that
    you can share. You can keep the server on by using ping hacks or buy the Pro version.

- en: Currently, I am running four reinforcement bots, three NLP chatbots, and one
    FastAPI project. You can create and deploy your app all at one place without even
    thinking about dependencies or development issues. It is my go-to platform to
    try new things and test APIs. If you are a coding beginner and want to get into
    the world of machine learning, then start with Replit.
