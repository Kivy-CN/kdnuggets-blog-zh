    because data science courses typically cover a wide range of topics—from programming
    to data analysis, visualization, and more—it takes several weeks to work through
    them. And even if they start strong, most learners start feeling overwhelmed after
    the first few modules and fail to make progress. **Enter Kaggle (micro)courses. **'

    a good alternative if you find longer courses harder to get through. They are
    great resources to learn data science skills—Python, pandas, machine learning,
    and more—without feeling overwhelmed. The courses are designed such that they
    take only a few hours to finish, and include tutorial and practice components.
    Now let's go over some beginner-friendly courses and what they cover.
