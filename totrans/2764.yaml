    We have been highlighting a new such installment weekly for the better part of
    the past few months, doing our best to single out and share top learning materials
    for those stuck at home right now, or really for anyone interested in learning
    a new concept or brushing up on what they already know.

    (AutoML), a personal favorite of mine. What is automated machine learning? It
    is a wide (and widening) concept, but I''ve [previously](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-machine-learning-business-matthew-mayo/)
    tried to capture its essence as such:'

    computer programming is about automation, and machine learning is "all about automating
    automation," then automated machine learning is "the automation of automating
    automation." Follow me, here: programming relieves us by managing rote tasks;
    machine learning allows computers to learn how to best perform these rote tasks;
    automated machine learning allows for computers to learn how to optimize the outcome
    of learning how to perform these rote actions.'

    parameters and hyperparameters, automated machine learning systems can learn the
    best way to tune these for optimal outcomes by a number of different possible
    methods.

    Systems, Challenges](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-05318-5)**
    edited by Frank Hutter, Lars Kotthoff, and Joaquin Vanschoren, is a collection
    of chapters which cover the hows and whys of contemporary automated machine learning,
    presents some of the available tools for the doing of AutoML, and discusses some
    of its challenges.'

    we need in AutoML (hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, and neural architecture
    search), provides in-depth discussions of existing AutoML systems, and thoroughly
    evaluates the state of the art in AutoML in a series of competitions that ran
    since 2015\. As such, I highly recommend this book to any machine learning researcher
    wanting to get started in the field and to any practitioner looking to understand
    the methods behind all the AutoML tools out there.

    and sometimes even outperform human machine learning experts. Put simply, AutoML
    can lead to improved performance while saving substantial amounts of time and
    money, as machine learning experts are both hard to find and expensive. As a result,
    commercial interest in AutoML has grown dramatically in recent years, and several
    major tech companies are now developing their own AutoML systems.

- en: If you have little to no understanding of what automated machine learning is
    in practice, don't worry. The book starts off with a solid introduction to the
    topic, and lays out explicitly what you can expect chapter by chapter, which is
    important in a book comprised of independent separate chapters. After this, in
    first section of the book, you get right in to reading about the important topics
    of contemporary AutoML, and be confident of this since the book was put together
    in 2019\. Hyperparameter optimization is undoubtedly the bread and butter of automated
    machine learning techniques, so you set off with that first. This is followed
    up with the broader topic of meta-learning, or the observance of how machine learning
    approaches comparatively perform on varying learning tasks. Lastly, neural architecture
    search is tackled, which is the practice of automatically identifying the optimal
    neural network architecture construction for a given task.

- en: Learning about these topics is great, but how about rolling up your sleeves
    and getting your hands dirty? The next section is a walkthrough of a half dozen
    tools for implementing these AutoML concepts. There are some Python libraries
    and a standalone GUI-based application to have a look at here. I would suggest
    choosing a single library and diving deep on it. There will be trade-offs between
    approaches, but the idea that anyone should learn, for example, 4 or 5 AutoML
    libraries right away is not helpful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last section is an analysis of the AutoML Challenge Series that existed
    for a few years during 2015 to 2018, the time that interest in automated approaches
    to machine learning seemed to explode. The insights learned from overseeing a
    competition on implementing fully automated machine learning systems definitely
    hold value for a practitioner, and so this chapter should not be skipped.
  prefs: []

    This book can set you off on the right path, and I recommend it to anyone looking
    for such a book.
