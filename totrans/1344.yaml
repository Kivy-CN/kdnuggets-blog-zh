- en: '**Widespread Salary Cuts May Decrease Median Salaries**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to the prevalence of salary cuts impacting data science & analytics teams
    this year, we may see downward pressure on salaries impacting next year’s data.
    Bonuses are also likely to be negatively impacted.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the moment, we are not seeing any evidence of job offers being lower than
    expected as a result of the current crisis. From what we’ve seen, larger companies
    at least are currently staying within their prescribed salary bands. However,
    as this crisis continues, it is possible that will change, which could have an
    effect on 2021 salaries. With the prevalence of layoffs and furloughs disrupting
    the career plans of many candidates, this may also have an impact on their ability
    to negotiate higher salaries, which has the potential to flatten salary increases,
    at least temporarily.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many industries and companies are being hugely disrupted as a result of COVID-19,
    and the market will likely continue to shift as some organizations that were more
    “downstream” from the immediate impact of the crisis are now starting to lay off
    their staff, including some consulting firms, ad agencies, industrial, software,
    financial services, etc.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the disruption to childcare and school closings, we’ve been hearing from
    some managers that they’re seeing an increase in requests for reduced or modified
    schedules, which could, in turn, have an impact on salaries.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those companies that are hiring, we are seeing a much faster interview process
    because it’s easier to schedule. With vacations and travel mostly on hold and
    many candidates still working from home, there is more flexibility, especially
    since back-to-back on-site interview schedules can now potentially be more spread
    out to accommodate different schedules.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of the current prevalence of remote work, this has quickened start time
    for candidates that would have typically taken 5 weeks to relocate. Employers
    have been shipping computers to get talent on board faster to tackle data projects
    immediately, and in many cases, relocation has been postponed due to safety concerns.

    Hiring Process
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that the interview process has largely shifted to be entirely virtual,
    we are seeing more of an emphasis to evaluate a candidate’s technical skills earlier
    in the process, often even before a scheduled interview with a hiring manager.
    This could include technical screenings, along with case study presentations.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While some industries and companies are finding themselves in an advantageous
    position if they have products or services that have increased in demand as a
    result of the COVID-19 crisis, some have found themselves struggling to adapt
    their business models with travel restrictions, lockdowns, and rapid shifts in
    demand. Industries such as retail, travel, or hospitality may lose jobs, or areas
    like tech may increase, so we’ll be keeping a close eye on industry demographic
    data to see whether we can identify any such changes in our 2021 report.

    Offices?'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the increase in startups going under and some companies announcing permanent
    WFH strategies, it is likely that the movement of candidates out of the West Coast
    will accelerate. This is particularly affecting areas like the Bay Area and Seattle,
    which was already underway in recent years as a result of the high cost of living
    and lack of affordable housing. This could impact salaries if professionals move
    to lower cost of living areas and, as a result, receive lower salaries. It is
    also yet to be seen whether lockdown restrictions and avoidance of public transit
    coupled with a more favorable remote work environment could favor suburban offices.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For some teams, the crisis has had a positive impact on their hiring. The talent
    that potential employers would not otherwise have access to may be available if
    they find themselves laid off, furloughed, or otherwise open to making a change
    because of industry uncertainty. We’re already seeing an increase in private equity
    groups, in the interest of accurately timing business decisions, who have been
    picking up additional analytics talent throughout the crisis.

    to the cloud for their data needs. As a result, experience with cloud computing
