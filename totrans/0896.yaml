    arithmetic, and indexing. You will also learn to wrangle data with libraries like
    dplyr and create plots to visualize data.

    with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python)
    offered for free by Harvard. In this course, you will learn concepts like functions,
    arguments, variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, objects, methods,
    and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both programs above are self-paced. However, the Python course is more detailed
    than the R program, and requires a longer time commitment to complete. Also, the
    rest of the courses in this roadmap are taught in R, so it might be worth learning
    R to be able to follow along easily.
