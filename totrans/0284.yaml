    advance in machine learning which has been achieving amazing successes, a founding
    Director of [ NYU Center for Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu/), and was recently
    appointed the Director of the AI Research Lab at Facebook.'

    time. We will have machines that, without being very smart, will do useful things,
    like drive our cars autonomously.'

- en: 'How long will it take? AI researchers have a long history of under-estimated
    the difficulties of building intelligent machines. I''ll use an analogy: making
    progress in research is like driving a car to a destination. When we find a new
    paradigm or a new set of techniques, it feels like we are driving a car on a highway
    and nothing can stop us until we reach the destination. ![Self-Driving Car](../Images/731890c72cb3cc801426748a40a0604c.png)'

    that our highway is really a parking lot with a brick wall at the far end. Many
    smart people have made that mistake, and every new wave in AI was followed by
    a period of unbounded optimism, irrational hype, and a backlash. It happened with
    "perceptrons", "rule-based systems", "neural nets", "graphical models", "SVM",
    and may happen with "deep learning", until we find something else. But these paradigms
    were never complete failures. They all left new tools, new concepts, and new algorithms.

    do believe we will eventually build machines that will rival humans in intelligence,
    I don''t really believe in the singularity. We feel like we are on an exponentially
    growing curve of progress. But we could just as well be on a sigmoid curve. Sigmoids
    very much feel like exponentials at first. Also, the singularity assumes more
    than an exponential, it assumes an asymptote. The difference between dynamic evolutions
    that follow linear, quadratic, exponential, asymptotic, or sigmoidal shapes are
    damping or friction factors. Futurists seem to assume that there will be no such
    damping or friction terms. Futurists have an incentive to make bold predictions,
    particularly when they really want them to be true, perhaps in the hope that they
    will be self-fulfilling.'

    possibly the most famous probability theorist in the world. NYU has initiated
    a search for a new permanent director. I have invested a huge amount of energy
    into the creation of CDS. We now have an MS program in Data Science, and will
    soon have a PhD program. We have 9 open faculty positions for the center, we have
    won a very large, five-year grant from the Moore and Sloan foundations in collaboration
    with Berkeley and University of Washington, we have a partnership with Facebook
    and other companies, we will soon have a new building. The next director is going
    to have all the fun!

    as an intersection of Statistics, Hacking, and Domain/Business Knowledge. How
    is Data Science different from previous terms like "Data Mining" and "Predictive

    of knowledge from data. This concept permeates many disciplines, each of which
    has a different name for it, including statistical estimation, data mining, predictive
    analytics, system identification, machine learning, AI, etc.'

- en: On the methods side, statistics, machine learning, and certain branches of applied
    mathematics could all claim to "own" the field of data science. But in reality,
    Data Science is to Statistics, Machine Learning, and Applied Math as Computer
    Science was to Electrical Engineering, Physics, and Mathematics in the 1960s.
    The same way computer science became a full-fledged disciplined, rather than a
    sub-field of mathematics or engineering is its importance to society.

- en: With the exponential growth of data generated by our digital world, the problem
    of automatically extracting knowledge from data is growing rapidly. This is causing
    the emergence of Data Science as a discipline. It is causing a redrawing of the
    boundaries between Statistics, Machine Learning, and Applied Mathematics. It is
    also creating a need for tight interactions between "methods" people and "domain"
    people in science, business, medicine, and government.

    big data to teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do

- en: There is hype, to be sure. But the problem of how to collect, store and analyze
    massive amounts of data is very real. I'm always suspicious of names like "big
    data", because today's "big data" is tomorrow's "little data". Also, there are
    many important problem that arise because of too little data. It is the often
    the case for genomics and medical data. There is never enough data.
