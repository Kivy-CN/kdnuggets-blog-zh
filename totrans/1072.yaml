- en: 'Several top universities offer traditional graduate-level programs in data
    science. Because these are graduate-level programs, most will require an undergraduate
    degree in an analytical field such as physics, mathematics, accounting, business,
    computer science, or engineering. These programs typically have a duration of
    3 to 4 semesters for those who pursue full-time enrollment. Traditional programs
    come in different flavors such: Data Science Master’s, Data Analytics Master’s,
    or Business Analytics Masters. The cost of tuition for traditional face-to-face
    programs could be anywhere in the range of $15,000 to $40,000, not including living
    expenses. Thus, before pursuing a traditional college degree, do well to ask yourself
    the following questions:'

    of online programs is that it is less costly and does not require relocation.
    Most online master’s program in data science or business analytics can be completed
    on average between 18 to 24 months. The cost for online data science master’s
    programs can be anywhere from $13,000 to $40,000.

- en: There are so many excellent massive open online courses (MOOCs) in data science
    on platforms such as edX, Coursera, DataCamp, Udacity, and Udemy. The courses
    offered could be standalone courses, or in the form of specializations (professional
    certificate) or MicroMasters. These are offered by top universities such as Harvard,
    MIT, University of Michigan, Boston College, The University of Adelaide, University
    of California San Diego, University of California, Berkeley, etc. These programs
    are cheaper and affordable, and you can take courses at your own pace. The professional
    certificate and MicroMasters program costs are typically in the range from $600
    to $1,500.

- en: In summary, we’ve discussed three possible pathways to data science. If you
    want, put in four years at a college (or more at a graduate school). This will
    give you a deeper understanding of the field, but if your circumstances don’t
    allow you to pursue a college degree, you can (with some passion and dedication)
    teach yourself data science through self-study. MOOCs provide great courses on
    a variety of data science topics, at a fraction of the price you pay for a traditional
    program. By dedicated  the right amount of time and energy, you can learn the
    fundamentals of data science via MOOC specializations and MicroMasters.
