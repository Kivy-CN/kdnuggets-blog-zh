- en: Data scientists and data engineers are commonly confused by beginners without
    any significant experience in data science. And while their jobs might seem similar
    at a glance, there are actually some significant underlying differences. If you’re
    considering a career in data science, it’s important to understand how these two
    fields differ, and which one might be more appropriate for someone with your skills
    and interests.

    are involved with the direct analytical side of things. They work on models to
    process data, propose solutions to specific problems, and explore the limits of
    the data science domain to look for appropriate ways to tackle challenges. The
    work of a data scientist involves a lot of math and a deep understanding of the
    statistical concepts behind data science. A strong mathematical and statistical
    background is necessary to progress as a data scientist, and even to get hired
    by a reputable company.'

    hand, is more concerned with the actual technical implementation of solutions.
    Once a scientist has come up with a model, it’s up to the engineer to figure out
    how to integrate it into the overall data processing pipeline. Data engineers
    have to be careful to maintain a balance between accessibility, flexibility and
    performance of the systems they work on.

- en: They also have to understand the tech stack they are working with as completely
    as possible. When a solution is to be implemented, it’s up to the data engineers
    to determine what languages, databases, and other pieces of technology should
    be used to put together the final result. A good deal of scripting is usually
    required to tie everything together.

- en: A good way to look at data scientists and data engineers is via the analogy
    of architects and civil engineers. Architects are the ones that come up with the
    initial plans, while engineers implement them while observing structural limitations
    and other similar points. It’s not too different in the world of data science.
    Data scientists plan and data engineers build and implement.

- en: The two roles work closely together to come up with the final solutions though.
    It’s important to have good communication skills on both sides, because it’s often
    necessary to consolidate ideas and limitations, and this has to be done in a way
    that doesn’t undermine anyone’s involvement in the project. Good pairs of data
    scientists and engineers can prove invaluable in the chaotic environment that
    this work is usually done in.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Choosing whether you want to work as a data scientist or data engineer is important
    if you want to get involved with data science in general. If you enjoy math and
    exploring the theoretical concepts in the field, working as a data scientist might
    be more suitable for you. You’ll need a good understanding of statistics, linear
    algebra, and various other mathematical fields. You’ll also need to go through
    lots of published papers to gain a good understanding of how the field is tied
    together as a whole.

- en: On the other hand, if you like to “get your hands dirty”, and often find yourself
    writing scripts to automate your work, rearranging parts of a pipeline to make
    it more efficient, and worrying about technical limitations, then working as a
    data engineer might be right up your alley. This is a very technical field, and
    you don’t necessarily need a good understanding of the mathematical basics to
    be successful in it. It can definitely help though.

- en: No matter which side you choose, it’s still a good idea to spend some time familiarizing
    yourself with concepts on both ends. A good data engineer must have at least some
    idea of how the models they’re implementing came to be in the first place, while
    a good data scientist must be aware of the rough limitations they can expect to
    encounter. That’s why the best specialists in those fields usually try to invest
    at least some effort into learning how the other side works. This will also prove
    very useful when trying to communicate a difficult concept.

- en: Whether you’re going to focus on one side first and then pick up the other later,
    or if you’re going to spread your attention between the two initially is up to
    you. Both approaches can work, and it’s a matter of personal preference. Whatever
    track you choose, Springboard has offerings in both that can deepen your understanding
    and get you job ready in the field you’re interested in. Springboard’s [Data Science
    Career Track](https://www.springboard.com/courses/data-science-career-track/?utm_medium=taggedreferral&utm_source=kdnuggets&utm_campaign=ds_d_eng_work_together)

    things.
