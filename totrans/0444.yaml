    into a bootcamp. I’ve been trying to land a data science job for months, but to
    no avail. I either get no response at all, or companies tell me that I don’t have
    the kind of experience they’re looking for.*'

    common messages I get. Individuals from different backgrounds trying to break
    into data science but are unable to land a job in the industry.

    of getting a job in the industry, or if there were any specific courses they could
    do that would look good on their resume.

    might be struggling to land a data science job. There is a lot of misconception
    surrounding the data industry, and I’d like to clear some of them up in this article.

    This person did a bootcamp and had been applying to data science job positions
    for a couple of months. Their application either kept getting rejected or ignored,
    and they were unable to make it to the interview stage.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only relevant data science education they had was their bootcamp certificate.
    They did have multiple data science projects listed on their resume, but in just
    a glance, it became apparent to me that all these projects were done during the
    course of their bootcamp.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for the same entry-level position. A certificate from a bootcamp or an online
    course isn’t going to be enough to do that.

- en: The ***skills ***section of your resume doesn’t have a lot of the skillset required
    to work as a data scientist. You mainly listed machine learning Python packages
    and visualization tools, and it looks like all those things were also taught at
    the bootcamp.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your bootcamp. Recruiters are going to know this, especially if all graduates
    of the same bootcamp have similar projects listed.

- en: The problem lies in bootcamps and online courses that promise to make you a
    data scientist in the next couple of months. The problem lies in data science
    bloggers and YouTubers who constantly craft a narrative of how they managed to
    land a data science job easily, and make it seem like you can do it too with little
    effort.

    People have done it before. But it **definitely isn’t easy**. And if you want
    to do it without any kind of formal training, then be prepared to put in at least
    three times the work.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first is by the gatekeepers, who strongly believe that you need to have
    a strong academic foundation or at least a PhD to become a data scientist.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second is by educators who insist that anyone can become a data scientist
    as long as they take an online course or bootcamp.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Neither of these are true. The answer lies somewhere in the middle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is great to have a Masters degree or some kind of formal data science training,
    but not everyone has the privilege or time to do so. If this is the case, then
    it is possible to teach yourself data science. But not through a single bootcamp
    or online course.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science isn’t a field with a pre-defined path. There isn’t a fixed set
    of topics for you to learn because the field is constantly changing. The job scope
    of a data scientist comes with varying responsibilities. Due to this, there is
    no fixed course or bootcamp that can make you a data scientist. You need to constantly
    learn on your own, and the learning never ends.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to take the initiative to learn many of these things on your own. Build
    projects that you think would help solve a company’s problem. Learn more than
    one programming language, some model deployment, data collection, cloud computing,
    and machine learning, and then you’ll be on your way to becoming a data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, there is a difference between generalized and specialized data scientists,
    but most data science jobs these days require you to have some knowledge of everything
    I listed above.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    employees that you have the ability and technical depth required to learn these
    things on the job.

    focus from data science.
  prefs: []

    is unfortunately the case for most people out there.
  prefs: []

    their resume.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    analyst, or consultant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They had some technical background from everything they learnt at the bootcamp,
    and also worked in the field of marketing for some time. They had a combination
    of domain expertise and technical knowledge that would work in their favour.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most data analysts I’ve encountered are excellent at working with data, but
    fall short when it comes to deriving business value due to their lack of marketing
    expertise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I suggested to this person that if they needed a job soon, they could start
    out as an analyst. They would learn a lot from working with data on a daily basis,
    and could continue learning data science on the side.
  prefs: []

    transition to data science over time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    degree to land a data science job, and how it is possible to enter the industry
    with no formal qualification.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And while I still stand by this, I believe that these articles might also have
    played a part in downplaying the amount of effort required to become a data scientist.
    I might have made it sound too easy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It takes time and effort to achieve a certain level of expertise at any subject.
    Data science is no different. There is no specific course or bootcamp that will
    completely prepare you for a data science job.
  prefs: []

- en: Again, data science courses are incredibly helpful, but they only help lay the
    foundation. The heavy lifting needs to be done by you.
  prefs: []

- en: Over the past year, I have spent time learning the foundation of statistics,
    machine learning, data collection, web development, programming, database manipulation,
    model deployment, and business analytics. I am currently working towards becoming
    Google Cloud Data Engineer Certified, despite the fact that we don’t use GCP at
    my workplace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    could offer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are a beginner to the data industry, this article isn’t meant to scare
    or demotivate you. There are just so many misconceptions around data science,
    and the industry has become so highly commercialized these days.
