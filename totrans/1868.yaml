    methods, called algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's helpful to think about an algorithm as a recipe and your data as the ingredients.
    An algorithm tells how to combine and mix the data in order to get an answer.
    Computers are like a blender. They do most of the hard work of the algorithm for
    you and they do it pretty fast.

    Your credit card company analyzes your purchase patterns, so that they can alert
    you to possible fraud. Charges that are "weird" might be a purchase at a store

    For this question, you don’t have examples that you already know outcomes for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a lot of ways to tease out the structure of data. One approach is
    clustering. It separates data into natural "clumps," for easier interpretation.
    With clustering there is no one right answer.

  prefs: []

    to punishment and rewards. These algorithms learn from outcomes, and decide on
    the next action.
