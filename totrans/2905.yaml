- en: As demonstrated by many researchers [1, 2], the use of Machine Learning (ML)
    in Medicine is nowadays becoming more and more important. Researchers are now
    using ML in applications such as EEG analysis and Cancer Detection/Analysis. For
    example, by examining biological data such as DNA methylation and RNA sequencing
    can then be possible to infer which genes can cause cancer and which genes can
    instead be able to suppress its expression. In this post, I will walk you through
    how I examined 9 different datasets about TCGA Liver, Cervical and Colon Cancer.
    All the datasets have been provided by the UCSC Xena (University of California,
    Santa Cruz website). For each of the 3 different types of cancer considered, three
    datasets were used, containing information about DNA methylation (Methylation450k),
    gene expression RNAseq (IlluminaHiSeq) and finally exon expression RNAseq (IlluminaHiSeq).
    These datasets are then grouped by information type rather than by cancer. I decided
    to use these datasets because they had all their features in common and shared
    a similar number of samples. Furthermore, I decided to select these types of cancers,
    because they offered a varied view of the genes and chromosomes characteristics
    of the human body since the different cancers were located in different parts
    of the body. In this way, the classification results obtained in this exercise
    could be generalised to other forms of cancer. DNA methylation plays an important
    role in the regulation of gene expression, and its modification can either result
    in generation or suppression of cancerous cells [3].

    final three datasets, the classification between the different types of cancers
    was performed. In order to produce these results, a 70% training, 30% test split
    ratio was used. As shown in Table 1, many classifications algorithms were considered.
    These results were obtained making use of the whole datasets and the classifiers
    aimed to correctly distinguish between the three different types of cancer.

    how the classification accuracy results would be affected by using just the first
    two principal components (Table 2). PCA aims to reduce the dimensionality of a
    dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. As can be noticed from
    Table 2, reducing the data dimensionality to just two features didn’t lead to
    a drastic decrease in accuracy.

    the two axes represent the two principal components created by PCA. The Exon expression
    dataset seemed to be the most affected by PCA, scoring at maximum 65% accuracy.
    The reason for this result is the major overlap between the different classes,
    this is shown in Figure 1(c).

- en: Finally, I decided to apply another feature extraction technique such as t-SNE.
    This technique can be implemented to visualise high-dimensional data into a lower
    dimensional space maximising the separation between the different classes. The
    results are shown in Figure 2, the two-axis represents the two main components
    engineered by t-SNE. Each of the three different types of cancer has been labelled
    using different colours (TCGA Liver = 0, Cervical = 1, Colon = 2). As can be seen,
    by Figure 2, t-SNE created two features able to separate well the three different
    classes.

    to achieve really good classification results. Using feature extraction techniques
    such as PCA and t-SNE, it has then been shown that it is possible to reduce dimensionality
    whilst still yielding an appreciable classification score. Thanks to these results,
    I then decided to plot a decision tree representing the main features (the ones
    holding the biggest weights) used in classification to take a closer look at most
    important ones. I decided to use a Decision Tree for analysis due to its classification
    performance in all three datasets. The results can be seen in Figure 3 (DNA methylation),
    Figure 4 (Gene Expression) and Figure 5 (Exon Expression).

    colour (TCGA Liver = 0, Cervical = 1, Colon = 2). The feature distributions of
    all three cancers are represented in the tree’s starting node. As long as we move
    down each branch the algorithm tries then to best separate the different distributions
    using the feature described underneath each of the node graphs. The circles generated
    alongside the distributions represent the number of elements correctly classified
    after following a certain node, the bigger the number of elements the bigger the
    size of the circle.

    by Terence Parr and Prince Grover. I decided to use this library since it enabled
    me to visualise the features distributions in each branch of the tree. This can
    be particularly important in a biological ambit when trying to analyse the differences
    between classes and in observing how an algorithm makes its classification decisions.

    of the three different trees. After careful research, looking into online available
    databases, a series of relevant annotations have been added for each of the features
    (Table 3). In the case of cg27427318 and chr10:81374338–81375201 it was not possible
    to find any relevant information.

    decided to use PCA and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the data to
    just two dimensions and perform Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    classification to see how much variance of the data had been covered. The results
    are available in Table 4, which shows that using just the most important features
    from the datasets led to excellent classification results (thanks to the reduced
    noise). In all the considered cases, between 83% and 99% of the original data
    variance was preserved.

    would be interesting to try alternative Feature Selection techniques such as Recursive
    Feature Selection (RFS) or SVM (as explained in this my other post) to see if
    other types of genes/chromosomes can be identified. Another possible improvement
    to this analysis could be to use datasets containing data from healthy subjects
    as well to cross-validate the obtained results.
