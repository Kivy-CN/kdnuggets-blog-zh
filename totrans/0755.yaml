    dataset. Nonetheless, numerous EDA strategies are effective at addressing several
    typical issues encountered within datasets.

    is where data is gathered from various sources for subsequent analysis.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In data analysis, handling tabular data is quite common. During the analysis
    of such data, it's often necessary to gain rapid insights into the data's patterns
    and distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    analysis and are known as summary statistics.

    through metrics such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range,
    percentiles, and quartiles.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before starting our exploration, data usually needs to be prepared for further
    analysis. Data preparation involves transforming, aggregating, or cleaning data
    using Python's pandas library to suit the needs of your analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This step is tailored to the data’s structure and can include grouping, appending,
    merging, sorting, categorizing, and dealing with duplicates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Python, accomplishing this task is facilitated by the pandas library through
    its various modules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The preparation process for tabular data doesn't adhere to a universal method;
    instead, it's shaped by the specific characteristics of our data, including its
    rows, columns, data types, and the values it contains.

    within the dataset easily comprehensible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the right charts can help us identify trends within a big dataset and
    find hidden patterns or outliers. Python offers different libraries for data visualization,
    including Matplotlib or Seaborn among others.

    of them provides insights into the distribution and correlations between the dataset''s
    variables. Techniques vary depending on the number of variables analyzed:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Univariate
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main focus in univariate analysis is on examining each variable within our
    dataset on its own. During this analysis, we can uncover insights such as the
    median, mode, maximum, range, and outliers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This type of analysis is applicable to both categorical and numerical variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bivariate
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bivariate analysis aims to reveal insights between two chosen variables and
    focuses on understanding the distribution and relationship between these two variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As we analyze two variables at the same time, this type of analysis can be
    trickier. It can encompass three different pairs of variables: numerical-numerical,
    numerical-categorical, and categorical-categorical.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Multivariate
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A frequent challenge with large datasets is the simultaneous analysis of multiple
    variables. Even though univariate and bivariate analysis methods offer valuable
    insights, this is usually not enough for analyzing datasets containing multiple
    variables (usually more than five).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This issue of managing high-dimensional data, usually referred to as the curse
    of dimensionality, is well-documented. Having a large number of variables can
    be advantageous as it allows the extraction of more insights. At the same time,
    this advantage can be against us due to the limited number of techniques available
    for analyzing or visualizing multiple variables concurrently.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This step focuses on the examination of data points collected over regular time
    intervals. Time series data applies to data that change over time. This basically
    means our dataset is composed of a group of data points that are recorded over
    regular time intervals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we analyze time series data, we can typically uncover patterns or trends
    that repeat over time and present a temporal seasonality. Key components of time
    series data include trends, seasonal variations, cyclical variations, and irregular
    variations or noise.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Outliers and missing values can skew analysis results if not properly addressed.
    This is why we should always consider a single phase to deal with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Identifying, removing, or replacing these data points is crucial for maintaining
    the integrity of the dataset's analysis. Therefore, it is highly important to
    address them before start analyzing our data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Outliers are data points that present a significant deviation from the rest.
    They usually present unusually high or low values.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Missing values are the absence of data points corresponding to a specific variable
    or observation.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A critical initial step in dealing with missing values and outliers is to understand
    why they are present in the dataset. This understanding often guides the selection
    of the most suitable method for addressing them. Additional factors to consider
    are the characteristics of the data and the specific analysis that will be conducted.
