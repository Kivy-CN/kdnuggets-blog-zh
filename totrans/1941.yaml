    of data each second. Affordable storage makes it possible to record seemingly
    arbitrary amounts of information. And machine learning algorithms, together with
    distributed computing, increasingly rise to the task of extracting actionable
    intelligence from this information. But what precisely does "big data" mean?

    with it. While many terms of art are well defined, others are buzzwords, ubiquitous
    in the media but lacking concrete meaning.

    namely the theorist, the empirical data scientist, and the press release bluster,
    which too often is parroted by the mainstream press.

    research, today''s big data is sufficiently large that it cannot fit conveniently
