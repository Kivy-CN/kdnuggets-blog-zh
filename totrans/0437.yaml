    world in the last few years, where it’s evident that we’ve become data-dependent,
    was the primary force behind the data science popularity.

- en: The highest pays are, also expected, in the Tech Industry. The data scientist
    salary here is virtually unchanged in the first three years of experience. But
    these starting points are significantly higher than in other industries. For every
    experience category, the pay in the Tech Industry is the highest. The only exception
    is 15+ years. Data show this is probably due to the tech companies' significantly
    lower need for the most experienced staff compared to the total number of their
    data science jobs. They have the highest demand for data scientists with 0-1 and
    1-3 years of experience.

    come second, third, and fourth. Interestingly enough, the drop in salaries for
    data science employees with 10-14 years of experience in all three industries
    show (and data backs this up) these are the professionals needed the least. Then
    the demand for the most experienced data scientists rises significantly, especially
    in Biotech & Pharmaceuticals and Media & Marketing. If you’re a data scientist
    executive, you’ll earn the most in these industries.

    Considering the pay rise, working in consulting is the most beneficial if you’re

    other industries.

    Compared to other companies, the best period to work in such companies is when
    you have up to three years or more than seven years of experience. If you’re in
