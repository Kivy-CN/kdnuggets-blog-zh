  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data cleaning is the first step in data preparation. It finds and fixes errors
    like missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent formats. Tasks include removing
    duplicates, filling gaps, and standardizing formats. The aim is to boost data
    quality and reliability. Clean data ensures better analysis and decision-making.
    For example, a retail company uses clean sales data to decide how much inventory
    to stock. This helps avoid having too much or too little of products on shelves.
