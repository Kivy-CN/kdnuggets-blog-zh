    every data source — structured or unstructured. The graph can help users answer
    any question quickly and interactively, allowing users to converse with the data

    new possibilities where graph is particularly well suited. The graph, based on
    open-standards is a platform for continuous improvement. Within the graph, sources
    are quickly linked and harmonized using business rules, text analytics and even **machine
    learning (this is going to be important soon).**

    the same concept. It reminded me of the time-space fabric. I went ahead and defined
    the Data Fabric (without knowing is that what the authors mean and without reading
    other definitions).

- en: The concept of the Space-Time Fabric in Physics is a construct created to explain
    the continuous of space and time, and it’s made of four (or eleven or twenty six
    depending on the theory you are) dimensions. Inside of this construct gravity
    is a manifestation of warping the fabric of space-time.

    space as a fabric, but if you do, be aware that what you’re doing is implicitly
    reducing your perspective down to a two-dimensional analogy. Space in our Universe
    is three dimensional, and when you combine it with time, you get a four dimensional
    quantity.'

    enhancing the in-memory graph in an iterative manner.
