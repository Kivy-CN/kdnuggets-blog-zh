    for it. However, at the highest executive level, the salaries vary much more as

    in their pay scale is also too high. An interesting observation is that freelancers
    earn more than part-timers but variation in their pay scales almost looks proportional.

    graph reveals more information. Senior levels job salaries on average coincide
    with Executive level salaries. Moreover, on average senior levels jobs salaries
    of small companies almost coincide with executive-level salaries of respective
    company size.

- en: By summing the salaries column we end up with very skewed data towards the USA.
    This might be because of various factors like most data scientist jobs being created
    in the USA, the data is mostly collected in the US, or the data collection form
    might be in English, and this form might have been circulated in non-English speaking
    countries. However, in order to linearize the data, we will take a log10 scale
    on the salaries column and these scaled values are passed for drawing the colors
    of the map.

- en: The sum of salaries might not be a correct measure for comparison as the entries
    in a particular country might be more than others. So we plot the mean keeping
    the log10 scale. This gives a much better idea of salaries across the world.

    States of America (US) and it also has the highest-paying jobs. Canada (CA), Japan
    (JP), Germany (DE), United Kingdom (GB), Spain (ES), France (FR), Greece (GR),
    and India (IN) follow in terms of highest job salaries and a number of jobs (except
    Japan) in that order respectively.

    in USD, followed by the Swiss franc and Singapore dollar. This graph is heavily
    influenced by the value of a particular currency as most currencies on the left-hand
