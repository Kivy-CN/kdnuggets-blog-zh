    became extremely popular. Search engines were swapped for sophisticated chatbots
    such as ChatGPT. With open-source alternatives such as [PaLM + RLHF](https://github.com/lucidrains/PaLM-rlhf-pytorch)
    on the horizon, AI and machine learning will become more accessible to neophyte
    developers. However, becoming a true machine learning engineer requires more skill
    than just scripting or coding. It’s currently one of the most in-demand tech jobs
    in the world.

    with humans in a natural way. This is particularly important as more and more
    applications that require interaction between humans and machines are developed.
    Without NLP, these interactions would be limited to simple commands or responses,
    which would significantly reduce their usefulness and potential impact.

    time and effort. Thus, you must approach learning and dividing your time pragmatically.
    Being able to do this is a skill in itself. Albeit, there are a few skills you
    should not waste too much time honing.

    in your skill set to become an effective ML engineer. This is untrue. There is
    very little mathematics involved in modern applied machine learning. However,
    it may still be a great skill to have. It can teach you how to approach problems
    methodically and logically. However, hard applied Math(s) is mostly unnecessary.

    Much of machine learning modeling [has been democratized](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2021/12/20/machine-learning-democratized-of-the-people-for-the-people-by-the-machine/).
    As such, many of the models you’ll need are available and automated. However,
    you must be able to identify the best model to use for a given problem. Ultimately,
    modeling is a solved problem and it’s one of the easiest parts of an ML engineer’s
    job.
