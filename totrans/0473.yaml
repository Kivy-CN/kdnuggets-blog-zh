    science](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/18-of-the-most-recommended-data-science-platforms-to-learn-python-and-sql/).
    Obviously, 18 is too many for a single person, and not all the platforms are relevant
    to you depending on your experience level and where you are in your journey.

    to data scientist into different stages based on experience and goals and recommend
    a few online resources to help you in the stage you're at in your career path
    to data scientist.

    about their journey, and collected a few recommendations for online resources
    that have helped them along with their careers. And then I matched that information
    with my data scientist career path and the resources I used to become a data scientist.

    my journey myself is that your career path as a data scientist can be broken up
    into four different stages. Going from a complete novice to [get a data science
    job](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-get-a-data-science-job-the-ultimate-guide/),
    these are the four stages:'

    all of the theory, and to test out the tools and platforms that you'd be using
    on the job. At this stage, everybody is a beginner. So, you may have come out
    of university, or you might still be in school, or you may have switched careers,
    but you might only have one or two coding classes underneath your belt, or you
    may not have any coding experience at all, but this stage is to get some exposure
    about platforms, code and data science type of problems.

    well to some extent before I had to switch to the next platform to take me up
    another level. But in the first stage, as you are getting exposure, any one of
    these platforms down in the above graph would help you gain exposure to coding
    and data science type of problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    courses offered from Coursera or Udemy to give you the exposure and to understand
    whether or not you are interested in data science.

    of specialized topics that allow me to leverage data science topics like developing
    a machine learning model and specialize or apply that to something more in a specific
    industry that I was interested in going to.

    actually means.

    in this data science community is to then learn from others like from YouTube,
    Reddit, and other discussion forums that might be available out there.

    feel like and what you might experience in the future.

    tutorial mode and getting into data science topics that are a lot more complicated
    and complex that you can eventually apply to your job. In addition to that, it's
    about going to discussion forums like Reddit or watching YouTube videos of other
    data scientists to understand what their experiences are like, as this will make
    you able to envision what a data science career might look like on your end.

    a little bit about what the career might look like as a data scientist, and you're

    to actually enter data science as a career and to finally get serious. Now, what
    you have to do is get out of these educational platforms like DataCamp and get
    into doing projects that will test your skills from end to end.
  prefs: []

    to do some of the projects and to rank yourselves against other data scientists.

    in-person data science Bootcamp, then General Assembly is a very popular one where
    they'll teach you how to get into data science.
  prefs: []

    you want to interview prep to become a data scientist. You definitely then should
    try one of these interview prep platforms like LeetCode or StrataScratch.

    real companies that can get you the practice that you need to be successful in
    the interviews.

    What you should do is refine your skills so that you can work on projects, you
    can make a meaningful impact, and you can answer and solve questions in a data
    science interview very quickly and without a lot of struggle. So, what you need
    is a lot of practice at some of these projects and interview questions.

    scientist before, getting out of stage three can be tough. So, what you need to
    do is take stage three seriously. Prep and study as much as possible so you know
    coding and answering these technical questions. It will make you able to apply
    those skills when you land your first job.

    creating data pipelines, you can do more like R&D type of analyses or whatever
    it is. In the beginning years, you're going to probably do them all, and then
    as you specialize and grow into your career, you might just do less and just be
    more specialized in certain roles.

- en: Now that we've gone over a typical data scientist career path, I do have to
    say that not all data science journeys are the same. This is essentially a collection
    of common stages and themes that I picked up when talking to a few data scientists
    in the community as well as reflections on my own journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm guessing that you are on stages one to three, and you're trying to figure
    out a way to land your first data science job. So, what I would recommend is,
    depending on what stage you're in, select a few online resources to help you in
    that stage and help you get to the next level. Stage four is really where we want
    to end up being professional data scientists.
