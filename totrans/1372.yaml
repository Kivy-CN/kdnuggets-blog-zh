    me think about cognitive biases in a way I never had before. I realized how deeply
    seated some cognitive biases are. In fact, we often don’t even consciously realize
    when our thinking is being affected by one. For data scientists, these biases
    can really change the way we work with data and make our day-to-day decisions,
    and generally not for the better.

    analysis, we have to make subjective decisions, though. So even though we work
    with hard facts and data, there’s a strong interpretive component to data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result, we data scientists need to be extremely careful, because all humans
    are very much susceptible to cognitive biases. We’re no exception. In fact, I
    have seen many instances where data scientists ended up making decisions based
    on pre-existing beliefs, limited data or just irrational preferences.

    for Naval Analyses were tasked with a problem. They needed to reinforce the military’s
    fighter planes at their weakest spots. To accomplish this, they turned to data.
    They examined every plane that came back from a combat mission and made a note
    of where bullets had hit the aircraft. Based on that information, they recommended
    that the planes be reinforced at those precise spots.

    and not at the planes that didn’t. Of course, data from the planes that had been
    shot down would almost certainly have been much more useful in determining where
    fatal damage to a plane was likely to have occurred, as those were the ones that
    suffered catastrophic damage.

    that we’re working with incomplete data.'

    begin working on a data set. You have created your features and reached a decent
    accuracy on your modelling task. But maybe you should ask yourself if that is
    the best result you can achieve. Have you tried looking for more data? Maybe adding
    weather forecast data to the regular sales variables that you use in your ARIMA
    models would help you to forecast your sales better. Or perhaps some features
    around holidays can tell your model why your buyers are behaving in a particular
    fashion around Thanksgiving or Christmas.

    in a rigorous, scientific way about the problem at hand and then brainstorming
    about any type of data that could help solve it (rather than just starting with
    the data). These approaches may seem similar, but the second method restricts
    your vision because you don’t know what’s missing from your work. By using the
    first approach, you will know what data you were not able to get, and you will
    end up factoring that into your conclusions.'

    that awful book because we were already halfway through. Everyone has been in
    a situation where they ended up wasting more time because they were trying to

    been incurred and cannot be recovered by any additional action. The sunk cost
    fallacy refers to the tendency of human beings to make decisions based on how
    much of an investment they have already made, which leads to even more investment
    but no returns whatsoever.

    than two years without results, but an investigator continues running it because
    so much time, money and effort have already been invested. Or a data scientist
    might defend her project wholeheartedly because she has invested so much in it,
    failing to realize that putting in more work won’t help her or the company in
    the long run and that it is best if the project is scrapped.

    cost information. Of course, it is never easy for us data scientists to just disregard
    data. For myself, I have found that a methodical way works best in this case.
    I take a pen and paper to get away from all the distractions and try to come up
    with all the additional costs required to do a project along with the benefits
    I might get in the future. If the cost part of the task seems overly significant,
    then it is time to move on.'

    that we can.
  prefs: []

    the simple maxim that correlation does not imply causation. Those five words are

    one causes the other.

    in New York City in the 1980s found a strong correlation between the number of
    serious crimes committed and the amount of ice cream sold by street vendors.But
    should we conclude that eating ice cream drives people to crime? Since this makes
    little sense, we should obviously suspect that there was an unobserved variable
    causing both. During the summer, crime rates are the highest, and this is also
    when most ice cream is sold. Ice cream sales don’t cause crime, nor does crime
    increase ice cream sales.

    it’s important to ask ourselves if our independent variable is possibly just correlated
