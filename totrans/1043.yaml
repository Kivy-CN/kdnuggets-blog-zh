- en: According to Jim Frost, Hypothesis Testing is a **form of inferential statistics
    that allows us to draw conclusions about an entire population based on a representative
    sample** [..] In most cases, it is simply impossible to observe the entire population
    to understand its properties. The only alternative is to collect a random sample
    and then use statistics to analyze it [1].

    An example of a hypothesis is “there is a correlation between height and gender
    in a population,” or “there is a difference between two groups of a population.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, the thesis to be demonstrated is called the **Alternative Hypothesis**
    (HA), and its opposite is the **Null Hypothesis** (H0). In practice, the Null
    Hypothesis states that there is nothing new happening in the population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In the previous examples, Null Hypotheses could be formulated as follows: there
    is no correlation between height and gender in the population, and there is not
    a difference between the two groups. The objective of Hypothesis Testing is to
    verify if the Null Hypothesis can be rejected or not. **In general, rejecting
    the Null Hypothesis does not automatically mean that the alternative hypothesis
    is accepted.** However, in some cases, rejecting the Null Hypothesis can imply
    that the Alternative Hypothesis can be accepted.'

    samples, while not paired samples are also called independent samples. In paired
    samples, natural or matched couplings occur.'
