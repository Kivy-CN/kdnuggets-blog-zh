    through what people are calling a [*digital transformation*](https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/what-is-digital-transformation/).
    That is, businesses are taking traditional business processes such as hiring,
    marketing, pricing, and strategy, and using digital technologies to make them
    10 times better.

    Science, organizations no longer have to make their important decisions based
    on hunches, best-guesses, or small surveys. Instead, they’re analyzing large amounts
    of real data to base their decisions on real, data-driven facts. That’s really
    what Data Science is all about — creating value through data.

    with an increase in interest by over four times in the past 5 years, according
    to [Google Search Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=Data%20Science).
    Data is giving companies a sharp advantage over their competitors. With more data
    and better Data Scientists to use it, companies can acquire information about
    the market that their competitors might not even know existed. It’s become a game
    of Data or perish.

    Storing data, cleaning data, visualizing and exploring data, and finally, modeling
    data to get some actual results. That manual work is just begging for automation
    and thus has been the rise of automated Data Science and [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

    want to move fast and innovate, but losing the trust of their customers over privacy
    or security issues can be fatal. So, they’re forced to make it a priority, at

    as the issues are magnified by enormous public hacks. Just recently, on November
    22, 2019, [an exposed server with no security was discovered on Google Cloud](https://siliconangle.com/2019/11/22/1-2b-account-records-stolen-latest-serious-data-hack/).
    The server contained the personal information of **1.2 Billion** **unique people** including
    names, email addresses, phone numbers, and LinkedIn and Facebook profile information.

    will find that they have a far easier time convincing customers to give them more
    data (by continuing to use their products and services). It also ensures that,
    should their government enact any laws *requiring* security protocols for customer
    data, they are already well-prepared. Many companies are opting for [SOC 2 Compliance](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/soc-2-compliance/) to

    has gone far past what a personal computer can handle. A decent PC might have
    something like 64GB of RAM with an 8 core CPU and 4TB of storage. That works just

    Cloud vendors such as [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) offer

    the easiest way to handle it and collect it in spreadsheets. If you needed to

    into numbers.

    Natural language and text contain so much rich data and information — we used

    of NLP into our regular Data Analysis. Neural Networks can now extract information
    from large bodies of text incredibly quickly. They’re able to classify text into
    different categories, determine sentiment about a text, and perform analysis on
    the similarity of text data. In the end, all of that information can be stored
    in a single feature vector of numbers.

    text, not just one-word answers but full-on paragraphs, can be transformed into
    numerical data for standard analysis. We’re now able to explore datasets that
    are far more complex.

    more views. Without advanced NLP, all one could go off of would be the keywords,
    or maybe just a hunch as to why a particular title worked well versus another.
    With today’s NLP, we’d be able to *quantify *the text on the website, comparing
    entire paragraphs of text or even webpages to gain much more comprehensive insights.
