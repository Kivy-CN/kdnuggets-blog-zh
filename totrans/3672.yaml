    processing ([NLP](https://saturncloud.io/glossary/natural-language-processing-nlp/))
    tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, summarization,
    question-answering, and content generation. Some well-known large language models
    include OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, with GPT-4 being
    one of the most famous, Google’s [BERT](https://saturncloud.io/glossary/bert/) (Bidirectional

- en: 'Pre-training on massive text corpora: Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained
    on enormous text datasets, which often encompass a significant portion of the
    internet. By learning from diverse sources, LLMs capture the structure, patterns,
    and relationships within language, enabling them to understand context and generate
    coherent text. This pre-training phase helps LLMs build a robust knowledge base
    that serves as a foundation for various natural language processing tasks.'

- en: 'Fine-tuning on task-specific labeled data: After pre-training, LLMs are fine-tuned
    using smaller, labeled datasets specific to particular tasks and domain, such
    as sentiment analysis, machine translation, or question answering. This fine-tuning
    process allows the models to adapt their general language understanding to the
    nuances of the target tasks, resulting in improved performance and accuracy.'

- en: Prompt based-learning differs from traditional LLM training approaches, such
    as those used for GPT-3 and BERT, which demand pre-training on unlabeled data
    and subsequent task-specific fine-tuning with labeled data. Prompt-based learning
    models, on the other hand, can adjust autonomously for various tasks by integrating
    domain knowledge through the use of prompts.

- en: The success of the output generated by a prompt-based model is heavily reliant
    on the prompt’s quality. An expertly formulated prompt can steer the model towards
    generating precise and pertinent outputs. Conversely, an inadequately designed
    prompt may yield illogical or unrelated outputs. The craft of devising efficient
    prompts is referred to as prompt engineering.

- en: 'Self-attention mechanism: The transformer architecture, which underpins many
    LLMs, introduces a self-attention mechanism that revolutionized the way language
    models process and generate text. Self-attention enables the models to weigh the
    importance of different words in a given context, allowing them to selectively
    focus on relevant information when generating text or making predictions. This
    mechanism is computationally efficient and provides a flexible way to model complex
    language patterns and long-range dependencies.'

- en: 'Positional encoding and embeddings: In the transformer architecture, input
    text is first converted into embeddings, which are continuous vector representations
    that capture the semantic meaning of words. Positional encoding is then added
    to these embeddings to provide information about the relative positions of words
    in a sentence. This combination of embeddings and positional encoding allows the
    transformer to process and generate text in a context-aware manner, enabling it
    to understand and produce coherent language.'

    units, called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters. Tokenization
    is an essential step in the pipeline of LLMs, as it allows the models to process
    and analyze text in a structured format. There are several tokenization methods
    and techniques used in LLMs:'

    each word as a separate token. While simple and intuitive, word-based tokenization
    can struggle with out-of-vocabulary words and may not efficiently handle languages
    with complex morphology.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Subword-based tokenization: Subword-based methods, such as Byte Pair Encoding
    (BPE) and WordPiece, split text into smaller units that can be combined to form
    whole words. This approach enables LLMs to handle out-of-vocabulary words and
    better capture the structure of different languages. BPE, for instance, merges
    the most frequently occurring character pairs to create subword units, while WordPiece
    employs a data-driven approach to segment words into subword tokens.'

- en: 'Character-based tokenization: This method treats individual characters as tokens.
    Although it can handle any input text, character-based tokenization often requires
    larger models and more computational resources, as it needs to process longer
    sequences of tokens.'
