    Familiarity with Python as a language is assumed; if you need a quick introduction
    to the language itself, see the free companion project, [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython):
    it''s a fast-paced introduction to the Python language aimed at researchers and

    in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code instead
    of math, and discrete approximations instead of continuous mathematics. As a result,
    what would be an integral in a math book becomes a summation, and most operations
    on probability distributions are simple loops.

- en: This is a work in progress, which I add to as time allows. The purpose behind
    it is to have a balance between theory and implementation for the software engineer
    to implement machine learning models comfortably without relying too much on libraries.
    Most of the time the concept behind a model or a technique is simple or intutive
    but it gets lost in details or jargon. Also, most of the time existing libraries
    would solve the problem at hand but they are treated as black boxes and more often
    than not they have their own abstractions and architectures that hide the underlying
    concepts. This book's attempt is to make the underlying concepts clear.

    statistical inference. The intended audience are students who are numerically
    and computationally literate, who would like to put those skills to use in Data
    Science or Statistics. The book is offered for free as a series of markdown documents
    on github and in more convenient forms (epub, mobi) on LeanPub and retail outlets.

- en: This book is about convex optimization, a special class of mathematical optimization
    problems, which includes least-squares and linear programming problems. It is
    well known that least-squares and linear programming problems have a fairly complete
    theory, arise in a variety of applications, and can be solved numerically very
    efficiently. The basic point of this book is that the same can be said for the
    larger class of convex optimization problems.

    a language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages like English,
    Hindi or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as programming languages
    and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from generation
    to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take Natural
    Language Processing — or NLP for short — in a wide sense to cover any kind of
    computer manipulation of natural language.

    interact and industries conduct business. Individuals produce data at an unprecedented
    rate by interacting, sharing, and consuming content through social media. Understanding
    and processing this new type of data to glean actionable patterns presents challenges
    and opportunities for interdisciplinary research, novel algorithms, and tool development.
    Social Media Mining integrates social media, social network analysis, and data
    mining to provide a convenient and coherent platform for students, practitioners,
    researchers, and project managers to understand the basics and potentials of social
    media mining.
