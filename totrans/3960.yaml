- en: As programmers, we often rely on various external libraries to solve different
    problems. These libraries are created by skillful developers and provide solutions
    that save us time and effort. But have you ever thought, *“Can I create my custom
    libraries too?”* The answer is yes! This article explains the necessary steps
    to help you accomplish that, whether you are a professional developer or just
    starting out. From writing and structuring your code to documentation and publishing,
    this guide covers it all.

    primary indicator to Python that the directory it resides in is a package. It
    consists of initialization code if any and executes automatically when a package
    or any of its modules are imported.

    `\multiples`. The choice is yours; however, I like to keep it at the top level
    within the root directory as I think it is a better way to modularize your code.
