- en: I didn't use Facebook for almost seven years, and now the Facebook groups have
    evolved into proper communities where people learn and grow together. I think
    the platform has so much to offer in terms of helping beginners start a career
    in data science or an expert keeping track of new trends.

- en: You will find top-quality educational and professional content as they are heavily
    moderated by admins. Apart from that, It is hard to become a full member. Some
    groups will let you in, but admins will restrict your access to posting the content
    until they feel you are a valuable community member.

    all of them. Most of the time, the content is not related to what you are looking
    for. You feel overwhelmed and end up wasting 20 minutes on constant scrolling.
    The Facebook groups are pretty much clean, even If you see the advertisement,
    it will be related to data science.'

- en: The list below contains the top 18 groups based on the number of members. Some
    of the groups are hard to get in. It can take up to a month before group administrators
    let you in. All the groups I have mentioned are highly moderated, so you won't
    see **spam posts, self-promotions, advertisements,** or **off-topic discussions**.

- en: If you are using Facebook groups for promoting your content, the group admin
    will ban you, and if you keep posting on other groups to promote the same content,
    Facebook will block you from posting. These restrictions make these groups the
    perfect place to learn new concepts on machine learning, deep learning, data analytics,
    big data, business intelligence, and SQL. The only thing you have to do is to
    join the ever-growing groups of data science professionals and enthusiasts.
