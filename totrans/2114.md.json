The protons and neutrons have a positive charge, while the electrons have a negative charge, resulting in an overall neutral atom. The number of each particle determines the atomic number and the type of atom.\n---\nInstruction: How can we reduce air pollution?\nOutput: There are a number of ways to reduce air pollution, such as shifting to renewable energy sources, encouraging the use of public transportation, prohibiting the burning of fossil fuels, implementing policies to reduce emissions from industrial sources, and implementing vehicle emissions standards. Additionally, individuals can do their part to reduce air pollution by reducing car use, avoiding burning materials such as wood, and changing to energy efficient appliances.\n---\nInstruction: Describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision.\nOutput: I had to make a difficult decision when I was working as a project manager at a construction company. I was in charge of a project that needed to be completed by a certain date in order to meet the client's expectations. However, due to unexpected delays, we were not able to meet the deadline and so I had to make a difficult decision. I decided to extend the deadline, but I had to stretch the team's resources even further and increase the budget. Although it was a risky decision, I ultimately decided to go ahead with it to ensure that the project was completed on time and that the client's expectations were met. The project was eventually successfully completed and this was seen as a testament to my leadership and decision-making abilities.\n```", "```py\n# Function to provide an instruction\ndef ask(model, tokenizer, question, max_length=128):\n   inputs = tokenizer.encode(question, return_tensors='pt')\n   outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1)\n   answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n   return answer\n```", "```py\nquestion = \"Describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision.\"\nanswer = ask(model, tokenizer, question)\nprint(answer)\n```", "```py\nDescribe a time when you had to make a difficult decision.\n\nWhat did you do?
