    Yet, some skills are required to be successful in data science. All those key
    skills can be acquired by anyone with proper training and practice. In this article,
    I am going to share some of the important skills, Why they are considered important
    for a data scientist. Also, How those skills can be acquired.

- en: Data Scientists should develop the habit of critical thinking. It helps in better
    understanding the problem. Unless the problems are understood to the most granular
    level the solution can’t be good. Critical thinking helps in analyzing the different
    options and helps in choosing the right one.

- en: While solving data science problems it is not always a good or bad decision.
    A lot of options lie in the grey area between good and bad. There are so many
    decisions involved in a data science project. Like, choosing the right set of
    attributes, the right methodology, the right algorithms, the right metrics to
    measure the model performance, and so on. It requires more analysis and clear
    thinking to choose the right options.

    as many questions as possible until there are no more questions. The more we ask
    the more we understand. The better we understand the problem, the better the outcome.

    scenario at a telecom company. We want to identify loyal and high-net-worth customers.
    To identify this customer segment, we would have to start with a series of questions
    like,

    Let’s consider a scenario where the data science team is working with the customer
    growth team. The objective is to understand the reason for customer churn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of new customers without establishing the worthiness or intent of the customer'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Customer Support Team** — There have been many payment-related issues reported
    by many customers. It could be the reason for the customer churn'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have not spoken to the other teams you would have started to work on
    the problem just based on the inputs provided by the growth team. You can’t solve
    a problem by just relying on inputs from just one team. Even if the growth team
    is the primary sponsor here it is not sufficient to just rely on the inputs provided
    by them. To get a holistic picture you need to talk to a different set of stakeholders.
    When you limit the people or the teams with whom you are working with then the
    bias from those will pass on to the solution you are building.
  prefs: []

    engineering and the other technology teams. Without a good collaborative effort,
    there won’t be success.

    The problems and the solutions involved in data science are generally much more
    complex. It is very important to simplify them before communicating them to the
    business. The use of the story-telling approach in communicating helps a lot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me take an example and explain the importance of good communication more
    simple. Let us consider the following scenario. The data science team is working
    on a forecasting model to predict the energy usage for retail energy customers.
    The data science team needs to convince the business and the infrastructure team
    about the importance of having and running at least 10 different models for better
    accuracy. This means higher use of computational power and a lot more time for
    training the models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Option A **— You take about the clustering technique used to group the customer
    into different groups and hence you say there needs to be a model for each of
    those groups.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem here is the business team has not been conveyed about the benefit
    of actually having one model for each of the groups. So they might not be convinced
    if the cost turns out to be high.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Option B **— You start with the profile and the characteristics of the customers.
    You show the energy usage patterns of the customers. You show the business team
    the distinctive patterns like some households almost use negligible power during
    the weekend maybe because they generally tend to spend the weekend at a different
    place. Similarly, you show the distinctive patterns and hence you explain one
    model will not fit all these different customers, and hence there need to be at
    least 10 different models each to cater to the 10 different unique categories
    of customers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, the business understands the importance of having so many different models.
    They can easily compare the incremental benefit with the required infrastructure
    cost to evaluate the options.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is the job of the data science team to clearly communicate the idea to the
    stakeholders. It is not an easy job as most people have limited knowledge about
    data science. A data science project is considered successful only when the business
    finds value from it.
  prefs: []

    an environment where there is a good flow of information between the teams.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last but not least is leadership skills. Most organizations have a small data
    science team and they generally work on different sets of problems. It is very
    common for a data scientist to get pulled into different meetings and for Adhoc
    questioning. It is the job of the data scientist to decide when to say yes and
    when to say No. It is very important to set the priorities right.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    ability to envision the outcome. Many times there will be a lot of pressure from
    the business teams to rush up the analysis. It is the role of the data scientist
    to manage the expectations and produce an outcome of high quality.
