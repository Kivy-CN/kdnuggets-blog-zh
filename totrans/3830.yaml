    to solve big business problems. This isn’t changing. Advancements in artificial
    intelligence and machine learning have made robust [data science and business

    involves contracting a software development firm or hiring experienced software
    developers to build the required business applications. Unfortunately, this isn’t

    with virtually no coding experience. However, have they subverted the need for

    platforms that enable users to design and build applications. It often requires
    very little or no coding. Thus, they can be very useful for professionals with
    very little coding experience such as business analysts, office administrators,

    low-code software development approaches to reduce development overhead and accelerate
    the pace of innovation. Low code and no-code platforms will automatically generate
    all the required code in the background while supplying users with a graphical
    interface to help them design their applications.

    software developers were still required to write the more complicated elements

    it will require software developers to retool and rethink their positions within
    tech. This process will involve incorporating off-the-shelf solutions to support
    the non-unique aspects of application development.

    or idea for an application, the future developer’s focus will be on trying to
    connect tools, solutions, and endpoints. Of course, there will always be new code
    that is part of your intellectual property but we must revise the steps required
    to get there.

    APIs and libraries to help extend the functionality of applications. For instance,
    if you need your application to retrieve the current local time, you may opt to
    use a web service such as [WorldTimeAPI](http://worldtimeapi.org).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    websites](https://visualping.io), you’ll need access to an API that can facilitate
    this function. While many low-code tools supply suggestions or easy API integration,
    there are limitations. APIs often need to be configured which requires experience
    and expertise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, your low-code platform simply may not have the most optimal solution
    for your requirements. Thus, if developers can’t find an external solution that
    aligns with the use case requirements of the application, developers must sometimes
    write an API or plug-in of their own.

    low/no-code require configuration and substantial amounts of data. This will require
    experts to find and manage the correct data feeds and sources.

    the use of computer data storage. Essentially, you’ll need to dictate how the
    application will store its states. Which could mean configuring the application
    to store its data on a file or a database (or a combination of the two). This
    gets trickier if you’re storing the application's persistence and general data
    online or on cloud storage.

    application requirements change or as your business grows. If you’ve previously
    built a database, you may want to plug your new low-code created application into
    it. In most cases, all these conditions will require someone technically adept.

    main focus in the future. This will still require a collaborative effort between

    You’ll need backend developers to build and connect the backend logic. Low-code
    development platforms purport to provide you with all-in-one solutions that incorporate
    all these elements. Unfortunately, they often result in some very janky results
    that cannot compare to software built by an experienced software firm. This may
    change in the future, but for now, low-code platforms are best for automation
    and nitty-gritty solutions.

    time and of course, so will your business software requirements. Trying to get

    Firstly, many low-code development environments do not give you access to the
    generated code. This leaves you with very little visibility.

    the low code platform itself. In most instances, you don’t know how securely it’s
    accessing important assets and there aren’t a lot of ways you can change this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    code platforms can be quite inflexible. In many cases, you must use the encryption
    the low code solution provides you with. If bad actors can crack the type of encryption
    your low code platform uses to create the security elements for apps, this puts
    every individual and company at risk.

    you with more control. They can implement the latest cyber security standards
    and practices as they build your software. Most organizations require dynamic
    made-to-measure solutions for security. Fully customized software development
    ensures more control and more robust testing. You have full visibility into all

    a threat to the professional software developer’s job security. Of course, as
    low-code tools become more sophisticated, this may change in the future.  However,
    even then they will not eliminate the need for software developers. They will
    only force the job requirements to change and evolve as all innovation does. However,
    at least for now, low code tools can be supplementary to the customized software
    development experience but they aren’t ready to completely supersede it.
