    and its future. Some believed that it was just another fad that was going to die
    out soon. Whilst some believed there was a huge potential to implement it into
    our everyday lives.

    systems such as [Baby AGI](/2023/04/baby-agi-birth-fully-autonomous-ai.html) -
    we can stand on the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence in the future.
    It is nothing new. It's the same drastic change we saw with the arrival of computers,
    the internet, and smartphones.

    conducted with 6,000 customers in six countries, where only 36% of consumers were
    comfortable with businesses using AI and 72% expressed that they had some fear
    about the use of AI.

    more to come in the future regarding AI, the big question is ‘What are the ethics
    around it?’.

- en: The most developing and implemented area of AI development is machine learning.
    This allows models to learn and improve using past experience by exploring data
    and identifying patterns with little human intervention. Machine learning is used
    in different sectors, from finance to healthcare. We have virtual assistants such
    as Alexa, and now we have large language models such as ChatGPT.

- en: Although data is the new oil and we have a lot of it, there are still concerns
    about AI being biased and discriminative with the data it has. For example, the
    use of facial recognition applications has proven to be highly biased and discriminative
    to certain ethnic groups, such as people with darker skin tones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although some of these facial recognition applications had high racial and gender
    bias, companies such as Amazon refused to stop selling the product to the government
    in 2018.

    require a vast amount of data to produce accurate outputs and have high performance.
    However, there are concerns regarding data collection, storage, and use.

- en: Although AI applications are inputted with data, there is a high concern about
    the transparency of how these AI applications come to their decision. The creators
    of these AI applications deal with a lack of transparency raising the question
    of who to hold accountable for the outcome.

- en: We have seen the birth of Baby AGI, an autonomous task manager. Autonomous applications
    have the ability to make decisions with the help of a human. This naturally opens
    eyes to the public on leaving the decision to be made by technology, which could
    be deemed ethically or morally wrong in society's eyes.

    intelligence. With more and more people seeing that technology can do their job,
    such as ChatGPT creating content and potentially replacing content creators -
    what are the social and economic consequences of implementing AI into our everyday
    lives?

    of the use of AI](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/). The act aimed to ensure
    that AI systems met fundamental rights and provided users and society with trust.
    It contained a framework that grouped AI systems into 4 risk areas; unacceptable
    risk, high risk, limited, and minimal or no risk. You can learn more about it
    here: [European AI Act: The Simplified Breakdown](/2022/06/european-ai-act-simplified-breakdown.html).'

    framework around the use of AI. Therefore, we can see that countries and continents
    around the world are looking further into the use of AI and how it can be ethically
    used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fast advancements in AI will have to align with the proposed frameworks
    and standards. Companies who are building or implementing AI systems will have
    to follow ethical standards and conduct an assessment of the application to ensure
    transparency, and privacy and account for bias and discrimination.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These frameworks and standards will need to focus on data governance, documented,
    transparent, human oversight, and robust, accurate, cyber-safe AI systems. If
    companies fail to comply, they will, unfortunately, have to deal with fines and
    penalties.

    ethics surrounding it. For example, [Assessing the Transatlantic Race to Govern
    AI-Driven Decision-Making through a Comparative Lens](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4337517).
    We will continue to see more and more papers getting released till governments
    conduct and publish a clear and concise framework for companies to implement.
