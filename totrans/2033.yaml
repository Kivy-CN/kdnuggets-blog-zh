- en: There’s a quiet revolution happening in the world of data. For years we have
    been blasted with nonstop articles about “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”
    — a data scientist. A data scientist, we have been taught, is a figure of almost
    otherworldly intelligence who uses quasi-mystical arts to perform feats of data
    wizardly. But these days, if you talk to the people who watch the data space most
    closely — there’s a different data role that has them even more excited.
  prefs: []

- en: To be clear, there are some very real and very cool applications of data science
    that can allow organizations to do things with data that can completely transform
    how their organization operates. But for many orgs, particularly smaller organizations
    without millions of dollars to invest, data science initiatives tend to fall flat
    because of the lack of a solid data infrastructure to support them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While everyone was focused on the rise of data science, another discipline has
    been quietly taking shape, driven not by glitzy articles in Harvard Business Review
    but by the people working in the trenches in data-intensive roles. They call it
    the [analytics engineer](https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An analytics engineer is someone who brings together the data-savvy and domain
    knowledge of an analyst with software engineering tooling and best practices.
    Day to day, that means spending in a suite of tools that is becoming known as
    “[The Modern Data Stack](https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/)”
    and particularly dbt. These tools allow analytics engineers to centralize data
    and then model it for analysis in a way that is *remarkably* cheap and easy compared
    to how the ETL of traditional Business Intelligence teams of the past operated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While data scientists are seen by some as wizardry, the attitude of the analytics
    engineer is a little different. You’ll hear them refer to themselves as everything
    from “humble data plumbers’’ to “[just a pissed off data analyst](https://www.hashpath.com/2020/12/an-analytics-engineer-is-really-just-a-pissed-off-data-analyst/#:~:text=Often%20times%2C%20an%20analytics%20engineer,necessity%20(and%20genius%20branding).).”
    The work of an Analytics Engineer seems easy to understand, almost banal. They
    combine data sources, apply logic, make sure there are clean and well-modeled
    materializations to analyze.

    worked in, well, basically any organization knows that a tremendous amount of
    effort goes into standardizing data points that feel like they should be a no-brainer
    to pull, while more complex questions just sit unanswered for years. Analytics
    Engineering allows you to have data systems that *just work.*

    engineer being able to help build a truly data-driven culture in ways that would
    be challenging for a team of people using legacy tools. While in the past there
    was tremendous repetitive work to do any simple analysis, Analytics Engineers
    can build complex data models using tools like dbt and have analysis-ready data
    tables built on any schedule. While before it was impossible to get anyone to
    agree on standard definitions of metrics, Analytics Engineers can simply build
    them into their codebase. And in the past, people struggled with incomplete and
    messy data, and Analytics Engineers… still struggle with incomplete and messy
    data. But at least we can have a suite of tests on our analytics systems to know
    when something has gone wrong!

    — if one analytics engineer is substantially more impactful than a data analyst,
    won’t our jobs be at risk? Could an org replace five data analysts with one Analytics
    Engineer and come out ahead?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the fact of the matter is that no data analyst, anywhere, has ever come
    close to performing all of the analysis they think could be impactful at their
    organization — the opposite is far more likely to be the problem. Most data orgs
    are begging for additional headcount.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As analytics engineers increase the amount of insight organizations can find
    from data, it actually becomes *more* likely that these orgs will want to hire
    additional data talent (both analytics engineers and analysts). In his fantastic
    post [The Reorganization of the Factory](https://erikbern.com/2020/12/16/giving-more-tools-to-software-engineers-the-reorganization-of-the-factory.html),
    Erik Bernhardsson makes the case that as the toolsets for software engineers has
    become ever more efficient, the demand for software engineers has counterintuitively *grown *—
    as there are more and more use cases where it now makes sense to build software
    rather than a manual process. This point not only holds for data, but I think
    it actually is *more true *for data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While every organization needs software, not every organization needs *software
    engineers.* But every organization needs to learn from their data**,** **and**since
    the ways in which the data needs to be understood will be unique at every organization, *they
    will all need analytics engineers.* Software is commonly said to be eating the
    world — analytics engineering will be embedded in the world. As the incremental
    value of each data hire rises, there are substantial new areas where data insights
    and learnings could be applied that they aren’t today. And even if you aren’t
    interested in *becoming* an analytics engineer, having well modeled and accurate
    data makes data analysts and data scientists more effective. It’s a win across
    the board.

    doing good for the world. Having more powerful data operations allows you to question,
    seek insights, and look for new strategies. It can also allow an organization
    new ways to monitor their employees, surveil, or discriminate. One needs only
    look at the myriad of public issues in the tech and data science industries right
    now to see the ways that powerful tech can be misused. It is important to recognize
    the potential dangers as well as the new opportunities.

    — it’s because we are. What was very recently the domain of a few adventurous
    data teams is quickly becoming industry standard for tech organizations — and
    there’s every reason to think that other types of organizations will be following
    along shortly. The impact is just too high.

    you can find employment as an analytics engineer. The coming boom in opportunities
    for analytics engineers will take place across three rough domains, with each
    having different challenges and opportunities.

    to adapt to the modern data stack. As analytics engineering is brought into the
    most complex legacy data systems, we’ll begin to see what patterns develop to
    support analytics engineering at scale. If you are interested in really figuring
    out what the large-scale data systems of the future look like, this will be the
    place to go.

    to lead their data initiatives. This will give them a step up against any competition
    that isn’t investing in their core data. Being an early analytics engineer at
    a fast-growing company is tremendously fun and exciting, as you are able to build
    up a data organization from scratch and see firsthand how analytics engineering
    can change the trajectory of an organization.

    seeing the impact that analytics engineering can bring. You might not have quite
    the same tech budget, and you might have to learn to advocate for yourself a little
    more but it might be the area where analytics engineering has the most potential
    to do good for the world. City governments will use analytics engineering to monitor
    programs and ensure that government resources are being used effectively. Academic
    institutions will use analytics engineering to create datasets, many of them public,
    that will aid in scientific and technological development. The possibility space
    is wide open.

    of the world around us. It’s about allowing everyone in an organization to see
    a little bit further in their impact on the org and how their work connects to
    it. Right now, analytics engineering is still a new discipline — pretty soon,
    it will be everywhere.
