    is usually “machine learning.”

    first exposed to the idea of “machine learning,” which sounded really cool. So
    when I was looking for a place to start learning about data science, you can guess
    where I started (hint: it rhymes with *bean churning*).'

    learning is (a part of) data science, but data science isn’t necessarily machine
    learning, similar to how a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn’t necessarily
    a square.

    of a data scientist's job, where most of one’s time is spent elsewhere, which
    I’ll elaborate on later.

    In the same way that you first learn about English grammar, figurative language,
    and so forth, to write a good essay, you have to have these building blocks set
    in stone before you can learn machine learning.

    learning more advanced topics easier. Two, by learning the fundamentals, you will
    already have learned several machine learning concepts.

- en: Many data scientists struggle with this, even myself. Similar to my initial
    point, most data scientists think that “data science” and “machine learning” go
    hand in hand. And so, when faced with a problem, the very first solution that
    they consider is a machine learning model.
  prefs: []

    solve the problem at hand.
  prefs: []

    You may be required to clean and manipulate data using scripts, build data pipelines,
    or create interactive dashboards, all of which do not require machine learning.

    fundamentals. And I still stand by this.

    is the most important. And if you dread statistics, data science probably isn’t
    for you. I’d check out Georgia Tech’s course called [Statistical Methods](https://mediaspace.gatech.edu/playlist/dedicated/74258101/1_g5xwvbde/1_iw8fk73m) or [Khan
    Academy’s video series](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability).'

    I’ve personally never worked with R, so I have no opinion on it. The better you
    are at Python and SQL, the easier your life will be when it comes to data collection,
    manipulation, and implementation. I would also be familiar with Python libraries
    like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I also recommend that you learn about binary
    trees, as it serves as the basis for many advanced machine learning algorithms
    like XGBoost.'

    is that machine learning should not be the focus of your studies because it’s
    not a great use of time and will do little in helping you be a successful data
    scientist in the working world.
