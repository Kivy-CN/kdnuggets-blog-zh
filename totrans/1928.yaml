    paradoxes, ironies and disconnects in today’s world of data science: pain points,
    things ignored, shoved under the rug, denied or paid lip service to as the data
    science juggernaut continues to roll out across the digital space. For instance,
    and despite Hal Varian’s widely quoted observation that “the sexiest job in the
    next 10 years will be statisticians,” the advent of easy-to-use, point-and-click
    statistical software and analytic tools has meant that literally anyone can push
    buttons and get an answer. It matters little whether or not this is like handing
    a loaded bazooka to a gorilla and telling it to go out and have a good time. The
    unspoken reality is that statistical analysis has been relegated to the status
    of a commoditized skill of secondary importance to the much more urgently needed
    tasks requiring real skills associated with managing the architecture of the digital
    fire hose. A corollary to this is the simplifying assumption that anyone with
    a computer science background has the requisite statistical and analytical skills,
    whether they actually do or not.'

    civilization is on the cusp of a digital, networked transformation as momentous
    as the printing of the Gutenberg Bible. It took several centuries for the effects
    of that innovation to cascade through religion and culture as mass-produced Bibles
    disseminated throughout Europe, minimizing the need for the clergy and authority
    of the Catholic Church to mediate the relationship with God, coalescing in the
    Protestant Reformation in Luther’s understanding that the printed Bible made each
    man a theologian.

    revolution several centuries to play out. Hundreds of thousands of voices have
    sprung up on blogs or PLOS One, publishing millions of articles and books annually
    that collectively channel a tsunami of hope, hype and smoke and mirrors. Snake
    oil vendors and PT Barnums of big data and data science are proliferating along
    with a paralyzing surfeit of knowledge, and no clear line of sight through the
    chaos. In many ways ignorance has become the ironic arbiter of our time – we can
    praise folly but no one wants to pay for it.

    proxy is the outsized market valuations given by Wall St to entities such as Google,
    Apple, Amazon and FB vs the huge agency and media holding companies: WPP, Publicis,
    Omnicom and Interpublic – Yahoo could be included in this group as well. Realistic
    or not, the cumulated market caps of the tech players have multipliers in the
    neighborhood of 20 times the valuations of their big media counterparts (as of
    Friday, August 14, 2015). While these disparities may seem painfully obvious,
    the reasons behind them are not.'

    who shut down, eyes glazed, when confronted with even modestly challenging presentations,
    demanding the information be dumbed down to the level of pablum for instantaneous
    comprehension and digestion. On the other hand, these same individuals are totally
    comfortable paying fluent lip service to the digital era, oblivious to the discontinuity,
    taking comfort in the fact that any offending, too tech-literate subordinates
    will be forced out of their organizations for “lack of fit.”'

    in favor of the “common sense” ways of doing things and making money: the way
    it’s always been done. They’ve built their business models around maintenance
    of the status quo: just consider the evidence from the battle over the IP rights
    to music that began with Napster and continue to this day. The irony and paradox
    in all of this is that few are willing to identify themselves as old school or
    traditionalist, even if they are. It’s like the behavioral economic research showing
    that 80% of people think they are above average. Everyone today is a self-proclaimed,
    forward thinking innovator jumping on the bandwagon of the latest “big thing”
    to participate in all of the excitement, breathless buzz and hoopla of the times,
    making it extremely difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.'

    potential for and investment in predictive analytics, algorithmic learning and
    artificial intelligence – those highly technical, least understood areas with
    the most significant prospective potential. There is an unacknowledged bifurcation
    out there in the tension between the demand for data scientists possessing so-called
    intuitive, creative insights along with the ability to make complex ideas “intelligible”
    vs those driving unintuitive, black box, algorithmic answers.

    innovations, the fodder from 20th century science fiction seeing the light of
    day in the form of driverless cars, virtual reality, wearable tech, research labs
    on a chip, etc. The media entities, on the other hand, remain hesitant and risk
    averse, so far downstream in this cascade of innovations that the word almost
    loses its meaning. They prefer things that are “comprehensible” and that have
    been widely consecrated, generating little controversy, e.g. in health care, using
    CMS approved methods such as Medicare’s CDPS for chronic illness cost analysis
    and containment vs, for instance, leveraging an emerging body of academic work
    focused on fast and efficient, machine learning approaches to dynamic diagnosis
    and treatment. After all, the CDPS way is “validated” while the other has little
    or no ground truth and is just “making things up” (that’s a quote from the front
    lines of the data science divide).

- en: Another huge disconnect in all of this is the so-called war for talent, the
    myth that firms are competing for a dearth of skilled resources. One significant
    aspect of this “dearth” of talent is the stunningly unrealistic, almost delusional,
    nature of all too many data science job descriptions. If HR costs are the single
    biggest line item on a firm’s P&L, in a misguided attempt at minimizing those
    costs, firms seek candidates resembling nobody so much as Steve Jobs — even for
    junior positions — enabling them to condense into a single person a dizzying array
    of skills from computer science, IT and hands-on analysis to repping the company
    at industry conferences, driving innovation, strategic planning, team leadership,
    product development and client management. Finding a resource in possession of
    the intersection of all of these skills is no easy matter but deep pocketed companies
    are willing to wait, boiling the ocean until the perfect hire – the proverbial
    purple squirrel — comes along.

- en: That said, the reality is that there is a deluge of talent – take 2 seconds
    and go on Google Trends to witness the exponential growth in just the last few
    years in use of the keywords “data scientist” for compelling evidence of this.
    This means that the competition isn’t for talent per se, it’s for good, creative,
    cheap talent – people willing to step up and work for subsistence level wages.
    The emphasis is on “cheap” here as the salary scales among many startups – the
    willingness to pay even for highly skilled, senior data science resources – are
    not only at subsistence levels, they are so low as to be not so subtle expressions
    of contempt for the profession. Ever since Y2K, the move to leverage off shore
    resources is another expression of this institutionalized contempt disguised as
    cost-savings.

    science compensation to an incredibly low baseline: why pay more for North American
    talent when you can get the “same thing” at an enormous discount from the sub-continent?
    These are remorseless, MBA-driven, financial decisions that, like most cost-cutting
    initiatives, impact univariate dimensions of a firm’s balance sheet. Other less
    easily quantified metrics such as the quality of the work delivered, innovations
    developed or answers obtained may be hobbled in the process, but being less readily
    quantified, they become, therefore, unimportant.'

- en: One way to understand this is as a false dichotomy and legacy from the manufacturing
    industries dividing services into de facto white vs blue collar skillsets and
    remuneration corresponding to the side of the divide which you fall into (gender
    is another implicit divisor in this accounting). Since everyone uses a computer
    of some kind, the division is defined both by the platform (e.g., mobile or tablet
    vs fixed workstations) as well as the software used on an everyday basis. Anyone
    who writes code is, by definition, a blue collar drone – a programmer — possessing
    second- or third-class, commoditized status in the organization, someone who is
    simply painting by numbers to the brilliantly creative, tactical outline developed
    by white collar thinkers and strategists– and compensated accordingly.
