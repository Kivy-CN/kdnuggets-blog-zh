- en: Recently, I came across a wonderful article by Peter Norvig — “Teach yourself
    programming in 10 years”.
  prefs: []

- en: This is a witty and a tad bit satirical headline, taking a dig at all those
    coffee table programming books that aim to teach you programming in 24 hours,
    7 days, 10, days, ***insert a ridiculously short time line***.

    nature, and style of a programming language in 24 hours, but that doesn’t mean
    you’ve become adept at the art of programming. Because programming isn’t about
    a language at all. Programming is about intelligent design, a rigorous analysis
    of time and space complexity, understanding when a certain language works over
    another, and so much more.

    to find the area of a circle in 24 hours, but that’s not the point. Do you grasp [object
    oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) as
    a paradigm? Do you understand the use cases of [namespaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-IN/library/5cb46ksf.aspx) and [templates](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/templates/)?
    Do you know your way around the famed [STL](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/)?
    If you do, you certainly didn’t learn all this in a week, or even a month. It
    took you a considerable amount of time. And the more you learned, the more you
    realised that the abyss is deeper than it looks from the cliff.

    Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence as a whole. Feeding the hype,
    thousands of blogs, articles, and courses have popped up everywhere. Thousands
    of them have the same kind of headlines — “Machine Learning in 7 lines of code”,
    “Machine Learning in 10 days”, etc. This has, in turn led people on Quora to ask
    questions like [“How do I learn Machine Learning in 30 days?”](https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-plan-my-day-to-learn-machine-learning-in-30-days).
    The short answer is, “You can’t. No one can. And no expert (or even one comfortable
    with its ins and outs) did.”

    a second, you can’t do machine learning in 7 lines of code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why? Because those 7 lines of code do not explain how you did in the [bias-variance
    tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff), what
    your accuracy value means, or whether [accuracy is an appropriate metric of performance
    in the first place](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/34193/how-to-choose-an-error-metric-when-evaluating-a-classifier),
    whether your model [overfits](https://towardsdatascience.com/overfitting-vs-underfitting-a-complete-example-d05dd7e19765),
    how your data is distributed, and if you’ve chosen the [right model to fit the
    data](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmd/section4/pmd422.htm) you have,
    etc. There’s just so much more to it even after you’ve answered these questions.

    get a minimal improvement in accuracy, and go home happy. But did you really learn?

    know in the middle of that period whether it interests you. Forget the glamour
    for now, and really get into the depths of this amazing field of research. You
    should definitely read [this](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf).
    I found it to be the best introduction for a newbie in this field. You don’t need
    to know math or code to read it. But after reading this, you will realise the
    entire gamut of concepts you need to understand in order to be fluent with this
    field, to think in ML, so to speak.

    knowledge”. So many people do it, that we frequently lose sight of the bigger
    picture. Machine Learning is wonderful. It is a serious field of research and
    development, and is driving so many 21st century use cases.
