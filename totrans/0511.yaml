- en: As advances in AI continue to progress in leaps and bounds, accessibility to
    data science at a base level has become increasingly democratized. Traditional
    entry barriers to the field such as a lack of data and computing power have been
    swept aside with a continuous supply of new data startups popping up(some offering
    access for as little as a cup of coffee a day) and all powerful cloud computing
    removing the need for expensive onsite hardware. Rounding out the trinity of prerequisites,
    is the skill and know-how to implement, which has arguably become the most ubiquitous
    aspect of data science. One does not need to look far to find online tutorials
    touting taglines like “implement X model in seconds” , “apply Z method to your
    data in just a few lines of code”. In a digital world, instant gratification has
    become the name of the game. While improved accessibility is not detrimental on
    face value, beneath the dazzling array of software libraries and shiny new models,
    the true purpose of data science has become obscured and at times even forgotten.
    For it is not to run complex models for the sake of doing so, or to optimize an
    arbitrary performance metric, but to use as a tool to solve real world problems.

    demonstrate an algorithm without sparing a thought for what a sepal is let alone
    why we measure its length? While these may seem like trivial considerations for
    the budding practitioner who might be more interested in adding a new model to
    their repertoire, it was less than trivial for Edgar Anderson, a botanist, who
    cataloged the attributes in question to understand variations in Iris flowers.
    Despite this being a contrived example it demonstrates a simple point; the mainstream
    has become more focused on “doing” data science rather than “applying” data science.
    However, this misalignment is not the cause for the decline of the data scientist
    but a symptom. To understand the origin of the problem we must step back and take
    a bird’s eye view.

    that leaves the practitioner without a domain. Pharmacy students become pharmacists,
    law students become lawyers, accounting students become accountants. Data science
    students must therefore become data scientists? But data scientists of what? The
    broad application of data science proves to be a double edged sword. On one side,
    it is a powerful toolbox that can be applied to any industry where data is generated
    and captured. On the other, the general applicability of these tools means that
    rarely will the user have true domain knowledge of said industries before the
    fact. Nevertheless, the problem was insignificant during the rise of data science
    as employers rushed to harness this nascent technology without fully understanding
    what it was and how it could be fully integrated into their company.

    in have evolved. They now strive for data science maturity with large entrenched
    teams benchmarked by established industry standards. The pressing hiring demand
    has shifted to problem solvers and critical thinkers who understand the business,
    the respective industry as well as its stakeholders. No longer will the ability
    navigate a couple of software packages or regurgitate a few lines of code suffice,
    nor will a data science practitioner be defined by the ability to code. This is
    evidenced by the increasing popularity of no code, AutoML solutions such as DataRobot,
    RapidMiner and Alteryx.

- en: Data scientists will be extinct in 10 years (give or take), or at least the
    role title will be. Going forward, the skill set collectively known as data science
    will be borne by a new generation of data savvy business specialists and subject
    matter experts who are able to imbue analysis with their deep domain knowledge,
    irrespective of whether they can code or not. Their titles will reflect their
    expertise rather than the means by which they demonstrate it, be it compliance
    specialists, product managers or investment analysts. We don’t need to look back
    far to find historic precedents. During the advent of the spreadsheet, data entry
    specialists were highly coveted, but nowadays, as Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (the
    author of “Storytelling With Data”) aptly observes, proficiency with Microsoft
    Office suite is a bare minimum. Before that, the ability to touch type with a
    typewriter was considered a specialist skill, however with the accessibility of
    personal computing it has also become assumed.

    it may serve you well to constantly refer back to the Venn diagram that you will
    undoubtedly come across. It describes data science as an confluence of statistics,
    programming and domain knowledge. Despite each occupying an equal share of the
    intersecting area, some may warrant a higher weighting than others.
