  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While working with time-based data visualization, Data resampling is crucial
    and very useful. It allows you to control the granularity of the data to extract
    meaningful insights and create visually compelling representations to understand
    it better. In the below picture, you can observe that you can either upsample
    or downsample your time series data in terms of frequencies based on your requirements.

    time intervals at which data points are collected or aggregated. You can get only
    the vital information instead of getting the noise. This can help you remove the
    noisy data, which converts the data to more manageable for visualization.'

    getting from a stock exchange, and you aim to visualize the long-term trends without
    including the noisy data points in your analysis. So, to do this, you can resample
    this daily data to a monthly frequency by taking the average closing price for
    each month, and as a result, the size of the data for visualization purpose decrease,
    and your analysis can provide better insights.

    into monthly intervals and calculated the mean closing price for each month, due
    to which you got the smoother, less noisy representation of the stock price data,
    making it easier to identify long-term trends and patterns for decision making.

- en: When working with time-series data, the main parameter for resampling is the
    frequency, which you must select correctly to get insightful and practical visualizations.
    Basically, there is a tradeoff between granularity, which implies how detailed
    the data is, and clarity, which means how well the data patterns are revealed.

    you have to visualize the annual temperature trend; using minute-level data would
    result in an excessively dense and cluttered plot. On the other hand, if you aggregate
    the data to yearly averages, you might lose valuable information.

- en: In this example, we resample the minute-level temperature data into daily, monthly,
    and yearly averages. Depending on your analytical or visualization goals, you
    can choose the level of detail that best serves your purpose. Daily averages reveal
    daily temperature patterns, while yearly averages provide a high-level overview
    of annual trends.

    data detail with the clarity of your visualizations, ensuring your audience can

    using the sum() aggregation method. By doing this, you can analyze the sales trend
    at different levels of granularity. Monthly totals provide insights into seasonal
    variations, while yearly totals give a high-level overview of the annual performance.

    methods like calculating means and medians or applying custom functions depending
    on the dataset distribution, which is meaningful according to the problem. These
    methods allow you to extract valuable insights from your time-based data by summarizing
    it in a way that makes sense for your analysis or visualization goals.

    temperature values (about 20% of the data) and then used the forward-fill (ffill)
    method to fill in the gaps, which means that the missing values are replaced with
    the temperature from the previous day.

    represent the underlying trends and patterns in the time series, preventing gaps
    from distorting your insights or misleading your audience. Various strategies,
    such as interpolation or backward-filling, can be employed based on the nature
    of the data and the research question.

    irregular patterns in the dataset. Also, to decompose the data into different
    components, we use the seasonal decomposition technique from the statsmodels library,
    including trend, seasonality, and residual components.
