    programs in Data Science. The communication style is cinematographic, using computer
    graphics to mimic a sci-fi action movie, resembling to Minority Effect and Inception,
    through the use of technologies like Oculus rift and multi-touch interfaces. Here
    are the links to their [Bachelor](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/tue-bachelor-college/undergraduate-programs/data-science/)

    scientists and data analysts. The video stresses a lot on how the data is generated,
    its value and how to unleash its power, ending on what characterises a data analyst
    and what instead is peculiar of a data scientist.

    the importance of storytelling in Data Science, I felt that communication is a
    big issue in this field. And I’m not talking only about the visualization and
    reporting. It is old, it is clustered and often self-referential. I am aware I
    may sound bold and even a bit harsh, but what moves me to be this honest is a
    real desire to open Data Science up to the world. A key-performanceparameter should
    be how many tech-illiterate people get to know and familiarise with this field.
    Data Science might not be the holy grail, but it can change the world.

    text metadata of the first 500, most viewed videos on YouTube, from 2014, containing
    the words “data science” and or “data scientist” in their title. Once collected
    all the metadata, I concatenated in a bag of words all the tags, descriptions
    and title. I then used word2vec from gensim python framework. The analysis is
    simple but the results are intreresting.

    (job, career, working, management, industry etc.), “education” (university, courses,
    learning, tutorial, programming etc.) and “data science tools and techniques”
    (machine learning, algorithms etc.). Words like “Future” and “Social” are only
    0.13% of the total. The most similar words to “Future” are again related to “business”
    (job, career, information, product, chief). “Journalism”, “Progress”, “Political”,
    “Psychology” are less than 0.016% of the terms adopted when it comes to videos
    about Data Science. It is a field that also doesn’t seem to be “celebrity-oriented”.
    Dr. DJ Patil is the only influencer “to stand out”: 0.1% of the total number of
    words.'

    the reliability of Data Science for business. I liked his expression “that *Science*
    should remind us of the Galilean experimental scientific method. In this field
    we experiment, a lot. It’s really hard to explain this point.”
