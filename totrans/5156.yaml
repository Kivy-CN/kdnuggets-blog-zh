    No, it''s not deep learning. It''s not statistics. It''s not even Python. Structured
    Query Language (SQL) is used to manage data in a vast array of popular database
    engines, making it critical to access what data scientists (and others) are always
    on the hunt for: data.'

    learning without a dataset? Do you often visualize nonexistent data? These things
    all need... you guessed it: **data** and patience. And while it can''t help you
    with the patience, SQL can certainly help you get data out of relational databases,
    the place where all sorts of organizations decided decades ago to store it. Once
    in-hand, the sciencing of the data can begin.'

- en: And forget about data science altogether; SQL is one of the most popular languages
    out there, period. [Why is SQL popular](https://learnsql.com/blog/should-you-learn-sql/)?
    There are all sort of reasons for this, a few important ones being that it is
    still the industry standard, it is used almost everywhere, and no one has come
    up with a proven better alternative. This all suggests that you should be learning
    SQL.

- en: The following quick reference cheatsheet guide will provide you with the basic
    SQL commands needed to start querying and modifying tables. It will show you how
    to access data from a database, how to filter this data, how to perform joins,
    and even how to make modest table modifications. This is not meant to be an exhaustive
    list of SQL functionality, but rather a starting point. Once you master this subset
    of commands, you should be set to take on some more challenging operations.
