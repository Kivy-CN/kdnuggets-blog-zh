    instance, if you wanted the computer to perform a simple task of adding two numbers,
    you had to spell out every step. However, as our data became more complex, this
    manual approach of giving instructions for each situation became inadequate.

    to learn from examples just like we learn from our experiences. Imagine teaching
    a child how to ride a bicycle by showing it a few times and then letting him fall,
    figure it out, and learn on his own. That's the idea behind Machine Learning.
    This innovation has not only transformed industries but has become an indispensable
    necessity in today's world.

    of puzzle pieces with no picture and your task is to group similar pictures to
    form a complete picture. Clustering is the most common type of unsupervised learning
    where similar data points are grouped into a group. For example, we can employ
    clustering to group similar kinds of social media posts and users can follow the
    sub-topics of their interest.

    the labeled dataset acts as the guiding point in identifying the patterns in data.
    For example, you give a chef a list of the main ingredients to use but do not
    provide the complete recipe. So although they don’t have the recipe some hints
    that might help them to get started.

    environment and gets a reward as a penalty for its actions. With time, it learns
    to maximize the reward and perform well. Imagine that you are training a puppy
    and you give positive feedback by rewarding him when he behaves well and negative
    feedback in the form of withholding rewards. Over time, the puppy learns the actions

    Similarly, we let the model learn from the training data. An important concept
    of learning rate also comes into play here that determines how big of a step your
    model takes during each iteration of training. If you add too much salt or spice
    at once, the dish could become overpowering. Conversely, if you add too little,
    the flavors might not develop fully. The learning rate finds the perfect balance
    for gradual flavor enhancement.
