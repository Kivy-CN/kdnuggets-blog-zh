    methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) because
    [Waterfall](https://airbrake.io/blog/sdlc/waterfall-model) is so old school and
    unsexy. Like me, many of you might have heard this about Agile: iteration allows
    us to learn, test, and fail fast. (*Also, we kill fewer trees by saving papers
    from writing the technical specs that no one reads and probably wrong in the early
    project).*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The Nuance.** There shouldn’t be an arrow pointing back to the Question and
    Evaluation (the green and red text) stages. The iteration principle of Agile **should
    not apply** to the stage when we define the core questions and the evaluation
    metric.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The core question must be clearly articulated as early as possible. Then, the
    sub-questions (see the [hypothesis-driven problem-solving](http://www.consultantsmind.com/2012/09/26/hypothesis-based-consulting/) approach)
    must be thought out immediately. They help to 1) identify good feature ideas and
    drive exploratory analysis, 2) plan the timeline, and 3) decide what each Agile
    Sprint should focus on. The evaluation metric must be picked carefully according
    to the core question. I discuss this process in detail in my [guide](https://www.bizanalyticsbootcamp.com/influence-with-ml-digital).

    because of a misguided definition of the core business question. This led to [data
    leakage](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-leakage-machine-learning/) that
    ruined our model performance. We had to re-code ~35% of our codebase and spend
    ~2 weeks re-trying different data transformation and model architectures. It was
    a nightmare.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Mistake #2:***We prioritized low impact features because our sub-questions
    weren’t well thought out. Well, some of these features were innovative, but not
    useful in retrospect. This wasted valuable development time, which is extremely
    important in a time-boxed consulting setting.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Mistake #3*: **We changed our evaluation metrics. We had to re-design our
    model architecture and re-run the [hyper-parameter search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization).
    This required new test cases. We had to run many regression tests manually.'

    best teacher of ML (Sorry, [Andrew Ng](https://medium.com/u/592ce2a67248?source=post_page-----b91b95b37e35----------------------)).
  prefs: []

- en: Sebastian’s workflow is designed mostly for experimentation-focused ML projects
    (e.g. BI or insight discovery). For the engineering-focused ML projects (e.g.
    full-stack ML systems) like ours, the workflow should be refined based on the
    best practices of software engineering and product management.

    time-boxed consulting or internal prototyping projects. *There is no perfect approach
