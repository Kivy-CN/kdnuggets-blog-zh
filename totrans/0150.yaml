    is only increasing. Why going up? With the recent advancement of generative AI,
    every individual, research group, and company is racing to become the best in
    the field, which makes things more competitive. Although, it’s sometimes hard
    to follow all the latest trends.

    is created. The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence
    (HAI) developed the report with a steering committee from various academic and
    industry fields, and the report's result is intended to give the decision-maker
    and the audience action to advance AI responsibly and ethically.

    machine learning system is a model included in the [Epoch Dataset](https://epochai.org/blog/compute-trends)
    and has specific criteria such as improvement of the state-of-the-art methodology.
