- en: While in data processing, data acquisition, data sorting, and even data manipulation,
    there are some inputs involved that are required by the computer from the machine
    and there are certain outputs that the machine tells the user all of these are
    in the form of certain language. This language is different and difficult to understand
    by both humans and machines. In order to code the input and make it easier for
    machines to understand and vice versa, there are certain languages involved which
    are known as computer programming. All of these come under the wide field of natural
    language processing with the help of which the coding language is translated in
    the form of binary so that the machine can understand, and the binary language
    is being decoded and making it understandable for the human. (Nadkarni et al.,
    2011) Natural language processing is categorized as the subfield of [artificial
    intelligence](https://algoscale.com/artificial-intelligence-solution-providers/).
    A slight demonstration has been shown in the following block diagram which enables
    us to understand how this NLP is related to AI.

- en: While talking about mathematics in NLP, mathematics itself is a vast field and
    there are so many branches of it. For a person who is willing to continue his
    research in the field of NLP and its modeling technique, he must have a knowledge
    of three basic mathematics which are linear algebra, calculus, probability, and
    some basic knowledge of stats. The main question that arises here is whether it
    will require a lot of mathematics for the field of natural language processing.
    The answer to this question depends on the target you want to achieve. Some branches
    of NLP require a lot of mathematics while others need basic math. (*A Learning

    In simple words, while working on NLP there is a lot of possibilities that the
    certain machine or the system logged all the data from the user input. This can
    be explained using a simple example. As discussed earlier in autocorrect in our
    mobile phones NLP is involved. When you type certain words like “I live in” the
    sentence completion algorithm of your mobile phone based on your recent activities
    shows “Los Angeles”. This all has related to some backpropagation, linear algebra,
    and statistics tools. Backpropagation works when the user used different words.
    For example, when we write initially “I live in” the sentence completion shows
    us New York, after certain typing and writing the system knows that after the
    user writes “Los Angeles”, now after every in the system shows us “Los Angeles”
    even if the in is used in some other sentence. After a certain amount of time
    when the user does not use the word “Los Angeles” after the word “in” now the
    system has trained up to that extent that it knows that I should show “Los Angeles”
    when the user writes “live in” otherwise use other words which are used more often
    in the writing or chatting. This is the prime example of backpropagation in NLP.
    In simple words, adjustment of weights in neural networks and minimizing error
    is complete math. (*NLP Text Similarity, How It Works and the Math behind It |

- en: Similarly, statistics have been used in NLP in order to record the data of the
    user and make complete data of which words are used by the user more often. For
    example, a user starts a conversation using “Hello”. Now every time a user opens
    messenger or WhatsApp there is a hello that appears at the beginning. This all
    is possible due to the recent data recorded by the system and texts show up according
    to the style adopted by the user. This statistical analysis of the data of the
    user has also used probability distribution as well. For example, with proper
    training and error removal, and backpropagation the system gets trained so well
    that it came up with exciting suggestions. Another example of the involvement
    of probability and statistics in NLP is google search history or YouTube search
    history. The basic aim of statistical NLP is to take some data having some unknown
    probability distribution and make some interference about it having some known
    probability distribution. Now with the help of these results from probability
    distribution statistical data has been calculated and refined search has been
    obtained just as mentioned earlier in google search type platforms etc. (*What
    Is Natural Language Processing?*, 2017)
