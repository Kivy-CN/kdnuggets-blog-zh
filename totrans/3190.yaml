    Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/) ([paper](https://www.gwern.net/docs/rl/2017-silver.pdf)).
    Not only does this new approach improve in some of the most promising directions
    (e.g. deep reinforcement learning), but it also represents a paradigm shift in
    which such models can learn without data. We have also learned very recently that
    the Alpha Go Zero [generalizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815) to other games
    such as chess. You can read more about my interpretation of this advance in my
    [Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-significance-of-AlphaGo-Zero-in-AI-research/answer/Xavier-Amatriain).

    up steam and becoming a real challenge to Tensorflow, especially in research.
    Tensorflow quickly reacted by releasing dynamic networks in [Tensorflow Fold](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-tensorflow-fold-deep.html).
    The “AI War” between big players has many other battles though, with the most
    heated one happening around the Cloud. All the main providers have really stepped
    up and increase their AI support in the cloud. Amazon has presented large innovations
    in their AWS, such as their recent presentation of [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
    to build and deploy ML model. It is also worth mentioning that smaller players
    are also jumping in. Nvidia, has recently introduced their [GPU cloud](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/),
    which promises to be another interesting alternative to train Deep Learning models.
    Despite all these battles, it is good to see that industry can come together when
    necessary. The new [ONNX](http://onnx.ai/) standardization of neural network representations
    is an important and necessary step forward to interoperability.

    a big impact on critical areas such as health care, legal systems, engineering
    and the financial industry. However, the majority of machine learning models are
    not easily interpretable. Understanding how a model achieved a prediction is particularly
    crucial in profiling and diagnostic models, where the human must be confident
    enough to trust the prediction presented by the model. Importantly, the decisions
    made by some machine learning models must be aligned with laws and regulations.
    Now is the time to create deep learning models which are transparent enough to
    explain their predictions, especially when the outcomes of these models are used
    to influence or inform human decisions.
