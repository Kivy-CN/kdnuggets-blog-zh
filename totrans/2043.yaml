- en: We always deem data science as the “sexiest job of the 21st century.” When it
    comes to the transformation from a traditional company to an analytical company,
    either the company or the data scientists would expect to dive into the fancy
    world of analytics as soon as possible. But, is it always the case?

    Hilti, a leading manufacturing company in power tools and related services, we
    had provisioned several splendid blueprints: automation of pricing, propensity
    model…Working with such a great company was such a precious opportunity for us
    that we could barely wait to exploit our analytical skills to create business
    value. But when we started to tap into the data, we found that it is hard for
    us to directly acquire clean and structured data from a traditional company, as
    compared to from a data-driven company such as e-commerce companies.'

    I witnessed how we were hindered in the analytical progress due to the unready
    data.

    operations, was actually taking charge of the database. In the beginning, the
    process was heavily lagged because we could barely request and inquire about the
    data or people in time. Moreover, as the sales data of Hilti was sensitive and
    the company lacked a secure way to transfer data, a time-consuming masking process
    was needed upon every request of data. Thirdly, weak data engineering led to the
    inconsistency among several referring tables, and we could barely proceed with
    a solid model or conclusion. Finally, we have to deal with various data types:
    CSV, JSON, SQLite, etc…Indeed a good chance to learn, though.'

    discussed and solved.

    a taste of the fresh data. However, the most embarrassing thing happened when
    we were presenting the first proposal with actual figures.

    we realized that we didn’t receive the complete data at all. We were only focusing
    on the detail of data, such as anomalies and relationships among data sources,
    but we forgot to do the basic checks such as sum and count. This is a lesson that
    I would remember for a lifetime. Truly!

- en: The most important thing that I learned from the data engineering drama is that
    the kind of roles working behind the scene, such as data engineers, are actually
    holding the gateway of innovation. When a traditional company considers exploiting
    their data, the most efficient and first-step action should be improving the data
    engineering process. With good data engineers, the company can build a healthy
    and scalable data pipeline making it much easier for data analysts to carry out
    data mining and finding business insights.

- en: I also learned that why a lot of companies require their data analysts to have
    knowledge in programming related tools, such as Python and Scala, apart from analytics
    tools such as SQL and Excel. Usually, we cannot expect a “full-stack” analyst,
    but it is necessary that we have someone who can communicate with both engineering
    people and management people. Although a clear allocation of work is important
    for high efficiency, a guru of every data tool is indeed attractive.

    front side and the backside, such as Java, JavaScript, Kafka, Spark, and Hive,
    and I believe eventually, they would be the sparkling point in my experience.
