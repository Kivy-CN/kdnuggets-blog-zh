- en: Since we wrote ModelDB 1.0, a pioneering model versioning system, we have learned
    a lot and adapting it to the evolving ecosystem became a challenge. Hence we decided
    to rebuild from the ground up to support a model versioning system tailored to
    make ML development and deployment reliable, safe, and reproducible.

    We would like to thank all of our partners who inspired and helped design, test,
    and validate this release.

- en: Back when we first created ModelDB 1.0, we only tracked metadata about models.
    However, having partnered with many organizations (in regulated industries and
    others) to operationalize their models, we learned that this isn’t enough. While
    extensive, metadata, does not enable you to go forward or backward in time to
    a specific state of a model. For instance, with metadata alone, you cannot go
    back to the exact state when a model was created three months back. So we built
    a new model versioning solution inspired by Git to manage all the ingredients
    to create a model: **dataset, code, environment, and config**.

- en: ModelDB 1.0 was able to store model information, but did not support authentication
    and authorization. These are essential feature-sets to ensure that your data stays
    secured, especially for enterprises. So in ModelDB 2.0 we are now finally adding
    the necessary interfaces so that you can know exactly who did what and when, ensuring
    only authorized users have access. This will now also enable users to isolate
    sets of experiments for different teams.
