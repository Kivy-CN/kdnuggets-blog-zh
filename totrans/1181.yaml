    is the most popular programming language in data science, especially when it comes
    to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

    tested in the data science interview. Later on, I will discuss two main interview
    question types that cover those concepts you’re required to know as a data scientist.
    I’ll also show you several example questions and give you solutions to push you
    in the right direction.

- en: This guide is not company-specific. So if you have some data science interviews
    lined up, I strongly advise you to use this guide as a starting point of what
    might come up in the interview. Additionally, you should also try to find some
    company-specific questions and try to solve them too. Knowing general concepts
    and practicing them on real-life questions is a winning combination.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ll not bother you with theoretical questions. They can come up in the interview,
    but they too cover the technical concepts found in the coding questions. After
    all, if you know how to use the concepts I’ll be talking about, you probably know
    to explain them too.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data types are the concept you should be familiar with. This means you should
    know the most commonly used data types in Python, the difference between them,
    when and how to use them. Those are data-types such as integers (int), floats
    (float), complex (complex), strings (str), booleans (bool), null values (None).
  prefs: []

- en: 2\. Built-in Data Structures
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are list, dictionary, tuple, and sets. Knowing these four built-in data
    structures will help you organize and store data in a way that will allow easier
    access and modifications.

- en: 3\. User-defined Data Structures
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On top of using the built-in data structures, you should also be able to define
    and use some of the user-defined data structures. These are arrays, stack, queue,
    trees, linked lists, graphs, HashMaps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Built-in Functions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python has over 60 built-in functions. You don’t need to know them all while,
    of course, it’s better to know as many as possible. The built-in functions you
    can’t avoid are abs(), isinstance(), len(), list(), min(), max(), pow(), range(),
    round(), split(), sorted(), type().

- en: 5\. Loops and Conditionals
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Loops are used in repetitive tasks when they perform one piece of code over
    and over again. They do that until the conditionals (true/false tests) tell them
    to stop.

    popular. It is designed for practical data analysis in finance, social sciences,
    statistics, and engineering.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For a data science interview, the six technical concepts I’ve mentioned are
    a must. Of course, it’s recommended you dive even deeper into Python and broaden
    your knowledge. Not only theoretically but also practicing by solving as many
    as possible both data manipulation and analysis and algorithm questions.

    You could probably find the questions from the company where you applied for a
    job. And [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a good choice when you decide to
    practice writing Python algorithms before your interviews.
