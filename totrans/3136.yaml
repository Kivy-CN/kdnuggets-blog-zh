    and sequence-centric methods. The scope of coverage is vast, and it includes traditional
    information retrieval methods and also recent methods from neural networks and
    deep learning. The chapters of this book can be organized into three categories:'

- en: '**Classical machine learning methods:**  These chapters discuss the classical
    machine learning methods such as matrix factorization, topic modeling, dimensionality
    reduction, clustering, classification, linear models, and evaluation. All these
    techniques treat text as a bag of words. Contextual learning methods that combine
    different types of text and also combine text with heterogeneous data types are
    covered.'

- en: '**Classical information retrieval and search engines:**  Although this book
    is focussed on text mining, the importance of retrieval and ranking methods in
    mining applications is quite significant. Therefore, the book covers the key aspects
    of information retrieval, such as data structures, Web ranking, crawling, and
    search engine design. Importance is given to different types of information retrieval
    scoring models and learning-to-rank techniques.'

- en: '**Sequence-centric, deep learning, and linguistic methods for mining:**  While
    the bag-of-words representation can be useful for traditional applications like
    classification and clustering, more advanced applications like machine translation,
    image captioning, opinion mining, information extraction, and text segmentation
    require one to treat text as a sequence. These chapters discuss methods for sequence-centric
    mining methods such as deep learning techniques, word2vec, recurrent neural networks,
    LSTMs, maximum entropy Markov models, and Conditional Random Fields. Custom methods
    for applications like text summarization, opinion mining, and event detection
    are also discussed.'

    it is also designed to be useful to researchers and industrial practitioners.
    It therefore contains extensive bibliographic references for researchers, and
    the bibliographic section also contains software references for practitioners.
    Numerous examples and exercises have been provided.

    The hardcover is available at all the usual channels (e.g, Amazon, Barnes and
    Noble etc.), in Kindle format, and also directly from Springer in hardcopy and
    pdf format. The electronic version is available at the following** [**Springerlink

    computer to regulate access. To be eligible, your institution must subscribe to
    "e-book package english (Computer Science)" or "e-book package english (full collection)".
    Aside from the fact that the PDF version is freely downloadable from subscribing
    institutions, it is preferable to the paid Kindle version in terms of formatting.
    The electronic PDF does have embedded links and you can also load it on a Kindle
    reader.**'
