- en: In the era of advanced language model applications, developers and data scientists
    are continuously seeking efficient tools to build, deploy, and manage their projects.
    As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 gain popularity, more people are looking
    to leverage these powerful models in their own applications. However, working
    with LLMs can be complex without the right tools.

    a composability approach to build applications with LLMs. It is widely used to
    develop context-aware applications by integrating different sources of context
    with language models. Additionally, it can use a language model to reason about
    actions or responses based on the context provided. The LangChain AI team has
    recently introduced LangSmith, a new tool that provides a unified development
    platform to increase the speed and efficiency of LLM application production.'
