- en: Cloud computing has opened new doors for app development and hosting. Before
    cloud services became mainstream, developers had to maintain their own expensive
    servers. Now, cloud platforms like AWS and Azure provide easy database hosting
    without the high hardware costs. Cloud databases offer the flexibility and convenience
    of the cloud while providing standard database functionality. They can be relational,
    NoSQL, or any other database model, accessed via API or web interface.
