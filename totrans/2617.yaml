- en: For the past 3 months, I was tasked with building a machine learning model to
    predict whether a product should be [RMA'ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_merchandise_authorization) or
    not. I would say that this was the first “serious” machine learning model that
    I’ve ever developed — and I say “serious” in quotes because this was the first
    model that created actual business value.

    ups and downs throughout building the model — why? I spent a lot of time learning
    new concepts that I didn’t already know. In this article, I wanted to reflect
    and document what I wish I knew before building this model.

- en: Something that I recently came across was [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/),
    which is a Python package that allows you to build and deploy a web app for your
    machine learning model in as little as three lines of code. It serves the same
    purpose as Streamlit or Flask, but I found it much faster and easier to get a
    model deployed.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Why is this so useful? A couple of reasons:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**It allows for further model validation**. Specifically, it allows you to
    interactively test different inputs into the model. This also allows you to get
    feedback from other stakeholders and domain experts, especially from non-coders.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**It’s a good way to conduct demos**. Personally, I found that showing a Jupyter
    Notebook to certain stakeholders didn’t do my model any justice, despite it performing
    very well. Using a library like this makes it easier to communicate your results
    and sell yourself better.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**It’s easy to implement and distribute**. To reiterate, there’s a tiny learning
    curve, as it only takes 3 lines of code to implement this. As well, it’s really
    easy to distribute because the web app is accessible by anyone through a public
    link.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Feature importance refers to a set of techniques for assigning scores to input
    variables based on how good they are at predicting the target variable. The higher
    the score, the more *important*the feature is in the model.

- en: For example, if I wanted to predict the price of a car using the features in
    the graph, by conducting feature importance, I can determine that the **year **of
    the model, whether it’s **front-wheel drive **or not, and the **mileage **(odometer)
    of the car are the most important factors when predicting the price of a car.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pretty awesome right? I bet you’re starting to see why this is so useful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Feature importance is really useful when it comes to feature selection. By conducting
    feature importance on a preliminary model, you can easily determine which features
    have a say in the model and which don’t.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More importantly, feature importance makes it easier to interpret your model
    and explain your findings because it directly tells you what features are the
    most indicative of the target variable.

    and communication.**'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The essence of machine learning is finding model *parameters*that best fit a
    dataset. This is done through training the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, **hyperparameters **are parameters that cannot be directly
    learned from the model training process. These are higher-level concepts about
    the model that are generally fixed before training the model.

    data itself, setting the right hyperparameters can improve your machine learning
    model from an 80% accuracy to a 95%+ accuracy. This was what happened in my case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now to my main point, there are techniques that you can use that will automatically
    optimize your model’s hyperparameters for you, so that you don’t have to test
    a bunch of different numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two of the most common techniques are **grid search **and **random search**,
    which you can read more about [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/hyperparameter-optimization-with-random-search-and-grid-search/).
