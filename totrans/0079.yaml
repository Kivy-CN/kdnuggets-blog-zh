    yes. This year alone there were a lot of advancements, one after another and it
    was hard for us to keep up. It seemed like every day we were learning something
    new and were on our toes.

    (AGI) is becoming more and more frequent. It was once a conversation of science
    fiction, which we saw in movies and books, in which those storylines were a bit
    far-fetched and unrealistic.

    has a big interest in AI and how it is going to shape the future. Generative AI
    systems such as ChatGPT have swept the world off their feet, with some loving
    it, and some concerned about job replacements.

    of intellectual task, the same way a human can.

    we are to actually achieving AGI and what will happen when we do.

- en: So we know that AGI is an AI system that can perform any intellectual task that
    a human being can. This means that machines will have to possess human-level intelligence,
    without any help. The groundwork for AI began in the early 1900s, with many stating
    that achieving AGI would complete the ultimate goal of the AI legacy.

    tasks at a highly accurate level, better than humans. However, there is something
    that is missing with AI systems, and that is their general-purpose ability. This
    means that they lack the ability to adapt to new situations in a quick manner,
    without the need for instructions.
  id: totrans-19

    situations. Our general-purpose ability links to survival, this is why we’re so
    good at it.

    world, one in particular is Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT. I’d like to
    state that Generative AI and Artificial General intelligence have their similarities,
    but they are different. Generative AI is a deep learning model that has the ability
    to generate content such as text and images, based on the data it was trained
    on.

    chess game, but the same AI system will not be able to tell you about what’s currently
    happening in world politics. This is because it is limited to a specific domain,
    and that’s all.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we mentioned, AGI lacks general-purpose ability, which is also what Generative
    AI lacks - as that is not its purpose. Generative AI will aid AGI in its journey,
    but it is important to note that they are not the same.

    of machine learning. It is a machine learning method that teaches computers to
    do what comes naturally to humans. It trains an algorithm to predict outputs,
    given a set of inputs.

    AI systems to be able to tackle complex tasks such as natural language processing
    (NLP) and image recognition. There is a lot of learning and improvement happening
    in the deep learning industry to aid the birth of AGI.

    The aim of reinforcement learning is to train a model to return an optimum solution
    by using a sequence of solutions and/or decisions that have been created for a
    specific problem. In order for the model to choose the right solution/decision,
    a reward signal is put in place.

- en: If the model performs closer to the goal, a positive reward is given; however,
    if the model performs further away from the goal, a negative reward is given.
    Machine learning models learn by understanding their environment and receiving
    feedback based on their actions.

- en: Naturally, during the progression of anything, you will come across challenges
    that you need to overcome. In the matter of research and development, the major
    challenge that AGI is facing is the ability to build a system that can understand
    the input context and adapt to it the same way humans do. Researchers are looking
    into new ways that an algorithm can think more in a creative manner to overcome
    this. For example, some researchers are looking at the possibility of intelligent
    AI systems that go through continual learning throughout their lifespan.

    require a lot of computing power, which has pushed the development of specialized
    hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. And these hardware are not cheap either. So you
    can imagine how many weeks and months it takes to build an accurate and robust
    AI system with the amount of time, data, and other resources that go into it.

- en: It is difficult to say because the experts of AGI have mixed opinions. Some
    say that AGI could be achieved in the next few years, whilst others believe that
    we still have decades' worth of work left.

- en: The only thing that can determine how close we are to AGI is the rate of technological
    advancements that come through. The more advanced current and new technological
    systems get, the closer experts are to finding the missing parts of the puzzle.
    The more breakthroughs we see in the tech world, the closer we are to AGI.

- en: Another aspect that governments and organizations are taking into consideration
    now more than ever is the ethical implications of such AI systems to society.
    Pushing a narrative on AGI could lead to disastrous consequences of not being
    able to understand and control these AI systems.
