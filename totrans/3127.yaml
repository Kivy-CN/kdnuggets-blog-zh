- en: As a data scientist who has been in the profession for several years now, I
    am often approached for career advice or guidance in course selection related
    to machine learning by students and career switchers on LinkedIn and Quora. Some
    questions revolve around educational paths and program selection, but many questions
    focus on what sort of algorithms or models are common in data science today.

    Courses may include algorithms that aren’t typically used in industry today, and
    courses may exclude very useful methods that aren’t trending at the moment. Software-based
    programs may exclude important statistical concepts, and mathematically-based
    programs may skip over some of the key topics in algorithm design.

- en: I’ve put together a short guide for aspiring data scientists, particularly focused
    on statistical models and machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised);
    many of these topics are covered in textbooks, graduate-level statistics courses,
    data science bootcamps, and other training resources (some of which are included
    in the reference section of the article). Because machine learning is a branch
    of statistics, machine learning algorithms technically fall under statistical
    knowledge, as well as data mining and more computer-science-based methods. However,
    because some algorithms overlap with computer science course material and because
    many people separate out traditional statistical methods from new methods, I will
    separate the two branches in the list.

    specialized areas of data science and machine learning, and folks entering those
    fields are usually specialists in that particular area already.
