  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Make your first hires count! At this early stage, think of your ML team as a
    startup within a startup. It’s often better to look for generalist candidates
    who have broad skill sets and are used to working across the machine learning
    development process. Your ideal candidates will have worked in a similar startup
    environment—folks who can get creative with limited resources. This is because,
    in enterprises, roles are more specialized, and teams have greater resources to
    deploy to solve problems. Your early hires will need to do everything until you’re
    ready to expand the team.
  prefs: []

    create product requirements and manage the roadmap. If you hire a PM, firsthand
    ML experience is a must. You may also be able to find a senior scientist who can
    take on the PM role temporarily.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our experience, it’s better not to worry about the process and tooling for
    the first project. Let the team figure it out and do what they need to get the
    first product through the door. Make sure the ML team has the flexibility to select
    the computation resources they need. Compared to software engineering, the computation
    requirements (cores, RAM, GPU, etc.) changes much faster, which makes it challenging
    to pre-order the machines needed. Cloud platforms usually are more time- and cost-efficient.

    this is risky. Projects that are too ambitious can take longer to bring to market
    or even fail. There are many causes for delays: your data might be messier than
    thought, you might uncover additional requirements, or you might not have a process
    for deployment. Delays cause a loss of confidence and support over time and could
    be terminal for an embryonic ML team.'
