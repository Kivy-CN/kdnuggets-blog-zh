- en: At the beginning of their career, Data Scientists think that Data Science is
    a wonderful, **magical world** full of algorithms, **Python **functions that performs
    every possible spell with **a line of code** and statistical models able to detect
    the most useful **correlations **among data that could make you an invincible **superhero **in
    your company. You start dreaming about your CEO congratulating with you and shaking
    your hand, you begin to see **decision trees** and **clusters** everywhere and,
    of course, the most terrifying **neural network** architectures your mind can
    dream.

    satisfied **here and now**.
  prefs: []

    a result **can’t be reached**. Think about **clustering**, for example. You can
    spend an entire life searching for a clustering pattern that simply doesn’t exist
    in your data. Most managers don’t understand this fact, and it can be **very stressful **for
    you and your team.

    Never forget this. No sane manager in the world would follow an unknown algorithm
    for managing their company’s money only because its AUROC is greater than 95%.
    Managers **need to understand** algorithms, figure out how they **think **about
    data, and this is often a great task for a Data Scientist. Explaining algorithms
    to somebody with no scientific background can be quite difficult, but it’s **very
    common **in large companies, and you must face this fact.

    themselves whether you are useful or not in your company.'

    implies lines of log files that you need to understand. Data isn’t everything; **information

    need somebody telling you where you should dig.

    bullets in your shotgun. Maybe you have magic formulas in your mind, graphs, and
    so on. Forget about them. Data Science is told by **graphical representations,**
    and it’s often difficult to find the proper visualization technique suitable for
    your audience.

    allowed to delay a second. In Data Science, things aren’t easier.

    difficulty **inside them: Data Science is something very close to **academic research**,
    so it doesn’t fit well in the classical **waterfall **ITC project management style.
    Instead, some **Agile framework **(e.g., Scrum or Kanban) should work well, due
    to its physiological ability to quickly **adapt to changes**. But Agile is difficult
    to teach to managers. It can give them the false idea that there’s **no clear
    delivery date **and this is very difficult to accept by companies.'

    algorithms, cross-validation, and so on. The technical and **nerdy real fun **is
    a very small part of the work, and it takes very little time in the whole project
    lifetime. Maybe you have already **lost enthusiasm **in the previous phases before
    writing your first line of code, and things no longer seem as funny as you thought
    at the beginning.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to my experience, I can answer with a single word: **Agile**. There’s
    no need to perform all the business understanding part before writing your first
    Python code line. Start with a **simple business understanding **of a small piece
    of data, explore it, **visualize it,  **and begin with a **simple model**. Create
    the first, quantifiable results **week by week **keeping your **customers constantly
    engaged **in the process. Deliver **small results **with a **constant delivery
    rate **and, please, don’t fall into the waterfall trap.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Simplicity is the key**. Never forget it. Start with the simplest things
    possible and add a small piece of complexity only if needed.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s a psychological sense of **relief **in constant, small results, and
    this is another weapon you have to use if you want to survive in the jungle of
    companies’ deadlines and business processes. In this way, every colleague of yours
    who is committed to your project will **feel your difficulties **and start to
    understand how difficult Data Science is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember, companies still think about Data Science as an **ITC branch**; they
    are not completely wrong, but they shouldn’t expect you to follow the waterfall
    approach. So, you have to suffer the struggle to guide your company toward an **Agile
    way of thinking**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Concerning the **explanation **part of the job, I prefer to start with the **simplest
    machine learning model **possible: **k-nearest neighbors**. It’s very easy to
    understand. You only need paper, a pencil and a Cartesian plane with some points
    drawn on it. That’s it. If it produces very nice results, everybody will finally
    see you like the great business partner you think you are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If KNN doesn’t work, then you can use **regressions **and **decision trees **(random
    forests, gradient boosted tree classifiers, and so on), which are very easy to
    explain, or **Bayesian networks**, which have a very useful graphical representation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, visualize. **Visualize everything**. Ask your boss to buy you a **course
    in data visualization**, learn as much as possible about the best visualization
    techniques, and, please, remember to **avoid pie charts**. They are pretty useless
    and misleading. If you provide a simple **scatter **or **bar plot**, people will
    catch all the relevant information.

    results about a time series analysis using only **three slides**: high-level **KPIs** describing
    the business phenomenon, a **confusion matrix**, and some **performance metrics**.
    Our audience was enthusiastic since the first slide, only because we started with
    clear numbers explaining the business in a simple way. In many situations, a **small
    building block** can really save your life.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Science is an exciting job, but it can be very difficult to perform if
    you speak to a non-technical audience. Data and business are intimately related
    to each other, and you must remember this point when you work with business-oriented
    people. The only way to survive is to **find a middle point **between a **data-driven** bottom-up
    approach and a **business-driven** top-down approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, as Data Science is hard and **time-consuming**, delivering small results
    with a constant delivery rate is the only way you can keep your customers engaged.
