    and business circles for core AI/ML tasks, they have found less coverage in their
    utility for regular data science and data engineering tasks. However, using GPUs
    for regular day-to-day statistical analyses or other data science tasks can go
    a long way towards becoming the proverbial *"Productive Data Scientist*".
