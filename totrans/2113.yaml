- en: Building home-grown LLMs is a significant technological step and calls for its
    merit. Predominantly, it sets a precedent for everyone to be part of this digital
    transformation, making a win-win for both – by allowing wider reach to customers
    as well as enabling businesses to expand their reach, connect, and serve diverse
    customer bases across the world.

    ease of access to information, and enhancing customer experience.

- en: The LLMs trained on diverse linguistic spread cover all three grounds, providing
    easy and timely access to the information. Such facilitation of knowledge at the
    fingertips can help many local communities get the much-needed help and support
    to get their inquiries resolved.

    equally important to call out that such model development requires access to data
    in local languages. Needless to say, it might appear challenging at first but
    is not unachievable.

    labeling (more on this in the coming section), when data collection processes
    are built efficiently at scale.

    funding the R&D in cutting-edge technology and building self-sufficiency in hardware.
    Further, the large models are heavily dependent on data centers that require extensive
    power, raising the need for power-efficient chips.

    of that digital world aka data so the next wave of new models includes them too,
    solving the case of misrepresentation going forward.

    to some at face value. Still, once done efficiently at scale, it can quickly become
    an opportunity to provide wage opportunities to the contributors. Local communities
    can participate in such data generation initiatives and participate in this revolution
    at the foundational level while getting recognized for playing their part in the
    form of wages and royalties for their contribution.

    equalizer. The ratio of “teachers, lawyers, doctors support” to the “population”
    is reportedly low in developing nations compared to developed nations, clearly
    highlighting the gap that can be efficiently bridged by applications helping the
    customers resolve issues in the early stages or receive guidance to the next steps.
    This becomes feasible if the user is comfortable with the conversational language
    of AI-powered chatbots.

    advancements. Most importantly, such inclusivity puts the much-needed focus on
    the marginalized sections and makes them a key participant in this revolutionary
