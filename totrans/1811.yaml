- en: Data science interviews are daunting, complicated gauntlets for many. But despite [the
    ways they're evolving](http://www.fastcompany.com/3062713/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/i-hire-engineers-at-google-heres-what-i-look-for-and-why),
    the technical portion of the typical data science interview tends to be pretty
    predictable. The [questions most candidates](https://www.springboard.com/resources/data-scientist-interview-guide) face
    usually cover behavior, mathematics, statistics, coding, and scenarios. However
    they differ in their particulars, those questions may be easier to answer if you
    can identify which bucket each one falls into. Here's a breakdown, and what you
    can do to prepare.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**1\. BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to any other interview, these questions are meant to test for your [soft
    skills](https://www.fastcompany.com/3059940/the-future-of-work/these-are-the-biggest-skills-that-new-graduates-lack) and
    see if you fit in culturally with the company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Example: What have you liked and disliked about your previous position?
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The intent here is to identify whether the role you’re interviewing for suits
    your personality and temperament, and to identify [why you’re moving on](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062748/hit-the-ground-running/how-to-explain-to-hiring-managers-why-youre-looking-for-a-job)from
    a previous position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Don''t overthink it or imagine that the key here is really any different from
    any other type of interview: Just understand the role well, avoid talking about
    issues you''ve had in the past with specific people, and be professional when
    describing what you disliked and why. A data science role may call for an analytical
    mind, but hiring managers still want to hear what makes you passionate.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**2\. MATHEMATICS QUESTIONS**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientist roles where you're expected not only to implement algorithms
    but also tweak them for specific purposes will usually come with mathematical
    questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Example: How does the linear regression algorithm determine what the best coefficient
    values are?
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The point is to see how deeply you understand linear regression, which is critical
    because in many data science roles you won’t just work with algorithms in a black
    box; you’ll actually put them into action. This category of question tests how
    much you know about what's actually happening beneath the surface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is one of those "show your work" moments. Trace out every step of your
    thinking and write down the equations. As you’re writing out the solution, describe
    your thought process so the interviewer can see your mathematical logic at work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**3\. STATISTICS QUESTIONS**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It goes without saying that a strong grasp of statistics is important for solving
    different data science problems. Chances are you’ll be tested on your ability
    to reason statistically and your knowledge of statistical theory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Example: What is the difference between Type I error and Type II error?
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Proving your mettle requires showing you understand the fundamentals of statistics.
    But more than that, interviewers also want to see whether you're capable of using
    the technical language and logic of statistics to grapple with ideas you may not
    often approach that way—and still communicate them clearly. So be no-nonsense
    in your response. Use the relevant statistical knowledge to arrive at your answer,
    but be as direct as possible about whatever you're asked to define.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**4\. CODING QUESTIONS**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A big part of most data sciences roles is programming to implement algorithms
    at scale. These questions are similar to the ones candidates face in software
    engineering interviews; they're meant to test your experience with the technical
    tools a company uses and your overall knowledge of programming theory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Example: Develop a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Showing you can write out the thinking *behind* an algorithm and deploy it efficiently
    under time constraints is a great way to demonstrate your engineering skills.
    This kind is usually posed to data scientists who have a knowledge both of algorithms
    and their technical implementation, or data engineers who are given some context
    on what the algorithm is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In any event, this type of question tests your understanding of matrix computation
    and how to deal with vectors and matrices. So start by going through a sample
    set of inputs and outputs, and manually work out the answer. As you do, keep an
    eye on [time/space complexity](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18686121/differences-between-time-complexity-and-space-complexity).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**5\. SCENARIO QUESTIONS**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last but not least, scenario questions are designed to test your experience
    and knowledge in different fields of data science, to find out the practical limits
    of your abilities. Demonstrate your applied knowledge as thoroughly as you can,
    and you’ll come off well in any case analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Example: If you were a data scientist at a web company that sells shoes, how
    would you build a system that recommends shoes to visitors?
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This question is meant to see how you envision your work delivering products
    or services from end to end. Scenario questions don’t test for knowledge in every
    field; they're meant to explore a product's life cycle from beginning to delivery
    and see what limits the candidate might have at each stage of that process. But
    these questions also evaluate holistic knowledge—for instance, what it takes to
    manage a team to deliver a final product—to determine how candidates perform in
    team situations.

- en: 'Here, too, the usual job-interview advice applies: Be honest about where you
    can add a lot of value, but don’t be shy about where you expect to get a little
    bit of help from your teammates. Try to relate how your technical knowledge can
    help with business outcomes, and always explain the thought process behind your
    choices and the assumptions that guide them. And [don’t hesitate to ask questions](http://www.fastcompany.com/3053473/hit-the-ground-running/7-interview-questions-that-can-help-you-land-your-dream-job) that
    can help you suss out an interviewer''s intentions so you can better tailor your
    answers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science interviews can be tricky straddling acts—you're challenged to program
    and come up with technical algorithms on the spot, but you're also measured by
    much the same criteria for nontechnical roles. Your statistical and mathematical
    knowledge will be tested, as will your ability to lead a team, communicate, persuade,
    and influence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So instead of trying to prepare for every imaginable question, prepare for these
    five *types* of question. You can't anticipate every question that's thrown at
    you, but you can pretty accurately forecast what a hiring manager's needs and
    expectations might be—then set yourself up to meet them.
