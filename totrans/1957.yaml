    a particular data field is about. You can read theoretical explanations and job
    descriptions and listen to YouTube videos explaining them, but your understanding
    always stays at that I-get-it-but-not-quite level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    engineering is and [what data engineers do](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/what-does-a-data-engineer-do-and-what-they-dont-do/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+de+project+ideas).
    And we’ll start with that. But you should complement this theoretical knowledge
    with practice; at their intersection lies real knowledge.

- en: Practicing data engineering is quite difficult without actually working at a
    company as a data engineer. This is mainly because data engineering is not only
    about handling data but also about data architecture and building data infrastructure.

    and various data sources to data storage, where it’s available to data users.
    In between, data is also processed, analyzed, and transformed into a format suitable
    for use.

- en: Due to the nature of data engineering, it’s impossible to think of a project
    that will deal with only one aspect of it; such is the wholesomeness of a data
    engineer’s job. It isn’t really possible to do a project that only does data processing
    – OK, but where does this data come from, and where does it end?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, most projects I’ve chosen are end-to-end data engineering projects that
    will teach you how to build a data pipeline – the essence of data engineering.
    However, the projects take different approaches and different technologies, so
    there are some aspects you can learn from one project that you can’t learn from
    another.
