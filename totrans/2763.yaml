    background requirement in linear algebra and optimization. This makes the learning
    curve very steep. This book, therefore, reverses the focus by teaching linear
    algebra and optimization as the primary topics of interest, and solutions to machine
    learning problems as applications of these methods. Therefore, the book also provides
    significant exposure to machine learning. The chapters of this book belong to
    two categories:'

    of linear algebra together with their common applications to singular value decomposition,
    similarity matrices (kernel methods), and graph analysis. Numerous machine learning
    applications have been used as examples, such as spectral clustering, kernel-based
    classification, and outlier detection.'

- en: '**Optimization and its applications:** Basic methods in optimization such as
    gradient descent, Newton''s method, and coordinate descent are discussed. Constrained
    optimization methods are introduced as well. Machine learning applications such
    as linear regression, SVMs, logistic regression, matrix factorization, recommender
    systems, and K-means clustering are discussed in detail. A general view of optimization
    in computational graphs is discussed together with its applications to backpropagation
    in neural networks.'

- en: Exercises are included both within the text of the chapters and at the end of
    the chapters. The book is written for a diverse audience, including graduate students,
    researchers, and practitioners. The book is available in both hardcopy (hardcover)
    and electronic versions. In case an electronic version is desired, it is strongly
    recommended to buy the PDF version (as opposed to the Kindle version for which
    it is hard for Springer to control layout and formatting of equations) at the
    following **[Springerlink pointer](https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-40344-7)**.
    For subscribing institutions **click from a computer directly connected to your
    institution network to download the book for free**. Springer uses the domain
    name of your computer to regulate access. To be eligible, your institution must
    subscribe to "e-book package english (Computer Science)" or "e-book package english
    (full collection)". If your institution is eligible, you will see a (free) `Download
