- en: HuggingChat is a free and open source alternative to commercial chat offerings
    such as ChatGPT. In theory, the service could leverage numerous models, yet I
    have only seen it use LLaMa 30B SFT 6 ([oasst-sft-6-llama-30b](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor))
    from [OpenAssistant](https://open-assistant.io/) thus far.

- en: You can find out all about OpenAssistant's interesting efforts to build their
    chatbot [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFa539R09EQ). While the model may
    not be GPT4 level, it is definitely a capable LLM with an interesting training
    story that is worth checking out.

- en: The barebones sample script takes input and passes it to the API, displaying
    the results as they are returned. The only interpretation of input by the script
    is to look for a keyword to quit, a keyword to start a new conversation, or a
    keyword to change to a pre-existing alternative conversation that you already
    have underway. All are self-explanatory.

    that you are free to explore without a hit to your wallet. You are only limited
    by your imagination.
