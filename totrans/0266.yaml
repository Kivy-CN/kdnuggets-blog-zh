- en: Strictly speaking, this isn’t a research paper, it’s a report from the Stanford
    University *One hundred year study* of Artificial Intelligence, “a long-term investigation
    of the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its influences on people, their
    communities, and society.” A 100 year study is hard to imagine (and it takes a
    certain chutzpah to announce one!), but thankfully we don’t have to wait 100 years
    for the first results. Every five years, a study panel is convened to assess the
    current state of AI, and what we have here is the first report. It focuses on
    what impact AI will have on life and society (in urban cities) by 2030 – close
    enough in to be imaginable, without straying into science fiction. The report
    runs to 50 pages and is written for an audience that includes the general public.
    As such, it lacks the technical depth that we’re used to on The Morning Paper.
    Nevertheless, I hope the existence of the project and its deliberations will be
    of interest to many of you.

    is that I didn’t find much truly visionary or of the “oh wow, I never thought
    about that” kind here. (YMMV of course!). When I was reflecting on this, maybe
    that’s part of the point – it takes time for innovations to achieve broad societal
    impact and we shouldn’t expect overnight transformations. One of the things hanging
    around the VC industry really reinforces is that timing matters! Or to paraphrase
    Simon Wardley, sometimes you can know what is going to happen, but not when, and
    sometimes you know when something will happen, but not what/how. What *and* when
    is asking a lot! Nevertheless, I do hope that in the next 13-14 years there are
    at least a few breakthroughs that surprise us. Seeing the rate and change of development
    in “AI” that wouldn’t surprise me in the least!

    AI research trends (it really is short, sadly), and then a look by domain at the
    likely impacts in transportation, home/service robots, healthcare, education,
    low-resource communities, public safety and security, employment and workplace,
    and entertainment. By focusing on general life in cities of course, we miss out
    on many other areas ripe for impact by AI (I’m just going to use that term in
    the broadest sense) including manufacturing, agriculture, retail, finance, and
    a whole host of other verticals. The report closes with a section on recommendations
    for AI public policy, which I’m not going to cover.

    Study Panel found no cause for concern that AI is an imminent threat to humankind.
    No machines with self-sustaining long-term goals and intent have been developed,
    nor are they likely to be developed in the near future. Instead, increasingly
    useful applications of AI, with potentially profound positive impacts on our society
    and economy are likely to emerge between now and 2030, the period this report
    considers. At the same time, many of these developments will spur disruptions
    in how human labor is augmented or replaced by AI, creating new challenges for
    the economy and society more broadly.
