    Darley**](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/vincedarley/en): Most of our data looks at
    the attempts players are making in our games’ levels –such as scores, stars, time-stamps,
    whether or not the players succeeded or failed in a level and also what aspect
    made players fail. We also track the help players give to their friends - for
    example sending lives or moves - and finally, any financial transactions.'

- en: One of the great features of our games is that you can play anytime, anywhere
    and on any device. From a data point of view, this can present a challenge in
    that we need to carefully merge together very varied data and identifiers to create
    a clear picture of the individual player. This can be hard because of the data
    volume (10-20 billion events/day), and because the data is (as all big data is!)
    noisy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But getting this right is super important – there’s a big difference between
    someone who has bought a new device to play on (and therefore doesn't play much
    on the old device) vs someone who is losing interest and hardly playing on their
    only device. Secondly, we of course only observe behavior, but for insights to
    be usefully actionable we need to deduce something about the player’s motivation/state-of-mind,
    so that we can take the right action. That is hard!

    common case is about predicting or modeling the long-term customer-lifetime-value
    impact of a game/network feature-change on particular groups of players.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common, but very difficult, case is that of predicting that a player
    is going to stop playing. This is hard because it is only useful if we can predict
    this very early, for example while the player is still playing.

    to manage the rapid growth in data? Any important lessons from this experience?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**VD:** We''ve had to adapt several times over the last 3-4 years. ![hadoop](../Images/fe23fbc9fa3ac2af492d6a6733d8790d.png)The
    first big change came when our games took off on Facebook’s platform and we put
    Hadoop into action to allow us to scale to millions of players. Hadoop has served
    us well through our explosive growth with the tremendous success of our Saga games
    to 100s of millions of players on mobile as a relatively cheap, effective “supertanker”
    for (today) 2 petabytes of compressed data. I say “supertanker” because Hadoop
    is big, solid, but not very nimble.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, over a year ago we added an Exasol system alongside Hadoop – this is a very
    fast, in-memory analytics database – and allows us to do our core processing (the
    ETL for example) much more quickly – reducing nightly processing from 8-12 hours
    down to 1-2\. There are a few key lessons here.

    (149 million daily active users as of Q4 2014) there is no one-size fits all solution
    – hybrid solutions such as our Hadoop/Exasol combination are needed. Secondly,
    we recently let our Hadoop cluster fill up a bit too much, which made it surprisingly
    fragile. Best to leave a decent amount of headroom.'

- en: On the BI side we've used QlikView for our standardized reporting for several
    years and that has generally served us well. At our scale of many ![qlikview](../Images/335d193dcae760559b55afce0efe60b7.png)100s
    of millions of all-time players (of which some 356 million monthly active), building
    reports that allow us to quickly slice’n’dice by cohort, country, game, segment,
    acquisition channel, platform can be problematic. QlikView can sometimes feel
    a bit sluggish, and it isn't very self-aware (i.e. it surprisingly doesn't provide
    much support for monitoring the business user’s experience of report latency,
    load-time, response time, etc). But overall we’re comfortable with its pros/cons
    vs other things on the market right now.

    to avoid/mitigate those problems?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**VD:** Well I could speak for hours about A-B testing, so let’s focus on just
    a few core difficulties. First of all in our industry (free to play games), almost
    all metrics are very skewed/long-tailed – this means small numbers of players
    can easily skew the analysis. Second we’d like our players to have a consistent
    experience across their multiple devices, so that complicates testing. Third,
    sometimes effects/impacts are subtle and so we might need to run an experiment
    for quite a long time to get a conclusive outcome. Fourth, we’d like what we learn
    in one game to be insightful enough that it informs decisions in other games,
    but its much easier to design AB-tests that tell you about a specific game than
    it is to design tests that tell you about the player.'

- en: Recommendations? Employ some good data scientists to deal with the statistical
    subtleties! Decide whether you need to know and precisely quantify “the answer”
    or just be sufficiently confident you can make a sensible decision – that will
    allow you to decide when to run an experiment for a short vs long time. Lastly
    focus on the player and their experience in the experiment design stage, rather
    than just “does feature A or feature B give me better metrics?”.
