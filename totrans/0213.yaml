    boom of the early 90s, many organizations are approaching a new generation of
    technical capabilities, empowering teams and driving digital transformation in
    ways only previously imagined.

- en: While there’s a handful of mature AI-centric companies in the market, most organizations
    seem to be lagging behind. The good news is that with this gap comes an influx
    of online educational opportunities for learning the necessary technical skills
    to build AI solutions. Options range from free educational content on video platforms
    like YouTube to massive open online courses (MOOCs) like Udemy or Coursera, which
    require a monthly fee. There are even long-term online bootcamps designed to help
    individuals change jobs and advance their data & analytics careers.

    roles, most miss the mark in teaching the skills necessary to successfully enable
    and scale AI across a broader organization.

- en: AI education is broken. You may be thinking this claim is pretty bold, especially
    since there are hundreds of free options available for data, analytics and AI
    education online. But when you take a closer look, it becomes obvious that the
    training being offered has a few concerning limitations.

- en: '**Many AI educational tools struggle with learner engagement.** Studies show
    the average completion rate of online analytics and AI education from MOOCs was
    a mere 3 percent.  What makes these courses so dry? They have a one-dimensional
    style. One person, taking one course, to achieve one certification. Some individuals
    learn fine by staring at a screen all day and going through sections, but others
    can find this  tedious or difficult to apply.'

- en: On top of that, without a motivating factor to complete a course and make a
    change in a certain timeframe, the priority to sit down and learn is just not
    there. When leaders expect their students to find the time outside of work, training
    eventually gets deprioritized and teams don’t end up seeing an impact from their
    investment in training.

    is offered by a tool or language vendor, so it centers around specific software
    tools or technical methods. Technical skills, like writing lines of code or setting
    up automations, should not be overlooked. But they’re a single piece of the puzzle
    when it comes to successful AI deployment.'

- en: '**Most AI education is completely off the shelf.** In many cases, thousands
    of students enroll in a single course with a single instructor. Sometimes the
    instructor is only a facilitator, rather than the course creator, and other times
    they are absent altogether. While great for scaling, this teacher-learner relationship
    gap puts the onus on the student to tie the skills they learn back to their job.
    Feedback from students highlights this pain. They report that applying learned
    concepts on the job is one of the most difficult aspects when trying to develop
    a new skill on their own.'

    end up learning a specific tool or tactic in a vacuum. They are missing the real-world
    applicability and collaboration that is critical to building impactful AI solutions
    in line with the organization’s strategy.

    Find courses that are built as a series of short modules for quick accessibility

    One size doesn’t fit all when it comes to learning styles. Pre-recorded videos
    are a common approach today, but it doesn’t work for everybody. Employee students
    should learn a concept and why it’s important, apply it practically in a safe
    environment with team members, then reflect on what works for their specific team
    and environment. This variety in learning modes helps to keep the content fresh,
    engaging, collaborative, and most importantly, applicable.'

    the necessary skills outside of specific tools and lines of code. Technical skills
    are important, yes, but so much more is needed to successfully enable and scale
    AI across your organization.
