- en: Nothing substitutes rigorous formal education, but that's not an option for
    everyone for a whole host of reasons. But learning more about artificial intelligence,
    and the myriad overlapping and related fields and application domains does not
    require a PhD. Getting started can be intimidating, but don't be discouraged;
    check out this [motivating and inspirational post](/2016/09/machine-learning-year-total-noob-effective-practitioner.html),
    the author of which went from little understanding of **machine learning** to
    actively and effectively utilizing techniques in their job within a year.

- en: Looking for an introductory graduate school AI regimen from materials freely
    available online? With more and more institutes of higher learning today making
    the decision to allow course materials to be openly accessible to non-students
    via the magic of the web, all of a sudden a pseudo-university course experience
    can be had by almost anyone, anywhere. Have a look at the following free course
    materials, all of which are appropriate for an introductory level of AI understanding,
    some of which also cover niche application concepts and material.

    in shaping the minds of top AI researchers and practitioners in the world. There
    is no reason you cannot benefit from this same material and instruction on your

    much of this course material several years ago myself, you can undoubtedly gain
    a competent overview of foundational AI topics here, including both theory and
    practice.

    would provide a substantial introductory artificial intelligence education. Also,
    given that at least a few of the texts used in the Stanford course are (legitimately)
    freely available online, a near-immersive experience is possible.
