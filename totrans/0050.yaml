- en: Data Governance and AI fatigue sound like two different concepts, but there
    is an intrinsic connection between the two. To understand it better, let’s start
    with their definition.

    – “Data governance is everything you do to ensure data is secure, private, accurate,
    available, and usable. It involves setting internal standards—data policies—that
    apply to how data is gathered, stored, processed, and disposed of.”'

    the engine driving AI models.

    to emerge, let’s relate it to AI fatigue. Though the name gives it away, highlighting
    the reasons leading to such fatigue ensures consistent use of this term throughout
    the post.

    or teams face, often leading to unsuccessful value realization or implementation
    of AI systems.

    sophisticated technologies such as AI, key stakeholders need to align with not
    just the capabilities and possibilities of AI but also its limitations and risks.

- en: Once we have evaluated that the problem can be best solved using ML algorithms,
    the data science team performs an exploratory data analysis. Many underlying data
    patterns are uncovered at this stage, highlighting whether the given data is rich
    in the signal. It also helps create engineered features to speed up the learning
    process of the algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, the team builds the first baseline model, often, finding that it is not
    performing up to the acceptable level. A model whose output is as good as a coin
    flip adds no value. This is one of the first setbacks, aka lessons, while building
    ML models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Organizations may move from one business problem to another, causing fatigue.
    Still, if the underlying data does not carry a rich signal, no AI algorithm can
    build upon it. The model must learn the statistical associations from the training
    data to generalize on unseen data.

    line with the qualifying business criteria, such as 70% precision, fatigue can
    still arise if the model fails to perform adequately in the production environment.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Myriad reasons could lead to deteriorated performance, where poor data quality
    is the most common issue plaguing the model. It limits the model’s ability to
    accurately predict the target response in the absence of crucial attributes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider when one of the essential features, which was only 10% missing in training
    data, now becomes null 50% of the time in the production data, leading to erroneous
    predictions. Such iterations and efforts to ensure consistently performing models
    build fatigue in the data scientists and business teams, thereby eroding confidence
    in the data pipelines and risking the investments made into the project.

    Given that the data is at the core of ML models, signal-rich, error-free, and
    high-quality data are a must for the success of an ML project. Addressing AI fatigue
    requires a strong focus on data governance. So, we must work rigorously to ensure
    the right data quality, laying the groundwork to build state-of-the-art models
    and deliver trustworthy business insights.

- en: Data quality, the key to thriving data governance, is a critical success factor
    for machine learning algorithms. Organizations must invest in data quality, such
    as publishing reports to the data consumers. In data science projects, think of
    what happens when the bad quality data makes its way to the models, which can
    lead to poor performance.
  prefs: []

    concerns, which, when sent to be fixed upstream, end up causing fatigue among
    the teams.

    the right data starts to pipe in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, it is always advised to fix data issues at source to prevent such time-consuming
    iterations. Eventually, the published data quality reports allude to the data
    science team (or, for that matter, any other downstream users and data consumers)
    with an understanding of the acceptable quality of the incoming data.

    with data issues, contributing to unsuccessful models driving AI fatigue.
