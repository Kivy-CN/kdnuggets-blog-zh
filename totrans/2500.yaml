- en: Brain-Computer Interfaces have become one of the most promising technologies
    for assisting people who have lost their motor control due to stroke, spinal cord
    injury, paralysis, or ALS, to communicate and perform actions that were not feasible
    earlier. Using this technology, they can now type, walk and grasp things just
    by imagining writing the same using their own hands. Leveraging this technology,
    we present here our Neural Website, which we presented as part of AllenNLP Hacks
    2021\. In this project, we used BCI and NLP techniques to enable people who have
    lost their motor control to create websites on their own just by imagining to
    write the instructions.

- en: The first part of the project consists of converting the neural signals associated
    with handwriting into text in real-time. Researchers at Stanford University implemented
    this using the recorded neural signals from the hand “knob” area of the participant’s
    left-hemisphere (dominant) precentral gyrus implanted with intracortical array
    electrodes.

    average number of times per second that the neural signal crosses a certain threshold) 
    were used as neural features. These neural features were fed into a Recurrent
    Neural Network model, which converts the neural time-series signal into probability
    time series. The probabilities, in turn, tell us about new character beginnings
    and the likelihood of the subsequent characters. (as shown in the figure below)
    In the online mode, the raw output gives each character when its probability crosses
    the threshold. In the offline mode, the character probabilities are combined with
    a large-vocabulary language model to decode the most likely sentence.

    more than the previous typing record using cursor movements.  The word error rate
    is 5.4% in the online mode, while using language models in the offline mode gave
    a word error rate of 3.4%.

    the website, we created synthetic neural signal data that can be used to demonstrate
    our project. (The same technique that is used for data augmentation during training
    in the original study.)

    Processing to clean and process the text to decipher the participant’s instructions
    on the website. We cleaned the decoded text using autocorrect techniques similar
    to those used in speech recognition, like the bigram model to get the candidate
    sentences and a language model to rescore the outputs. For extracting the relevant
    information from the cleanup text, we used NLP techniques. This technique classifies
    the intent and entities in the text that the participant wrote.

- en: To find the intent, i.e, the action the user wants to take, we first define
    a set of known intents that can be used to search for similar intent in a new
    sentence. We converted these raw text examples into sentence embeddings using
    the BERT model to get the vector representations of each example sentence. For
    new sentences, we used the same trained model to get the corresponding embeddings.
    To find the sentence most similar to the text entered, we used FAISS (Facebook
    AI Similarity Search) library’s IndexFlatIP algorithm, which uses the inner product
    between the vectors to find their similarity.

- en: On obtaining the intent, we need to find the entity or slot in the sentence.
    Entities can be fields, data, or text descriptions (in our case, it is HTML elements).
    We used ELMo model to obtain the contextual word embeddings. Contextual word embeddings
    contain information about the individual word and the contextual meaning of its
    usage in the sentence. For example, in the sentence “I left my phone on the left
    side of the room” the word “left” can have different meanings according to its
    occurrence in the sentence.

- en: We also defined some entities to look for in the sentence like image entity,
    position entity, etc. The various entities in the sentence were decoded using
    the similarity search algorithm. The model also gives the value of the entity
    decoded. We used BIO (Beginning Inside Outside) Tagging, (a common tagging format
    for tagging tokens) to get multi-word entities.

    website after collecting and processing all the relevant information from the
    raw input given by the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the extracted intent and entities are used to update the user interface.
    An intent represents action to take (add, remove, change, increase). Entities
    represent elements (title, image, border) and properties (size, color, style,
    position, image description). Like from the above example, the website builder
    will search for images of elephants in the image search API (In This case, pixabay
    API) and add the top result as the background image to the current view. If the
    user doesn't like it, they can input the next image/ change image, etc. Then the
    background will be replaced by the second top result. Similarly, users can continue
    with more such commands like next section/ add a slide and keep adding content
    to enhance and customize the page to their liking. Finally, they can save, host,
    and share their creation as a link.
