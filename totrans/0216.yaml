    has left the pages of science fiction novels and become one of the cornerstone
    technologies of modern-day society. Success in machine learning (ML) has led to
    a torrent of new AI applications that are almost too numerous to count, from autonomous
    machines and biometrics to predictive analytics and chatbots.

- en: One emerging application of AI in recent years has been conversational intelligence
    (CI). While automated chatbots and virtual assistants are concerned with human-to-computer
    interaction, CI aims to explore human-to-human interaction in greater detail.
    The potential to monitor and extract data from human conversations, including
    tone, [sentiment](https://symbl.ai/blog/sentiment-analysis/) and context, has
    seemingly limitless potential.

  zh: 近年来，人工智能的一个新兴应用是对话智能（CI）。虽然自动聊天机器人和虚拟助手关注的是人机互动，但CI旨在更详细地探索人际互动。从人类对话中监测和提取数据，包括语气、[情感](https://symbl.ai/blog/sentiment-analysis/)和背景，其潜力似乎是无限的。
- en: For instance, data from call center interactions could be generated and logged,
    with everything from speaker ratio and customer satisfaction to call summaries
    and points of action being automatically filed. This would dramatically cut down
    the bureaucracy involved in call center handling and give agents more time to
    speak with customers. What’s more, the data generated could even be used to shape
    staff training programs, and even recognize and reward outstanding work.

    is for individual businesses. But despite our increasing dependence on AI as a
    technology, we know precious little about what goes on under the hood. As data
    volume increases, and the paths taken by AI to make a determination become more
    elaborate, we as humans have lost the ability to comprehend and retrace those

- en: It begs the question; how can we trust AI-based decisions if we can’t understand
    *how* those decisions are made? It’s an increasing source of frustration for businesses
    that want to ensure their systems are working correctly, meeting the correct regulatory
    standards, or that they’re operating at maximum efficiency. Consider the recruitment
    team at Amazon, who had to [scrap their secret AI recruiting tool](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G)
    after they realized it was showing bias against women. They thought they had the
    “holy grail” of recruiting – a tool that could scan hundreds of resumes and pick
    out the top several for review, saving them countless hours of work. Through repetition
    and reinforcement, the AI managed to convince itself that male candidates were
    somehow preferable to female ones. Had the team trusted blindly in the AI – which
    they did for a very short period – the consequences for the company would have
    been devastating.

    one thing to use natural language processing (NLP) to create chatbots or transcribe
    speech-to-text, but it’s another entirely to derive meaning and understanding
    out of conversations. That’s what conversation intelligence (CI) does. It goes

  zh: 人际互动的世界多年来一直是AI创新的热土。使用自然语言处理（NLP）创建聊天机器人或将语音转录为文本是一回事，但从对话中得出意义和理解则完全是另一回事。这就是对话智能（CI）所做的。它超越了确定性的“A到B”结果，旨在分析对话中不那么明确的方面，如语调、情感和意义。
- en: If CI is employed in a call center, for instance, it might be used to determine
    the effectiveness of the call handler, the emotional state of the customer, or
    provide an automatic call summary with action points. These are sophisticated
    and subjective interactions that don’t necessarily have right or wrong interpretations.
    If a call center is going to use CI to streamline interactions, train agents and
    update customer records, it needs to have confidence that the underlying AI is
    doing its job effectively. That’s where explainable AI or “XAI” comes into play.

- en: Every business is different, and has a different definition of what the system
    is supposed to learn and predict using their conversation intelligence stack.
    And it’s essential that the solution provides a complete view of the predictions
    respective to the human actors using the system, so that they can continuously
    approve or disapprove the predictions made by the system. Instead of adopting
    a black boxed deep learning based system to perform tasks, a modularized system
    where there's full transparency and control on each aspect of the predictions
    of the system is critical. For example, a deterministic programmable system can
    be used to use separate systems for tracking sentiment of a call, finding topics,
    generating summary, detecting specific aspects such as type of issue in a support
    call, or requests in customer feedback calls, etc. instead of a singular deep
    learning system doing all these things. By creating such a modular architecture,
    the overall conversation intelligence solution is built to be traceable and deterministic.
