- en: Nowadays, AI state-of-the-art techniques includes, among other things, [comparing
    multiple machine learning models](/2019/10/choosing-machine-learning-model.html)
    within one tool/library. However, it’s still very common to [try different techniques
    manually](https://machinelearningmastery.com/compare-the-performance-of-machine-learning-algorithms-in-r/),
    which – when done over and over – is both boring and prone to mistakes. Diminishing
    risk of failures gets even more important when having large amounts of code, as
    debugging and testing gets laborious. With this in mind, AI-JACK was created.
    It’s a machine learning pipeline accelerator, designed as R library to solve problems
    quicker and better.

- en: AI-JACK is written [as a library in R](https://github.com/Bilot/AI-JACK-opensource-R),
    although **it doesn’t require any coding** from the user unless they want to add
    custom features. It contains multiple functions built in to help in going through
    the whole pipeline. There are modules for data loading, preprocessing, model training
    and versioning, as well as deployment, and **all of those can be controlled with
    just few parameters** within one configuration file. The modelling is done mostly
    using H2O API, a state-of-the-art ML framework, with many algorithms available,
    such as XGBoost, random forests, linear models, deep learning, EM clustering,
    isolation forests and more.

    can add other functions or models on top of AI-JACK. This is the strength of the
    tool: it can serve both as a full pipeline in many kinds of problems or can be
    just a step within a bigger process.'

    the best one according to selected metric and then saves its output – metadata,
    validation results, feature importance and the model itself – to given path. Results
    can also be in a form of web service, where you could access them via API.

- en: In order to work, you need to have R runtime installed. RStudio will also be
    handy as an IDE with most-used text editor to write R code, although as AI-JACK
    in its basic version doesn’t require coding, a simple notebook can be enough.

- en: 'Your dataset should generally be pre-processed prior to using AI-JACK. The
    library supports only minor techniques: removing special characters, missing values,
    splitting into test/train/validation sets. It might be loaded either as a local
    csv file or connected to SQL database. Then all you need to do is to initialize
    your project in selected path with function `init_aijack` and specify parameters
    in newly-created configuration file – `config_model.R` or `config_clust_model.R`,
    depending if you wish to use supervised or unsupervised ML. After saving the config
    file, run `main_model.R` or `main_clust_model.R` and several models will be trained.
    All needed files are saved automatically to selected path.'

- en: If you are training a supervised model, csv outputs include information about
    feature importance over all techniques, as well as validation results, names of
    columns created (if, for example, the model used dummy variables), accuracy score
    of each execution, possible errors and metadata about the model.

- en: If you’re using clustering, AI-JACK automatically trains three techniques and
    saves png charts comparing those models according to silhouette score. The techniques
    are k-means, k-medoids and expectation-maximization, most-used ones among unsupervised
    techniques.

    page. AI-JACK is an open-source project, thus contributions are welcome! If you
    find the library useful and want to help and developing it, you are free to do
    so.
