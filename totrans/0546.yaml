    industries. As a result, corporations and organizations are trying to make the
    most out of the data they already have and determine what data they still need
    to capture and store. In addition, there continues to be an incredible need for
    data scientists to make sense of the numbers and uncover hidden solutions to messy
    business problems. A [recent study](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/top-10-tech-skills-in-2020-worldwide-ecef27c8d8ad) using
    the LinkedIn job search tool shows that a majority of top tech jobs in the year
    2020 are jobs that require skills in data science.

    preparation and exploration, data representation and transformation, data visualization
    and presentation, predictive analytics, machine learning, deep learning, artificial
    intelligence, etc. It is possible to consider three levels of data science competency
    (*3 levels defined based on topics covered in one of the best machine learning
    textbooks out there: Python Machine Learning by Sebastien Raschka, 3^(rd) Edition*),
    namely: **level 1** (basic level); **level 2** (intermediate level); and l**evel
    3** (advanced level). Competency increases from level 1 to 3, as shown in **Figure
    1** below.'

    that can drive decision making in an institution or organization. Their job role
    includes data collection, data transformation, data visualization and analysis,
    building predictive models, providing recommendations on actions to implement
    based on data findings. Data scientists work in different sectors such as healthcare,

    to start from somewhere. Do not be overwhelmed by the[ ridiculous list of programming
    languages mentioned in data scientist job ads](https://towardsdatascience.com/ridiculous-requirements-from-data-scientist-job-ads-d84fa716af73).
    While it is important to learn as many data science tools as possible, it is recommended
    to start with just one or two programming languages for a start. Then once you
    have built a solid background in data science, you can then challenge yourself
    to learn about different programming languages or different platforms and productivity
    tools that can enhance your skillset. According to this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-and-r-unequivocal-champions-of-data-science-31ab4d1fa45e),
    Python and R are still the top two programming languages used in data science.
    I would recommend starting with Python as more and more academic training programs
    and industries are using it as the default language for data science.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a solid background in an analytical discipline, such as **physics**, **mathematics**, **engineering**, **computer
    science**, **economics**, or **statistics**, you can basically teach yourself
    the basics of data science. You may start by taking free online courses from platforms
    like edX, Coursera, or DataCamp. **Level 1** competency (see **Figure 1**) can
    be achieved within 6 to 12 months. **Level 2** competencies can be achieved within
    7 to 18 months. **Level 3** competencies can be achieved within 18 to 48 months.
    The amount of time required to gain a certain level of competence depends on your
    background and how much time you are willing to invest in your data science studies.
    Typically, individuals with a background in an analytic discipline such as physics,
    mathematics, science, engineering, accounting, or computer science would require
    less time compared to individuals with backgrounds not complementary to data science.

    to model building and application, the process could take weeks and even months,
    depending on the scale of the problem. As a practicing data scientist, hitting
    a roadblock with a project is something inevitable. Patience, tenacity, and perseverance are
    key qualities essential for a successful data science career.

- en: Data science is a very practical field. Remember that you may be very good at
    handling data as well as building good machine learning algorithms, but as a data
    scientist, the real-world application is all that matters. Every predictive model must
    produce meaningful and interpretable results in real-life situations. A predictive
    model must be validated against reality in order to be considered meaningful and
    useful. Your role as a data scientist is to draw out meaningful insights from
    data that can be used for data-driven decisions that can improve the efficiency
    of your company or improve the way business is conducted, or help increase profits.

    of the team or with business administrators in their organizations. Good communication
    skills would play a key role here to be able to convey and present very technical
    information to people with little or no understanding of technical concepts in
    data science. Good communication skills will help foster an atmosphere of unity
    and togetherness with other team members such as data analysts, data engineers,

    is to network with other data scientists. Some platforms that promote networking
    are LinkedIn, GitHub, and medium ([Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) and [Towards
    AI](https://towardsai.net/) publications). The platforms are very useful for up-to-date

    too, especially during early project development phases where you need to rely
    on engineers or other personnel to be able to design and frame a good data science
    project. Being a good team player world helps you to thrive in a business environment

    the implication of your project. Be truthful to yourself. Avoid manipulating data
    or using a method that will intentionally produce bias in results. Be ethical
    in all phases, from data collection and analysis to model building, analysis,
    testing, and application. Avoid fabricating results for the purpose of misleading
    or manipulating your audience. Be ethical in the way you interpret the findings
    from your data science project.

    your circumstances allow you to do that. If you cannot afford a master’s degree
    program, you may pursue the self-study route for learning about data science.
    Generally, if you have a solid background in an analytic discipline such as physics,
    mathematics, economics, engineering, or computer science, and you are interested
    in exploring the field of data science, the best way is to begin with massive
    open online courses (MOOCs). Then after establishing a solid foundation, you may
    then seek other ways to increase your knowledge and expertise, such as studying
    from textbooks, engaging in projects, and networking with other data science aspirants.
