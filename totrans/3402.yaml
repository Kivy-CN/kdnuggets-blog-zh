    is data science?’, is ‘How do I learn data science?’. It’s not just a question
    that comes from those who are new to data science, but also from those who have
    already been around for some time. The road to the “sexiest job of the 21st Century”
    or the “best job of the year” 2016 is clearly not as smooth or straightforward
    as one would think.

    doing. But we have also noticed that they continue to ask these questions. You
    can find a lot of opinions and advice from seasoned veterans on the Internet,
    but this jungle of information is not making things easier for beginners. This
    post is meant to present a general overview of the eight steps that you need to
    go through to learn data science.

    for everyone that is interested in learning data science or for everyone that
    has already become a data scientist or part of a data science team but wants some
    additional resources for further perfection.

    or attempts at definitions around, and it doesn’t need to surprise that some of
    these have been visually represented. The most significant start of this trend
    or tradition was in 2010, when Drew Conway [presented a Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram)
    to define the concept “data science”. In the center of the picture is data science
    and it is the result of the combination of hacking skills, mathematics and statistics
    knowledge and substantive expertise.

    that circulated throughout the data science industry, one more successful than
    the other. For a chronological overview of the most significant ones, check out

    data science is. Matthew Mayo [blogged](/2016/03/data-science-puzzle-explained.html)
    a visual representation made by Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro. There are a lot of
    things that are different. Two things that stand out are the fact that data science
    is no longer in the center of the picture and that the approach to defining data
    science is different. Data science is now defined through its relation to other
    disciplines, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep
    Learning, Big Data (BD) and Data Mining (DM). Data science is at the crossing
    of AI, ML and BD and has an intrinsic relation with DM, as it is considered the
    superset of data mining and its successor term.

    of similarities: the disciplines that are visualized in Piatetsky-Shapiro’s picture
    all require hacking skills, mathematics and statistics knowledge and substantive
    expertise or domain knowledge.'

    background of data scientists. As a result, there have also been many different
    results. In the [O’Reilly Data Science Salary Survey of 2014](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/2014-data-science-salary-survey.pdf),
    about 28% of the respondents had a Bachelor’s degree, while 44% had a Master’s
    degree and 20% had a Ph.D. Common fields that data scientists have as backgrounds
    are mathematics/Statistics, Computer Sciences, and Engineering. The results that
    are represented in the infographic are from [2016](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/2016-data-science-salary-survey.csp).
    They are very similar to the ones of the O’Reilly survey.

    to become a data scientist is usually a Master’s degree or Ph.D. The field that
    you come from is of less importance, but you have an advantage if you have a quantitative
    background.

    years, but data science has remained a somewhat technical occupation. A sound
    knowledge of statistics, mathematics, and machine learning are still considered

    online courses on a variety of mathematics topics that will undoubtedly be of
    great value to you, but make sure to also take a look at the Linear Algebra course

    [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) and [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/)’s
    material might help you, and for Machine Learning, you should keep an eye out
