    They are called "[The Penguin Café Orchestra](https://www.penguincafe.com/)" and
    if you don't know them you are going to find out what they are about.

- en: First let's see what comes out from the reviews just analysing the words used
    in them. We'll firstly concatenate all the reviews in one variable, in order to
    have a whole artist's review. Then we are going to take a look at the most frequent
    words in them, hoping that it will reveal more on the Penguin Café Orchestra.

- en: Using a shallow-linguistics approach we can investigate the artist review, which
    contains all the available reviews. To do so we use matplotlib and word cloud
    to produce a word cloud that will tell us more about the most frequent words in
    the text.

    know that they use instruments such as the ukulele, piano and violin, and that
    they mix genres such as folk, ethnic, and classic.

    at what emotions come out of their work.

- en: To do so, we are going to use expert.ai’s NL API. Please register [here](https://developer.expert.ai/ui?utm_medium=placement&utm_source=kdnuggets&utm_campaign=blog),
    find the documentation on the SDK [here](https://github.com/therealexpertai/nlapi-python)

    The sum of all the frequencies is 100\. This makes the frequencies of the emotions
    a good candidate for a pie chart, that is plotted using matplotlib.

    that Scaruffis found in their work, where could you start? We can take a look
    at the sentiment analysis for each album and get an idea of their best ones. To
    do so, we iterate on each album's review and use expert.ai NL API to retrieve
    their sentiment and its strength.

    will give us quick visual feedback on the best album of The Penguin Cafe Orchestra,
    and on their career. To do so we use once again matplotlib.
