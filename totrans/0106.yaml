    GPT-3, and GPT-4\. But also surrounding the ethical concerns of AI systems like
    ChatGPT to the socioeconomics of today's world.

    Many people are concerned with superintelligence, an AI system that is so intelligent
    that it surpasses human minds. Some believe that technology could solve a lot
    of the world's current problems, however with very little information or understanding
    around it - it is difficult to weigh the pros against the cons.

    but it is definitely a conversation that needs to be had. The best approach to
    take is to manage these potential risks earlier on before they become a bigger
    problem that cannot be handled.

    AI, however, it is something that they are working on with their new team Superalignment.
    They are currently using techniques such as [reinforcement learning from human
    feedback](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following), which heavily relies
    on humans to supervise AI. However, there are concerns about the future challenges
    of humans not being able to reliably supervise AI and the need for new scientific
    breakthroughs to handle this.

- en: With that being said, OpenAI is looking at building a human-level automated
    alignment researcher that will be able to learn from human feedback and assist
    humans in evaluating AI, as well as being able to solve other alignment problems.
    OpenAI has dedicated 20% of the compute that they have secured to date to this
    effort, to iteratively align superintelligence.
