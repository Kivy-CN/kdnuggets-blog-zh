- en: SVM is one of the most popular off-the-shelf modeling algorithms and one of
    its most powerful features is the ability to fit the model with different kernels.
    SVM kernels can be thought of as a way to automatically combine existing features
    to form a richer feature space. Since this power feature comes almost for free,
    most practitioners by default use kernel when training a SVM model. However, when
    the data has n<<p (number of samples << number of features) -- common in industries
    like medical data -- the richer feature space implies a much higher risk to overfit
    the data. In fact, high variance models should be avoided entirely when n<<p.

- en: Applying L1 or L2 to penalize large coefficients is a common way to regularize
    linear or logistic regression. However, many practitioners are not aware of the
    importance of standardizing features before applying those regularization.

- en: Returning to fraud detection, imagine a linear regression model with a transaction
    amount feature. Without regularization, if the unit of transaction amount is in
    dollars, the fitted coefficient is going to be around 100 times larger than the
    fitted coefficient if the unit were in cents. With regularization, as the L1 /
    L2 penalize larger coefficient more, the transaction amount will get penalized
    more if the unit is in dollars. Hence, the regularization is biased and tend to
    penalize features in smaller scales. To mitigate the problem, standardize all
    the features and put them on equal footing as a preprocessing step.

- en: Imagine building a linear model with two variables X1 and X2 and suppose the
    ground truth model is Y=X1+X2\. Ideally, if the data is observed with small amount
    of noise, the linear regression solution would recover the ground truth. However,
    if X1 and X2 are collinear, to most of the optimization algorithms' concerns,
    Y=2*X1, Y=3*X1-X2 or Y=100*X1-99*X2 are all as good. The problem might not be
    detrimental as it doesn't bias the estimation. However, it does make the problem
    ill-conditioned and make the coefficient weight uninterpretable.

    as feature importance**'
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because many off-the-shelf linear regressor returns p-value for each coefficient,
    many practitioners believe that for linear models, the bigger the absolute value
    of the coefficient, the more important the corresponding feature is. This is rarely
    true as (a) changing the scale of the variable changes the absolute value of the
    coefficient (b) if features are multi-collinear, coefficients can shift from one
    feature to others. Also, the more features the data set has, the more likely the
    features are multi-collinear and the less reliable to interpret the feature importance
    by coefficients.
