- en: Traditionally, computers used to follow an explicit set of instructions. For
    instance, if you wanted the computer to perform a simple task of adding two numbers,
    you had to spell out every step. However, as our data became more complex, this
    manual approach of giving instructions for each situation became inadequate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where Machine Learning emerged as a game changer. We wanted computers
    to learn from examples just like we learn from our experiences. Imagine teaching
    a child how to ride a bicycle by showing it a few times and then letting him fall,
    figure it out, and learn on his own. That's the idea behind Machine Learning.
    This innovation has not only transformed industries but has become an indispensable
    necessity in today's world.

    we must obviously have an existing understanding of the underlying concepts of
    machine learning, as Scikit-learn is nothing more than a practical tool for implementing
    machine learning principles and related tasks. Machine learning is a subset of
    artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience
    without being explicitly programmed. The algorithms use training data to make
    predictions or decisions by uncovering patterns and insights.

- en: Supervised is a subcategory of machine learning in which the computer learns
    from the labelled dataset containing both the input as well as the correct output.
    It tries to find the mapping function that relates the input (x) to the output
    (y). You can think of it as teaching your younger brother or sister how to recognize
    different animals. You will show them some pictures (x) and tell them what each
    animal is called (y).

    the new picture correctly. This is the basic intuition behind supervised learning.

- en: Linear regression is the fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm for
    predicting the continuous target variables based on the input features. As the
    name suggests it assumes that the relationship between the dependant and independent
    variable is linear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if we try to plot the dependent variable Y against the independent variable
    X, we will obtain a straight line.

- en: In machine learning, unsupervised learning is a paradigm that involves training
    an algorithm on an unlabeled dataset. So there’s no supervision or labeled outputs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In unsupervised learning, the goal is to discover patterns, structures, or relationships
    within the data itself, rather than predicting or classifying based on labelled
    examples. It involves exploring the inherent structure of the data to gain insights
    and make sense of complex information.

    in data science. It is used to automatically segment datasets into clusters or
    groups based on similarities between data points.

    and apply it to real data using scikit-learn. Additionally, we will visualize
    the results to understand the data distribution.

    challenging. It needs to be evaluated to understand if the model is enough good
    or needs some modifications to improve the performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the model doesn’t learn enough of the patterns from the training set, it
    will perform badly on both training and test sets. This is the so-called underfitting
    problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning too much about the patterns of training data, even the noise, will
    lead the model to perform very well on the training set, but it will work poorly
    on the test set. This situation is overfitting. The generalization of the model
    can be obtained if the performances measured both in training and test sets are
    similar.
