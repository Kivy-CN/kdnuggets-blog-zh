    or guesswork, and make a decision about a prospect change on the website. You
    can just “not think” and “know it all” unless data-driven metrics point you to
    making the move. Hence, a lot of organizations use a statistical technique known
    as the A/B test to check beforehand whether the change will yield any good to
    the business or not.

    two versions of a single [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics))
    (product or website), typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against
    variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective or performs
    better. Whether you're a marketer, product manager, or data analyst, understanding
    A/B testing is essential for making data-driven decisions.
