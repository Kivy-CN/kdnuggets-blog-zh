    of the workforce is expected to upskill. This is natural to keep up with the continuous
    growth in technology, specifically generative AI.

    will need to reskill due to AI and automation. However, it also states that analytical
    skills with business acumen and a bunch of soft skills will be highly desirable
    in the next 3 years.

    more than one benefit from them. For example, this employee is very proficient
    in data wrangling, however, they are amazing at creating data visualizations for
    our board meetings.

    a lot of data out there, and with the rise of BigData and its use for generative
    AI, organizations are going to want to make use of it. Data cleaning and wrangling
    consist of transforming raw data into a format that can be later used for analysis.

    data, it’s not always true. It is a time-consuming task, however, it doesn’t take
    up to 80% of a data scientist's time - all the time.

    2023\. Why’s that? Because data seldom comes nice and clean. Especially now with
    organizations skimming through old data that has collected dust and are trying
    to find ways that they can use it. Get your dustpan and brush out, because there’s
    definitely some cleaning to do.

    executives in the next 3 years will be looking out for. According to the IBM report,
    at the top of executives' list is to upskill employees in a variety of soft skills
    such as time management, and communication. After this comes analytics skills
    with business acumen.

    science and allows you to explore data through descriptive statistics, understand
    your data better and represent it through visualizations. They work hand-in-hand
    with elements in the data cleaning and wrangling phase such as missing values
    and addressing anomalies.

    do something that generative AI tools aren’t able to achieve right now. Technology
    can help us automate tasks and we can use data analysis to see what is working,
    and what isn’t.

    team environment in an agile and flexible manner - all those insights go down
    the drain. The employees are the drivers of the innovation, the generative AI
    systems are tools that will aid us.
