- en: Sometimes you know the best fitting distribution, or probability density function,
    of your data prior to analysis; more often, you do not. Approaches to data sampling,
    modeling, and analysis can vary based on the distribution of your data, and so
    determining the best fit theoretical distribution can be an essential step in
    your data exploration process.

- en: '`distfit` is a python package for probability density fitting across 89 univariate
    distributions to non-censored data by residual sum of squares (RSS), and hypothesis
    testing. Probability density fitting is the fitting of a probability distribution
    to a series of data concerning the repeated measurement of a variable phenomenon.
    `distfit` scores each of the 89 different distributions for the fit with the empirical
    distribution and return the best scoring distribution.'

- en: Essentially, we can pass our data to distfit and have it determine which probability
    distribution the data best fits, based on an RSS metric, after it attempts to
    fit the data to 89 different distributions. We can then view a visualization overlay
    of the empirical data and the best fit distribution. We can also view a summary
    of the process, as well as plot the best-fit results.

    how simple it is to use.

    data to the model. This is the core of the distfit distribution fitting process.

    that the lowest RSS will provide the best fit, our data best fits the normal distribution.

- en: This may seem like a foregone conclusion, given that we sampled from the normal
    distribution, but that is not the case. Given the similarity between numerous
    distributions, consecutive runs on resampled data using the normal distribution
    show it is just as easy (perhaps easier?) to end up with a best fit distribution
    of t, gamma, beta, log-normal, or log-gamma, to name but a few, especially on
    relatively low sample sizes.

    data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `distfit` function has many use-cases. First of all to determine the best
    theoretical distribution for your data. This can reduce tens-of-thousands of data
    points into 3 floating parameters. Another application is for outlier detection.
    A null-distribution can be determined using the normal state. New datapoints that
    deviate significantly can then be marked as outliers, and are potentially of interest.
    The null-distribution can also be generated by randomization/permutation approaches.
    In such case, the new datapoints will be marked if it significantly deviates from
    randomness.
