- en: When I started learning Python, my entire focus was on learning data science
    instead of the software engineering side of the programming language. I missed
    a lot of core concepts of the language that could have helped me write clean and
    reproducible code.

- en: I am not alone in this journey. Some of my colleagues and other data scientists
    have similar issues where they just want to solve a data science problem with
    poorly written code. The code is unreadable, chunky, and harder to reproduce and
    maintain. Instead of using an object-oriented approach, most data professionals
    use functional programming, which is adequate for experimentation but not for
    production. Some of us don’t even know what chaining comparison operators are,
    walrus operator, repr, sequence indexing, slicing, and pattern matching.

- en: These bad coding practices cause delays and conflicts as it is hard to understand
    and optimize existing code. So, I started learning Python for software engineers.
    I took multiple courses and read books on mastering Python. These resources have
    helped me understand object-oriented programing, coding style, clean and reproducible
    code, refactoring, and test-driven development. This was not it. I wanted to learn
    more. I wanted to learn how to write elegant, compelling, and expressive code.
    This is where I found a free book called [Pydon'ts](https://mathspp.gumroad.com/l/pydonts),
    which helped me understand what I was missing in my coding practice.

- en: '[Pydon''ts](https://mathspp.gumroad.com/l/pydonts) is totally free and has
    330+ pages of pure knowledge. This book is for all professionals and enthusiasts
    who want to get better at writing elegant and production-ready code. Especially
    data scientists who are still writing code that is only understood by them. The
    book consists of 20 chapters that will teach you about Python built-ins and their
    various usage patterns. Each chapter contains an introduction, various usage patterns
    of a single function, coding examples, conclusions, and references. In short,
    every chapter is like a short blog explaining each concept in detail with a real
    project example.'

    Python for seven and half years, and he has a blog [Mathspp Blog](https://mathspp.com/blog/tag:python),
    that covers interesting concepts of mathematics and programming language. He is
    highly respected in the Python community, and his vision is to teach people free
    of cost about the best practices of the Python language. Python is a rich language,
    and every chapter in this book explores a single feature in detail, accompanied
    by code examples covering all the angles.

- en: Python is popular among data professionals. We are using it to do statistical
    experiments, data analysis, data management, business intelligence, and machine
    learning. But, we don't know all of the built-in functions that can help us write
    elegant and effective programs. We just have a basic understanding of language,
    and with trial and error, we produce solutions. This kind of practice is limited
    to experimentation, and it will fail in the production environment.
