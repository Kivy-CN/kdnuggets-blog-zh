- en: With the world immersed in data from disparate sources, every time you click
    your mouse to purchase something, the information trail (data ) is captured and
    stored which is used in future by retailers to attract you to make more purchases.
    For example, if you are a customer looking to buy a new phone, mobile websites
    or apps have information of what products you viewed, Google has information about
    what products you searched for and GSMArena (a popular smartphone reviews website)
    knows what mobile phone reviews you read.  You also happened to share these reviews
    via tweets or Facebook updates. All the millions of Tweets, Facebook likes, Instagram
    and Pinterest Photos can be organized in a manner to help e-commerce businesses
    discover what customers want and when they want it. Collecting, storing, sorting
    and analysing data to draw meaningful and productive insights is an integral part
    of data science and this comparatively new kind of job in the field of data science
    is fulfilled by experts known as [“Data Scientists”](http://www.dezyre.com/article/data-scientist-skills-must-have-s/134
    "What skills are required to become a Data Scientist").

    follow similar patterns. The “Big Data Revolution” has brought technological advancements
    in data storage, cloud computing and [data science](http://www.dezyre.com/article/-data-science-hottest-technology-trend-of-2015/164
    "What is Data Science") which helps businesses identify these similar patterns.
    Today, data science algorithms can predict everything from flu outbreaks to mortality
    to crimes.

    they have been doing great business due to the quality of their product and on-time
    deliveries. As the global trend shifts and competition grows, there is a need
    for ecological products. This slowly shifts company’s perfect customers to their
    competitors – which probably will go unnoticed by the company if they manually
    examine the market. Such small shifts can be identified by data scientists who
    write algorithms to continuously monitor the bygone sales cycles of the company
    by cross referencing the sales with external sources like news articles, social
    media updates – discussing these trends that help find correlations with the inclination
    to buy the products. Data science helps retailers discover new ways to understand
    how to retain their “core” customers rather than merely acquiring new customers.

    zettabytes by end of 2020 that is close to 5,200 GB for every woman, man and child
    on earth. The amount of digital data produced is expected to double every year.
    As the saying goes “Data is the new gold”! Competition among e-commerce businesses
    is faster and fiercer. Customer habits change with the blink of an eye and every
    e-commerce business wants to win over that extra edge when it comes to fulfilling
    customer demands. Common sense, intuition and gut feelings are useful but definitely
    not enough to make predictions. Data science algorithms help businesses understand
    products, services, processes and customers effectively.
