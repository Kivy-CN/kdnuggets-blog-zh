    We need to close these loops so the pipelines become more intelligent and flexible.
    The first step to achieving this is having a good monitoring system. While I did
    bash a bit on monitoring in earlier parts of this post, I do believe we should
    continue to think about monitoring of systems both at the predictive modeling
    layer as well as at the more upstream data layer. This is something that [Shreya](https://www.shreya-shankar.com/rethinking-ml-monitoring-1/) has
