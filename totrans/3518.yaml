- en: Scientific research is not about "preferring" one algorithm over another. It's
    about *understanding*. I am interested in understanding Boltzmann machines and
    I am interested in understanding all kinds of auto-encoders. The world of unsupervised
    learning is wide open. No clear winner but many interesting questions. As far
    as unsupervised pre-training goes, denoising auto-encoders are somewhat easier
    to train and use than RBMs, but give about the same results, so I would go for
    the former if I had to make a choice.

    many people thought those papers weren't that valuable. And now, deep learning
    and large-scale machine learning in general is fast becoming a billion dollar
    industry. It is absolutely the case that academic research set the stage for deep
    learning to really flourish in industry.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My main point is that machine learning is both about breadth as depth. You are
    expected to know the basics of the most important algorithms (see my answer to
    What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?). On the other
    hand, you are also expected to understand low-level complicated details of algorithms
    and their implementation details. I think the approach I am describing addresses
    both these dimensions and I have seen it work.

    on their website, letting you run arbitrary SQL queries on the provided tables.
    They also will provide answers for you (Where can I find answers to SQLZoo exercises?).

    new and those of us who understood it were trying to pioneer it's use in companies.

    basics and can do quality work.

    invent something new that could be potentially revolutionary.

    most of the work. I prefer doing a bit of everything myself, but it sounds like
    you want to focus more narrowly on the modeling. A big company might be a better
    fit. However I'd have this conversation with your current company first to see
    if you can shift your responsibilities to what you want.
