    It might be hard to digest its formal mathematical definition but simply put,
    a **random variable** is a way to map the outcomes of random processes, such as
    flipping a coin or rolling a dice, to numbers. For instance, we can define the
    random process of flipping a coin by random variable X which takes a value 1 if
    the outcome if *heads *and 0 if the outcome is *tails.*

    of ***least squares* **thatminimizes the sum of squares of the differences between
    the observed dependent variable and its values predicted by the linear function
    of the independent variable, often referred to as ***fitted values***. This difference
    between the real and predicted values of dependent variable Y is referred to as ***residual* **and
    what OLS does, is minimizing the sum of squared residuals. This optimization problem
    results in the following OLS estimates for the unknown parameters ?0 and ?1 which
