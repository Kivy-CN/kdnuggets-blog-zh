  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After generating a code, it is crucial to verify it on an isolated machine before
    pushing it to production or a remote repository. It is important not to fully
    rely on the code's functionality alone; ensure that it is utilizing the latest
    API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key aspects of software development is creating testing functions
    for critical functionalities. I understand that unit testing for applications,
    especially for machine learning engineers or data scientists, can be challenging.
    However, with the assistance of ChatGPT, you can generate testing cases for any
    function within seconds.
