- en: I have recently started using PyCharm as an alternative to Spyder, and am loving
    it. This article talks about some of the features of PyCharm that made me completely
    transition to PyCharm from Spyder. The below features are in comparison with Spyder,
    and not general IDEs.

    to several functionalities such as — testing your script from command line, downloading
    data files from gs/aws, git interaction.'

    you can add what all files needs to be added to gitignore, add, and commit. You
    can always view which branch you are on, which files are in modified, add, commit
    states (based on their color in project view) etc. Did I mention we can directly
    do git push from the Terminal present within IDE?'

- en: 'Plugins: PyCharm offers a lot of plugins to non-pythonic files too. So when
    you work with config files such as yaml/json/ini, or with shell scripts, or with
    sql/html/css files, the IDE knows what format is expected and does the indentation,
    highlighting keywords etc out-of-box. You can even work with iPython notebooks,
    though frankly it seemed messy and I would just go with Jupyter for notebooks.
    A few other noteworthy plugins are git, flask, vim etc.'

    best-practices that need to be maintained, such as creating a readme file, using
    virtual environments, managing requirements file etc. All these are handled quite
    easily with PyCharm. You can also easily do code-refactoring, check dependencies
    of an object, trace an object’s source etc very easily.'

    select the part of code you want to run, and just do a cmd+return. This is not
    so visibly direct in PyCharm, but is available (Option + Shift + E in Mac). This
    comes very handy while writing stand-alone scripts.'

    You *can *visualize the dataframes in PyCharm too, but its nowhere close to Spyder’s.
    Same with plots as well. The plot rendering in PyCharm takes significantly more
    time compared to Spyder.'

- en: 'Learning Curve: I think Spyder‘s popularity with Data Scientists comes from
    the fact that it is very simple. You install it, open it, and you just know how
    it works. But PyCharm has a bit of learning curve, such as setting up its interpreter,
    figuring out how to run your selection of code and not the whole code etc. You
    need to spend a few hours to really understand and appreciate its workings.'

- en: Ideally, if you are working on a project where you will work on multiple scripts
    interacting with each other, you should definitely try PyCharm. If all your scripts
    are stand-alone analyses, Spyder (even better - *Jupyter*) should be sufficient
    for your needs.
