- en: These days you keep hearing about predictive maintenance and how valuable it
    is. It’s the utopia where equipment operators can anticipate impending malfunctions,
    preemptively schedule repairs, minimize disruption to factory operation, and,
    most importantly, protect equipment from catastrophic failures. With bright eyes,
    we can all agree on the value of predictive maintenance, or should I say the *expected*
    value of predictive maintenance?

- en: When it comes to talking about in-production implementations of predictive maintenance
    on equipment in the field, our bright eyes quickly lose their shimmer. It turns
    out that few companies have actually implemented predictive maintenance in operation,
    leading to the question, why is this the case?

    of the four key challenges that equipment builders and operators have to overcome
    to successfully work with the data science community and implement predictive
    maintenance solutions in operation:'

    designing the algorithms.** How can companies help foster collaboration between
    data scientists and domain experts so that powerful algorithms for predictive
    maintenance based on statistics methods in combination with domain knowledge are
    designed? How can data scientists and domain experts collaborate closely with
    each other to ensure that the key components of every powerful predictive maintenance
    application — data analytics methods *and* domain knowledge — are fully leveraged?'

- en: 'Successful predictive maintenance applications combine both: statistics-based
    data analytics methods, like machine learning, as well as the domain expertise
    that the R&D engineers have about their equipment (in many cases, already captured
    in simulation models). Approaching predictive maintenance with a pure data analytics
    approach will miss-out on important information held within the engineering and
    operations teams that build and support the equipment.'

    of machine learning is to train the algorithm on data from the field. This includes
    “good” data from uneventful production use as well as failure data captured for
    the various error scenarios that can occur while operating the equipment. But
    where can you get the failure data when the objective is to never allow the equipment
    to break in the first place?'

- en: For organizations applying predictive maintenance to industrial systems ranging
    from wind turbines to air compressors, this is becoming an increasingly important
    riddle to solve. As a way out of this dilemma, simulation models can be used to
    generate synthetic failure data to train the algorithms in the absence of measured
    failure data from the field.

    maintenance algorithm has been designed and trained on the desktop, it needs to
    be deployed on the equipment. The effort for this step highly depends on the IT
    and OT infrastructure in place. While some algorithms are implemented on a real-time
    hardware platform (e.g., on an embedded controller, an industrial PC, or a PLC),
    others will be incorporated into existing non-real-time infrastructure (e.g.,
    an edge device running on Windows or Linux) or in the cloud. More and more companies
    choose to go an efficient way of using toolchains that allow automatic generation
    of C or IEC 61131-3 code, .NET components, or standalone executables, like this

    that every company must be able to answer before even getting started with predictive
    maintenance is, how will I generate revenue with this?'

    build an elaborate predictive maintenance solution will quickly stall. Knowing
    your business case and having a strategy for monetizing predictive maintenance
    will help convince your company’s management to justify the investment in implementing
    a predictive maintenance application.

    fail during operation typically justifies the investment, the case for equipment
    builders is a bit more challenging. Some promising ideas that I have seen to help
