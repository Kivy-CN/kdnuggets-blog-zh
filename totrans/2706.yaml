- en: This book covers the building blocks of the most common methods in machine learning.
    This set of methods is like a toolbox for machine learning engineers. Those entering
    the field of machine learning should feel comfortable with this toolbox, so they
    have the right tool for a variety of tasks. Each chapter in this book corresponds
    to a single machine learning method or group of methods. In other words, each
    chapter focuses on a single tool within the ML toolbox.

- en: In my experience, the best way to become comfortable with these methods is to
    see them derived from scratch, both in theory and in code. The purpose of this
    book is to provide those derivations. Each chapter is broken into three sections.
    The *concept* sections introduce the methods conceptually and derive their results
    mathematically. The *construction* sections show how to construct the methods
    from scratch using Python. The *implementation* sections demonstrate how to apply
    the methods using packages in Python like scikit-learn, statsmodels, and tensorflow.

- en: There are many great books on machine learning written by more knowledgeable
    authors and covering a broader range of topics. In particular, I would suggest [An
    Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/), [Elements
    of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/), and [Pattern
    Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/),
    all of which are available online for free.

- en: 'While those books provide a conceptual overview of machine learning and the
    theory behind its methods, this book focuses on the bare bones of machine learning
    algorithms. Its main purpose is to provide readers with the ability to construct
    these algorithms independently. Continuing the toolbox analogy, this book is intended
    as a user guide: it is not designed to teach users broad practices of the field
    but rather how each tool works at a micro-level.'

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for readers looking to learn new machine learning algorithms or
    understand algorithms at a deeper level. Specifically, it is intended for readers
    interested in seeing machine learning algorithms derived from start to finish.
    Seeing these derivations might help a reader previously unfamiliar with common
    algorithms understand how they work intuitively. Or, seeing these derivations
    might help a reader experienced in modeling understand how different algorithms
    create the models they do and the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

- en: This book will be most helpful for those with practice in basic modeling. It
    does not review best practices—such as feature engineering or balancing response
    variables—or discuss in depth when certain models are more appropriate than others.
    Instead, it focuses on the elements of those models.

- en: The *concept* sections of this book primarily require knowledge of calculus.
    However, some require an understanding of probability (think maximum likelihood
    and Bayes’ Rule) and basic linear algebra (think matrix operations and dot products).
    The appendix reviews the [math](https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html) and [probability](https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html)
    needed to understand this book. The concept sections also reference a few common
    machine learning [methods](https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/appendix/methods.html),
    which are introduced in the appendix as well. The concept sections do not require
    any knowledge of programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *construction* and *code* sections of this book use some basic Python. The
    construction sections require an understanding of the corresponding content sections
    and familiarity with creating functions and classes in Python. The code sections
    require neither.
