    of interactions and discussions with some of the largest data leaders in the world,
    including the Head of Data & Analytics @ Google, the Senior Director of Engineering
    @ NVIDIA, and the VP of Data Science and Engineering @ Wealthsimple.

    perspective. I’m specifically not referring to data from scraped job postings
    because, from my experiences, there seems to be quite a disconnect between job
    descriptions and what’s actually done on the job.

- en: You might notice that **none** of the seven skills have anything to do with
    machine learning or deep learning, and this is not a mistake. Currently, there
    is a much higher demand for skills that are used in the pre-modeling phases and
    post-modeling phases. And so, the seven most recommended skills to learn actually
    overlap with the skills of a data analyst, a software engineer, and a data engineer.

    to learn in 2021:**

- en: 1) SQL
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL is **the **universal language in the world of data. Whether you’re a data
    scientist, a data engineer, or a data analyst, you’ll need to know SQL.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL is used to extract data from a database, manipulate data, and create data
    pipelines — essentially, it’s important for almost every pre-analysis/pre-modeling
    stage in the data lifecycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing strong SQL skills will allow you to take your analyses, visualizations,
    and modeling to the next level because you will be able to extract and manipulate
    the data in advanced ways. Also, writing **efficient **and **scalable **queries
    is becoming more and more important for companies that work with petabytes of
    data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you think creating data visualizations and storytelling are specific to the
    role of a data analyst, think again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Data visualizations** simply refer to data that is presented visually — it
    can be in the form of graphs, but it can also be presented in unconventional ways.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data storytelling takes data visualizations to the next level — **data storytelling** refers
    to “how” you communicate your insights. Think of it as a picture book. A good
    picture book has good visuals, but it also has an engaging and powerful narrative
    that connects the visuals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing your data visualization and storytelling skills are essential because
    you’re always selling your ideas and your models as a data scientist. And it’s
    especially important when communicating with others who are not as technologically
    savvy.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From my interactions, Python seems to be the go-to programming language to learn
    over R. That doesn’t mean that you can’t be a data scientist if you use R, but
    it just means that you’ll be working in a language that is different from what
    the majority of people use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning Python syntax is easy, but you should be able to write efficient scripts
    and leverage the wide-range of libraries and packages that Python has to offer.
    Python programming is a building block for applications like manipulating data,
    building machine learning models, writing DAG files, and more.

    data manipulation and analysis. As a data scientist, you’ll be using this package
    all the time, whether you’re cleaning data, exploring data, or manipulating the
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pandas has become such a prevalent package, not only because of its functionality
    but also because DataFrames have become a standard data structure for machine
    learning models.

    like machine learning models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s becoming increasingly important that data scientists not only know how
    to build models but how to deploy them as well. In fact, a lot of job postings
    now require some experience in model deployment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason that it’s so important to learn how to deploy models is that a model
    delivers no business value until it is actually integrated with the process/product
    that it is associated with.

    More specifically, Airflow allows you to create automated workflows for data pipelines
    and machine learning pipelines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    want to use for further analysis or modeling, and it’s also a tool that you can
    use to deploy machine learning models.
