    2014, [![Crowdflower-logo](../Images/1f220b9f5e5304869f260ceaa730270a.png)](http://www.crowdflower.com/)Data
    Science is ready to witness new trends emerging and dominating in 2015\. While
    some of these trends are widely acceptable, others are slightly debatable. Only
    time will tell the real winners. Until then, we all would have to decide for our
    self which 2015 trend to believe in.

    platform, recently released an interesting infographic based on the response of
    their data scientists’ expectation for 2015\. Here are a few insights from their

    as we have already seen a lot of articles in 2014 criticizing the over-use of
    “Big Data” term, rendering it essentially meaningless. Like “Innovation” or “Disruption”,
    “Big Data” is being used today for pretty much anything and everything related
    to Data Science, and this definitely needs to stop.'

    is expected to gain significance in 2015\. People are increasingly realizing the
    value of unlocking data from the silo-ed data warehouses and making it freely,
    easily accessible.

    across organizations. In 2015, we expect these **Data Scientists to start collaborating**
    (within as well as across organizations) in order to capture greater value from
    data.

    greater profit. But, now we are starting to see the value of **Big Data for social
    good**. We expect more initiatives and conferences on this in 2015, than we saw
    in 2014.

    or geeks, to be able to analyze and use data can be a disruptive force in 2015\.
    Several software releases in 2014 have focused on massive consumerization of analytics,
    and we are yet to see what users will do with this power (combined with Open Data
    initiatives).'
