    any objective set of criteria would not work in this case. The only requriements

    learning](/2017/01/current-state-automated-machine-learning.html) (AutoML). It's
    an area of machine learning (and data science) which shows massive future promise,
    and which is already paying dividends today. Projects like [TPOT](/2016/05/tpot-python-automating-data-science.html)
    and [auto-sklearn](/2016/08/winning-automl-challenge-auto-sklearn.html) are great
    places to get your feet wet, and some of the first major steps in the direction
    of automating automation (though AutoML has been around for a long time).

    challenge winner auto-sklearn. Give it a dataset with known outcomes (labels)
    and it tunes massively parallel ensembles of data sicence machine learning pipelines.
    As a result you get a list of predicted outcomes for your new data and an estimated
    prediction precision.

    -- beyond that it looks like something we all want to try.
