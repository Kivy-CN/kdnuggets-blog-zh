    for minds, arms, and budgets in the Data Science and ML industry. Although AWS’s

    be the intrigues part of the market reshaping in the years to come. At the same

- en: Further proliferation of Databricks as a Cloud ML product in 2022 could be affected
    by the ongoing discussion whether doing ML on top of Spark is a good idea or not
    (while Spark ML libs are incredible powerful when it turns to the BigData-scale
    datasets, certain API drawbacks of Spark and Databricks leave some space for the
    criticism).

    its leading positions both in USA and China, with good growth potential in the
    UK and EU countries in 2022 as well.

    promotion for BigQuery ML offering; since it can be a real alternative to the
    BigData-scale ML offering of Databricks, it may change the landscape in Cloud
    ML tools in the upcoming year.

    up of data scientists and machine learners from all over the world with a variety
    of skills and backgrounds. The community has more than 3 million active members.
    Although it is not rigorously representative of the entire population of Data
    Science and ML professionals across the globe from the sociological perspective,
    it still constitutes the significant fraction of the practitioners and professionals
    in the field. Therefore, the results of the survey can really draw the projections
    of where the Data Science and AI/ML industry is likely to evolve in the next couple
    of years.

    has grown into a one-stop home for (un)structured data, automated ETL, collaborative
    data science notebooks, business intelligence using SQL, and full-stack machine
    learning built on open source MLflow. Interestingly, all three major cloud vendors
