    data scientists. And who can blame you? Data science is a growing field, even
    a decade after its now-infamous “sexiest job” accolade from the Harvard Business
    Review. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics currently [predicts](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm)
    the employment rate for data scientists will grow by 35 percent from 2022 to 2032\.
    Compare that to the average job growth rate, which is just 5 percent.
