    about each of these skills. Instead of throwing a bunch of resources at the wall
    for each skill, I will instead point out one or two which I believe have proven
    their merit, some of which in turn point to additional vetted resources.

    and in many cases gaining the expertise necessary for utilizing any of these particular
    skills on a daily basis or having an expert-level in-depth understanding of them
    could take many, many hours or even years of practice and study. But don't let
    that discourage you; get started learning now.

    which do not fit into the traditional SQL/relational database mold. As such, the
    term functionally includes database types such as graph databases, key-value stores,
    columnar databases, and document stores. These are all different, but have in
    common that they are employed when relation models are not feasible. 43.0% of
    respondents want to know more, and this article can help scratch the surface and
    point them in the right direction to learn more.
