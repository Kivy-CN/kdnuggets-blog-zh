  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a type of artificial intelligence
    technology that can create various types of content for users such as text, imagery,
    audio and synthetic data. Artificial intelligence has been able to achieve this
    by training the model to study and identify patterns linked to the input, and
    produce similar content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generative AI uses unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms
    and inputs a large amount of data. The neural network used in generative AI will
    learn patterns on the inputted data, where only a limited number of parameters
    are given so that the generative AI models can learn to make their own conclusions.

    high-quality content. You may have already heard of popular generative AI tools
    such as ChatGPT, DALL-E 2, and Bing AI.

- en: They are not currently publicly available, but Google plans to roll the service
    out to trusted testers throughout the year. They will start their trusted tester
    program with English in the United States, and then refine the tooling so that
    it is more catering to consumers, enterprises, and educational institutions in
    different countries and languages.

    which says ‘*Help me write*’. The aim is to take that initial workload of people
    and businesses, providing them with an instant draft to work with.

    This can simply be a few bullet points on your phone that you jotted down to prepare
    for a meeting. The Generative AI can then transform these bullet points into a
    well-written detailed summary, for you to provide to your team. You will be able
    to formalize, elaborate, shorten, bulletin, write a draft and find the right style
    or voice.
