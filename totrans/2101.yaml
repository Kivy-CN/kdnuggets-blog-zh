    humans. They are a sub-category of Generative AI, with a focus on text-based applications,
    while Generative AI is much broader including text, audio, video, images, and
    even, code!

    such as generating summaries and providing explanations, and answers to a wide
    range of questions. Typically, AI is used to assist human experts. Similarly,
    LLMs can augment your understanding of complex topics.

    a large model or small approximator models, which are less hungry on compute requirements,
    make a good trade-off for the accuracy they provide? Note that the larger models
    provide improved performance at the cost of consuming more computational resources,
    and in turn the budget.

    need robust guardrails to ensure their end users' data is safe. It is equally
    important to understand the prompting techniques to convey the query and get the
    information from the model.
  prefs: []

    such as by specifying the length, tone, or style of the response, to ensure the
    response is accurate, relevant, and complete.

    information to explaining complex concepts and data. However, successful implementation
    requires a business-first mindset to avoid getting into AI hype and find a real
    valid end-use. Furthermore, awareness of ethical implications such as verifying
    information, questioning the validity of responses, and being cognizant of potential
    biases and risks associated with LLM-generated content promotes responsible utilization
    of these models.
