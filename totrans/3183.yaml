- en: AI micro-segmentation uses many customer attributes and behaviors to bucket
    customers by estimated willingness to pay. To explain in simple terms, let’s assume
    we have three buckets. We segment our customers by (A) high paying customers,
    (B) medium paying customers and (C) low paying customers. One strategy to maximize
    profits would be to first sell only to the high paying customer group A. Then
    any remaining seats could be sold to medium paying group B. Lastly, any leftovers
    could be sold to low paying group C.

    to the departure date. Everyone knows to get a great price on an airline ticket
    you should book early!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, it’s not as easy as first selling to high paying group A, then medium paying
    group B and giving leftovers to low paying group C. In most cases the pricing
    and selling happens in the reverse order – Low paying group C, then medium group
    B and lastly high paying group A.
  prefs: []

- en: How then are sales to the high-paying group A maximized if selling to group
    C happens first? What prevents all the seats from being sold to low paying group
    C with no seats being left to sell to the high paying group A?

    each of them is willing to pay weeks in advance. Often before most of the customers
    have even decided to travel!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A big part of the AI pricing game is having AI learn everything about what is
    happening in the market. The goal is to have better information than competitors
    in order to make better decisions. This information advantage is sometimes referred
    to as asymmetric information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of demand prediction, asymmetric information allows the AI pricing
    engine to achieve a more accurate demand prediction than competitors. Ultimately,
    this advantage results in greater confidence by the pricing engine to hold a price
    or move it up or down to maximize profit in response to what is happening in the
    market.

- en: To see how this works, let’s take a hypothetical airline market with 3 airlines
    serving a destination like Porcupi, Montana. In the airline industry, Porcupi
    is a small town that sits in the ‘long tail’. This means it is just one of many
    towns and cities served where each generates only a small amount of revenue. However,
    like the classic example of Amazon.com, the sum of everything in the ‘long tail’
    adds up to be a massive revenue number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose you are an airline operator and you know a big festival will soon take
    place in Porcupi. You know that significantly more people will be going to Porcupi
    than the number of available airplane seats across all the competitors. If you
    are the only airline operator who knows about the big festival, then the pricing
    strategy is easy. Hold the price high until all the competitors have sold all
    their seats. Then, travelers will have to pay a high price for a seat on the last
    plane into Porcupi.
  prefs: []

- en: However, most of the 'long tail' markets don't generate enough revenue to economically
    justify hiring a human to monitor what's happening in a small city and then make
    micro-adjustments to prices. Similar to how Amazon leverages technology to autonomously
    make demand prediction and pricing decisions across half a billion products, the
    same is happening across many other industries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI can learn about local events that are happening in real time on a global
    basis far more economically than what could ever be achieved by a group of humans. This
    enables a company leveraging AI to gather asymmetric information which enables
    better demand predictions and strategic pricing decisions.

- en: Keep in mind, this doesn't imply you will receive a 'personalized price' even
    though it is technically possible. The practice of 'personalized pricing' is highly
    debated for numerous reasons including ethical, brand, loyalty and legal concerns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, 'willingness to pay' can be used to determine how likely you will purchase
    an item at the current market price. This likelihood gets incorporated into demand
    predictions by micro-segment and, ultimately, the price. Consequently, the AI
    engine can control sales velocity by knowing how much to sell at what price.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Predicting competitive response + demand + micro-segmentation + ‘maximum price
    willing to pay’ are all based on probabilities. There will always be some level
    of ‘error’ in the predictions. In other words, things may sell a little faster
    or slower than expected. AI pricing engines use dynamic demand shaping to change
    the shape of the demand curve by adjusting prices. This could be based on real-time
    inventory or any other myriad of factors. In the airline and hotel pricing world,
    demand shaping can be used to optimize profit and minimize overselling or underselling
    airline seats and hotel rooms.

    topics discussed in this article are broadly applicable to a wide range of industries
    and business scenarios outside just dynamic pricing of airline seats and hotel
    rooms. Manufacturers estimate demand to know which products to produce in what
    quantities. Distributors manage pricing and demand forecasts to optimize inventory
    and distribution logistics. Marketers use demand estimations to make decisions
    of promotions, targeting and marketing spend.  Advanced algorithmic techniques
    and AI engines are quietly transforming how organizations compete.
