- en: A data scientist might not have domain knowledge about the system of interest.
    For instance, depending on the organization you are working for, you may have
    to work with a team of engineers (industrial dataset), doctors (healthcare dataset),
    etc., in order to figure out what predictor features and target feature to use
    in the model. For example, maybe an industrial system has sensors that generated
    data in real-time, in this case, as a data scientist, you may not have technical
    knowledge about the system in question. So you will have to work with engineers
    and technicians for them to guide you to decide what features are of interest
    and what are the predictor variables and the target variable. Teamwork is therefore
    essential to piece together different aspects of the project. From my personal
    experience working on an industrial data science project, my team had to work
    with system engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, field engineers,
    and technicians over a period of 3 months just to understand how to frame the
    right problem to be solved with available data. Such a multidisciplinary approach
    to problem-solving is essential in real-world data science projects.

- en: In a real-world data science project, the dataset is often very complex. For
    instance, the dataset could contain thousands of features and maybe hundreds of
    thousands or even millions of observations. In addition to that, the dataset could
    also be dependent on both space and time. Hence it could be very challenging to
    figure out what kind of model to build, and what features to use for building
    the model. The scope of the project may be too huge that it can’t be tackled by
    a single person. In this case, the burden of the project can be made lighter by
    working with a team of other data scientists, data analysts, data engineers, as
    well as personnel from the industry. By delegating tasks to different team members,
    the workload can be made lighter and manageable. This would allow the project
    to be planned, designed, and executed within a reasonable time frame.

- en: How will the final model be deployed? How does the company executives and managers
    view the project? Are they willing to invest in the idea and implement recommendations
    for day-to-day decision-making? Will the recommendations improve the efficiency
    of business operations? Will it lead to improved customer experience? Does it
    lead to an increase in profit? What are the financial implications of the model
    in terms of cost-savings? As a data scientist, you will have to work with company
    leaders and executives to try to convince them that your model or deliverable
    is worthy and has far-reaching implications that could save the company lots of
    money. In order to determine the business implications of your model, teamwork
    will play a great role as you will have to work with engineers and other officials
    from the business department to determine what cost-savings your model will produce
    if implemented.

- en: In summary, we’ve discussed 3 important reasons why teamwork is important in
    real-world data science projects. Without teamwork, real-world data science problems
    would be impossible to solve. Academic training programs should therefore design
    capstone projects that have industrial implications. If possible, the academic
    programs could invite local companies to suggest and recommend capstone projects.
    Students working on the project will have to be fully engaged in all aspects of
    the project from problem framing to data analysis, model building, testing, evaluation,
    and implementation. Collaborations with industry officials throughout the duration
    of the project have to be prioritized. That way students can have the opportunity
    to work on a multidisciplinary and diverse team. Such a multidisciplinary approach
    to problem-solving will enable them to develop essential teamwork, communication,
    leadership, and business acumen skills that are required for success in the real
    world.
