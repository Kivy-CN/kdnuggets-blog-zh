    of their time looking at data and finding statistical drawings or conclusions
    from it. But a big thing that is a required skill for these professionals and
    anyone looking at data is having a good intuition for the real world.

    is good to note that it produces a finite-dimensional representation. This is
    where you will have to see beyond the data and figure out what the hidden reality
    is and how it can be applied to the dataset.

    your data, and ensuring you apply the real world - without restricting yourself
    from seeing it from a data viewpoint.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 1972 Colin R. Blyth introduced the name Simpson’s paradox, also known as
    Simpson’s reversal, the Yule-Simpson effect, amalgamation paradox or reversal
    paradox.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simpson’s Paradox is when a trend or output is present when the data is put
    into groups that either reverse or disappear when the data is combined. It is
    a statistical paradox where it can draw two opposite conclusions from the same
    data, depending on how the data is grouped.

- en: A popular example of Simpson’s paradox is UC Berkeley’s study on gender bias
    in graduate school admissions. In 1973, at the start of the academic year, UC
    Berkeley's graduate school admitted around 44% male applications and 35% female
    applicants. The school feared that they were up against a lawsuit, therefore prepared
    for this by asking Peter Bickel, a statistician to have a look at the data.

- en: What he found out was there was a statistically significant gender bias that
    was in favor of women in 4/6 departments, and that there was no significant gender
    bias in the remaining 2\. The team's findings showed the women applied for departments
    that had an overall smaller percentage of applicants.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Simpson’s Paradox, you need to take into consideration real-world scenarios
    and variables that can be hidden and not easily interpreted through data. In this
    example, the hidden variable is that more women were applying for a specific department.
    This affects the overall percentage of accepted applicants, in a way that shows
    the reverse trend that initially existed in the data.

- en: The team then concluded that their output on the data changed when they took
    it into account when dividing the school into departments.

    process much harder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you start to resample your data differently, you will come out with different
    conclusions. This will naturally make it harder for you to choose one specific
    accurate conclusion to draw further insights. This means that the team will have
    to find the best conclusion that has a fair representation of the data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When working with data-related projects, we are often focused on the data and
    try to interpret the story it’s trying to tell us. But if we apply real-world
    knowledge, it would tell us a completely different story.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding the importance of this opens up more opportunities for us to look
    deeper into the data and perform sufficient analysis to help in the decision-making
    process. Simpson’s Paradox focuses on how a lack of sufficient analytical insight
    and overall project knowledge can mislead us and make wrong decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, we are seeing a rise in the use of real-time data analytics. More
    and more teams are implementing this to help detect patterns, and use this insight
    to make decisions in short periods. Working with real-time data analysis is effective
    when you are focusing on how to improve a company based on the current real-time
    data. However, these short periods can cause misleading information and hide the
    overall true trend that the data shows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The wrong data analysis can hold a company back. And we all know that wrong
    decisions always hold a company back. Therefore, taking into consideration Simpson’s
    paradox benefits the company to understand the limitations of the data, what drives
    the data, and the different variables and keeps bias low.

    of understanding data and their level of data intuition. This is when a lot of
    data professionals' soft skills will present themselves, such as critical thinking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The aim is to look for hidden biases and variables that are present in the data,
    which may not be easily discoverable at first look or when high analysis has been
    performed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing to take into consideration about Simpson’s paradox is that too much
    aggregation of data can soon become useless and start to introduce bias. But on
    the other hand, if we don’t aggregate the data, the data can be limited in the
    information and underlying patterns it can tell us.

    ensure you have a good understanding of the business problem at hand.
