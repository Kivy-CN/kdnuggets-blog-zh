    “reading, writing, and arithmetic;” to reading, writing, and computing. Learning
    how to program is an essential part of education, therefore understanding the
    nature of computer science is where any newbie should be.

- en: 'In under 4 weeks, this course covers the first half of our book Computer Science:
    An Interdisciplinary Approach (the second half is covered in our Coursera course
    Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines). The course starts by introducing
    basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and
    I/O and then dives into functions, introducing key concepts such as recursion,
    modular programming, and code reuse. But that’s not all - you will dive a bit
    deeper into object-oriented programming, where you will use the Java programming
    language and learn computational problem-solving.'

    dive deeper into algorithms, the theory around it and understanding machines as
    a whole. The course consists of 11 modules, where you will learn classic algorithms
    along with scientific techniques for evaluating performance and classic theoretical
    models that allow us to address fundamental questions about computation, such
    as computability, universality, and intractability. Once you get your head around
    those modules, you will conclude with machine architecture (including machine-language
    programming and its relationship to coding in Java) and logic design (including
    a full CPU design built from the ground up).

    computer science. Some say it's imperative, whilst some say there’s no need. Personally,
    I say there’s no harm in learning something that can improve your understanding.
    But the fact is that data science contains math. In this course, you will learn
    the basic math you will need to be a successful data scientist, machine learning
    engineer, or software engineer.

    real number line, interval notation and algebra with inequalities and the uses
    for summation and Sigma notation. You will also dive deeper into exponents, logarithms,
    and the natural log function, as well as probability theory, including Bayes’
    theorem.

    sound very daunting but it doesn’t have to be when you’re learning Python. Python
    is one of the most popular programming languages due to its simplicity. So why
    not start with learning Python?

    to tuples and dictionaries. This course provides you with the fundamental building
    blocks of programming in a fun and useful way. In under 4 weeks, you could become
    a junior Python specialist.
