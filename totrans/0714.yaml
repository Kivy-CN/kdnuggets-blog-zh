    as it often involves passive consumption of information. You are not getting your
    hands dirty, experimenting, or actually building anything. You are simply absorbing
    content from a screen. But what if I told you that there is a more engaging and
    effective way to grasp data science tools and concepts? That’s right. Today, we
    are going to explore 10 GitHub repositories that will help you master data science
    concepts through interactive courses, books,  guides, code examples, projects,
    free courses based on top university curricula, interview questions, and best
    practices.
