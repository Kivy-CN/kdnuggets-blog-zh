- en: In both L1 and L2 regularization, when the regularization parameter (α ∈[0,
    1]) is increased, this would cause the L1 norm or L2 norm to decrease, forcing
    some of the regression coefficients to zero. Hence, L1 and L2 regularization models
    are used for feature selection and dimensionality reduction. One advantage of
    L2 regularization over L1 regularization is that the L2 loss function is easily
    differentiable.

- en: We observe from the figure above that as the regularization parameter α increases,
    the norm of the regression coefficients become smaller and smaller. This means
    more regression coefficients are forced to zero, which intend increases bias error
    (over simplification). The best value to balance bias-variance tradeoff is when α is
    kept low, say α=0.1 or less.
