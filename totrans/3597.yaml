  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MLOps stands for machine learning Operations and is a combination of machine
    learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering. For the point of this article, I will
    define each.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When working with models, it can get messy. It can be time-consuming to run,
    it can get problematic when you’re trying to reach other members of your team,
    and can cause major problems in communication.

- en: Data Scientists sometimes don’t work with other tech experts on the team. Their
    roles and responsibilities differ and they sometimes don’t need to ever communicate.
    However, over time as models have been developed, collaboration with Data Scientists
    is imperative as they are responsible for curating, cleaning, and gathering insight
    from the datasets which is then further used in the building of AI models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you include all tech experts on the team to come together to collaborate
    on a project, you will naturally see an increase in the development of your model.
    There will be faster deployment times, better management of the model, and validation
    - all due to the fact that different skills were brought together.

- en: With the right MLOps architecture in place, you and other experts on the team
    are able to track, version, re-use, and audit every aspect or asset of your machine
    learning model lifecycle. This not only improves its reliability in an efficient
    way but also provides transferable knowledge that can be applied in the future.

    a better business understanding, and then move on to understanding the data to
    then determine how to design the ML-powered application.

    available, its limitations, and the functions of our ML model. These will act
    as the building blocks to help design the architecture of the ML application and
    ensure we’re one step closer to solving our problem.

    of our ML application. It is advisable to apply the Proof-of-Concept for ML Model
    method during this stage. The Proof-Of-Concept method is used in order to help
    with the validation process by further examining scalability, technical abilities,
    limitations, etc.

    If your models rarely change/trained or you are at the start of implementing ML
    - this process is probably for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a very experimental and iterative process due to its manual nature - therefore
    every phase such as data transformation, validation, model testing, and training
    are all done manually. The most typical tools used in manual processes are Jupyter
    Notebooks.

- en: ML Pipeline Automation
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This includes a process that does not require manual execution - your model
    needs to be trained automatically. During this process, when there is new data
    available, the pipeline is aware and triggers a response for the model to be retrained.
    This is known as continuous training.

    environment and continuously require these indicators to be addressed.

    in which you require a robust automated CI/CD system. With this CI/CD system put
    in place, it allows your data scientists and other tech experts to dig deeper
    to explore new ideas around feature engineering, model architecture, and hyperparameters.
  prefs: []

    the machine learning model and all its training pipeline components are built,
    tested and deployed automatically.
