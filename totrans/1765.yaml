    there are convincing reasons that show analytics is more [important and relevant](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111872464X.html)

    data problem several millennia ago. To see how, let us summarize a chapter from
    Yuval Noah Harari’s great book ‘[A Brief History of Humankind’](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095).

    and looking for sweet berries. At this point in history data was already crucial.
    If you always forgot that snakes are dangerous and red mushrooms are poisonous
    your chances of survival were slim. Luckily, the amount of important data was
    small so people could store everything they needed to know in their brains. However,
    when humans started living in bigger settlements and communities the limits of
    our brainpower became painfully obvious.

    Many problems that arose were data related and could not be solved with the conventional
    technique of the day: memorization. For example, local rulers had to know how
    much grain they had in their inventories and whether it was enough to survive
    the winter. There were taxes to be collected from thousands of inhabitants and
    thus payment data that had to be stored. There were legal systems that had to
    handle property data and ever growing families that had to keep track of their
    family tree. There was just so much more data around than before that just learning
    everything by heart, like we had been doing for millennia, was never going to
    work out.'

    roughly 5000 years ago that encoded their thoughts into abstract symbols, which
    in turn could be interpreted by others who were familiar with the rules of this
    system. This made storing and processing information outside early humans’ brains
    possible for the first time ever. Writing was born.
