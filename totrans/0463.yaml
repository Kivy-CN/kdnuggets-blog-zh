- en: The role of data science is to use unfathomable amounts of data every company
    is collecting nowadays and turn it into understandable and useful information.
    This transformation of data into information is done by using techniques such
    as machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and statistical analysis.
    All that is done with the purpose of solving real-world problems. Real-world usually
    translates as business problems. This means companies use data science to make
    more sound business decisions and make more profit.

    They use data and summarize it into the reporting format. This gives less technical-savvy
    users the possibility to use this data and understand various aspects of the company’s
    business. Data analysts primarily use historical data.

    However, they are more concerned with predicting the future and not so much with
    explaining the past. They use data to see what will happen, not what already happened.
    To do that, they apply statistical methods to data, such as hypothesis testing
    and probability. In that way, statisticians are also similar to data scientists.

    only on the statistics part of data science.

    You move to a marketing department to work only with marketing data and become
    a marketing scientist. Then again, it’s time for a change; you got interested
    in machine learning and became a data scientist. After several years of that,
    you’d like to go back to school and get a Ph.D. You quit the job and dedicate
    yourself to getting a Ph.D. That, combined with your vast working experience,

- en: Often, being high in demand and getting paid rather sweet money comes with a
    price. No, it’s not all rosy in data science. While usually working 40 hours per
    week, data scientists occasionally need to put in long hours. Again, it depends
    on the company, its organization, the industry, and other numerous factors. But
    most often, it goes with the job description and its periodical nature which means
    you’ll balance between completely relaxed and easy periods and peaks when you’ll
    have to put in 50-60 working hours per week.

    problems within strict deadlines. As the deadline approaches, the workload usually
    increases, and that’s when data scientists have to put in some extra hours.

    for becoming a data scientist. To complete this first step, follow the useful
    advice we offered when we talked about [how to become a data scientist from scratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist-from-scratch/).
    But does this make you a great data scientist? Not necessarily.

- en: The point of data science is solving real-life problems. You can have all the
    technical skills in the world, but if you can’t use those brilliant skills to
    come up with a solution, what’s the point? Or you come up with a solution, but
    nobody understands it and uses it. Did you really solve the problem? No, you didn’t.

    efficiently, ask the right questions, present your ideas and solutions in an understandable
    way. When people feel you’re open for suggestions, that you’re listening to them,
    and treating them with respect, they will be much more involved in the project.
    They will be willing to explain their (business) needs and problems in much more
    detail, making it easier for you to understand what is required of you properly.

    business, marketing, reporting, legal, or any other aspect of the industry you
    work in easily makes you a very desirable employer. Experts that can bridge the
