- en: As an experienced entrepreneur, one of the most challenging aspects of navigating
    a deep tech startup has been the difference in marketing approaches. In deep tech,
    a significant amount of time is spent in stealth mode, focusing on research and
    development before promoting any products or services. Unlike other industries,
    where marketing can begin early in the product development process, deep tech
    startups must exercise caution and ensure that any claims made are scientifically
    proven and validated.

    promoting our offerings once we had achieved specific milestones or reached a
    particular threshold of confidence in our technology. It has been essential to
    maintaining our reputation in the scientific community and among potential investors
    and customers, as credibility is crucial in this field. Any premature or unsubstantiated
    claims could quickly damage our reputation and hinder our ability to succeed in
    the long run.

    fit and execution strategy. In other words, for tech startups, the emphasis is
    on how the business will be carried out rather than whether it is even feasible.
    Deep tech startups, on the other hand, face a high risk of scientific failure
    due to the inherent nature of research activities and the uncertainties involved.

    Mariam Khayaredinova (CEO & co-founder) and myself. We wanted to first validate
    the need for our solution and assess the possibilities of achieving our goals.
    Once we were confident in the potential of our idea, we decided to raise additional
    capital from angel investors. Leveraging my previous exit and our strong track
    record, we were able to secure around $1 million from angel investors and additional
    $350K from the founding team.
