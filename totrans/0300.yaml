- en: If we look at the future of technology and the different elements of software
    development, it is not just about technical prowess. Soft skills for over the
    past few years have been dominated by automation and artificial intelligence.

- en: However, what these automated processes do not have are intangible abilities,
    such as communication, empathy and emotional intelligence.

- en: We’re living in the coming of the digital age. Organisations are building products
    that need to be sold - this requires great sales skills. They want to continuously
    develop their products - this requires you to be able to effectively communicate
    to stakeholders. They want the workflow to go as smoothly as possible - this requires
    you to work seamlessly in teams. They want to be bigger and better - this requires
    you to be creative.

    the ability to bring members of the team together to work in a more collaborative
    manner. However, since the pandemic, companies are putting the culture of the
    company first. More organisations are looking to build a more diverse and inclusive
    workspace.

    - you also need to communicate with your team. It is normal for tech professionals
    to have a date night with the computer and completely forget about their team.

    in multiple ways - till you decide on which solution is the best. Having a creative
    angle will allow you to resolve issues more effectively as well as present to
    stakeholders your ability to continuously improve the organisations overall business
    goals.

- en: In a remote-based working environment alongside the use of generative AI tools
    to help complete your daily tasks - it can be difficult to realise the importance
    of empathy. Your computer does not have feelings, but your team members and clients
    do.
  prefs: []

- en: Empathy allows you to understand issues and problems from another person's perspective
    without just assuming ‘the code is broken’. Their brain is not broken, they are
    seeing an issue or problem from a different angle and require empathy to resolve
    it.

    deadlines with little to no flexibility. Coupled with organising yourself, time-management
    will allow you to reach those deadlines.

    to organise yourself during your week. For example, cleaning the data takes 35%
    of my time, therefore I will start my week with this so I can complete the analysis
    by the end of the week to present back to stakeholders.
