- en: Data scientists are constantly navigating a changing field, along with its evolving
    technologies and techniques. The rapid growth and dynamic nature of this industry
    conspire to demand continuous learning and adaptation of participating professionals.
    Due to this constant growth, to be active and viable practitioners requires continued
    personal development. There are always more concepts, tools, and technologies
    to take up and master for both the novice and established data scientist.

    advice for becoming a better data scientist by focusing on five different areas
    of proficiency. Whether you are starting out, or looking to get grounded after
    years as a practitioner, jump in and elevate your game.

- en: Understanding the fundamentals of the required mathematics is an elemental part
    of being able to work with data. The primary subjects of linear algebra, calculus,
    and probability are the grounding of so much of the modeling and algorithm work
    that data scientists do. The book [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)
    is an excellent reference to start with, as are the courses in Coursera's [Mathematics
    for Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science).
    [3Brown1Blue's YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) are another
    fantastic resource for these topics. Putting these mathematical fundamentals into
    practice in real projects and exercises will ensure your knowledge stays solid.

- en: 'Supposing one wishes to keep in-the-know and remain employable for the long-term
    in this field of both enormous breadth and depth, staying up-to-date on the latest
    tools, technologies, and methodologies can''t be overlooked. From technological
    innovations such as automated machine learning and interpretability processes,
    to large scale data technologies and state of the art machine learning algorithms,
    the landscape from "good to know" to "need to know" is in constant flux. This
    isn''t a frivolous concern: people and organizations want to be able to incorporate
    the latest where appropriate. What better place to keep on such topics as KDnuggets
    (you''re already here), along with our sister sites [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/)
    and [Statology](https://www.statology.org/).'

    Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog),
    [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/), and a whole host of others are
    worthy of your time as well. The myriad podcasts, webinars, and YouTube channels
    all provide alternative avenues, with something that fits everyone''s preferences.
    Communities and conferences, both online and in-person, can be great ways to both
    network and stay up in the latest trends.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This can''t be overstated: proficiency in one or more of Python, R, and SQL
    — key programming languages in the field — is an absolute must for anyone wanting
    to be a useful data scientist. Libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib (Python)
    and packages such as dplyr and ggplot2 (R) for data work are important skills
    to acquire. Learning the most efficient ways to approach writing SQL queries is
    equally important, as SQL remains one of the most used language worldwide, especially
    when it comes to data science. There are, of course, many other languages that
    could come in handy for data work — Java, Rust, C++, Go, Javascript, Ruby... the
    list goes on and on. You can pick and choose from these what makes sense for you,
    but don''t learn them to the neglect of The Big Three mentioned above; it just
    isn''t worth the risk.'

    or through GitHub contributions, one can improve their coding skills. Working
    on group projects necessitates an understanding of Git, which a person can use
    for version control. In short, don't buy into the hype that you don't need to
    code. If you can't, someone else will be needed to do so, and since there are
    so many data scientists that code, how do you positively differentiate yourself
    from them? Be a strong coder as a baseline, and then add on additional skills
    to set you apart.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Working with fresh facts and figures is a must for anyone wanting to be more
    than an academic in this field. There is nothing better than solving data issues
    on your own initiative and doing. Methods to do so include competing on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/),
    taking on independent challenge projects, or even seeking out internships or volunteer
    work. By accurately solving a concern, including applying algorithms fittingly,
    understanding the various datasets, and recording all this work, people build
    up a [robust portfolio](https://www.kdnuggets.com/5-free-platforms-for-building-a-strong-data-science-portfolio).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The difference between sharing your portfolio project based on a reworking of
    the the Iris dataset and performing some in-depth analysis on robust and contemporary
    real-world data is night and day. Use real and valuable data.

- en: In order to put complex analysis results in the hands of a non-academic audience,
    strong communication is key to success. Telling a complelling story with one's
    data along with eye-catching visualizations, a captivating and well-crafted accompanying
    speech, and supporting artifacts intended to preemptively answer questions and
    fill in the blanks for listeners is what it takes to convey a message well. Several
    tools are available to assist in your data science story time, including Tableau,
    Power BI, and even PowerPoint or Google Slides.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alongside this persuasive projection, an effective data scientist will also
    employ active listening and preemptive question-answering, essential in conveying
    your sense of domain authority. These same skills can also help improve team effectiveness
    and project output. Expressing your ideas and findings, and working well with
    both the analytical team and your eventual audience, is another critical component
    of an effective data scientist, and re-doubling your efforts on mastering this
    aspect can help you step up your game.

    ways to help the average data professional improve their game. Learning and growth
    in data science is continuous and constantly changing, so make sure you are all
    aboard when it comes to this journey.
