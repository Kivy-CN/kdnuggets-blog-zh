    Notebooks gathering notes on [the Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) from
    Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (2016). The aim of these notebooks
    is to help beginners/advanced beginners to grasp linear algebra concepts underlying
    deep learning and machine learning. Acquiring these skills can boost your ability
    to understand and apply various data science algorithms. In my opinion, it is
    one of the bedrock of machine learning, deep learning and data science.

    it gives a sense of what is most used in the domain of machine learning and deep
    learning. It is thus a great syllabus for anyone who want to dive in deep learning
    and acquire the concepts of linear algebra useful to better understand deep learning
    algorithms.

    enough linear algebra to be confortable with machine learning and deep learning.
    However, I think that the chapter on linear algebra from the [Deep Learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is
    a bit tough for beginners. So I decided to produce code, examples and drawings
    on each part of this chapter in order to add steps that may not be obvious for
    beginners. I also think that you can convey as much information and knowledge
    through examples than through general definitions. The illustrations are a way
    to see the big picture of an idea. Finally, I think that coding is a great tool
    to experiment concretely these abstract mathematical notions. Along with pen and
    paper, it adds a layer of what you can try to push your understanding through
    new horizons.

    I tried to bind the concepts with plots (and code to produce it). The type of
    representation I liked most by doing this series is the fact that you can see
    any matrix as linear transformation of the space. In several chapters we will
    extend this idea and see how it can be useful to understand eigendecomposition,
    Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or the Principal Components Analysis (PCA).

    see that such systems can’t have more than one solution and less than an infinite
    number of solutions. We will see the intuition, the graphical representation and
    the proof behind this statement. Then we will go back to the matrix form of the
    system and consider what Gilbert Strang call the *row figure* (we are looking
    at the rows, that is to say multiple equations) and the *column figure* (looking
    at the columns, that is to say the linear combination of the coefficients). We
    will also see what is linear combination. Finally, we will see examples of overdetermined
    and underdetermined systems of equations.

    a positive value. It can be thinks as the *length* of the vector. It is for example
    used to evaluate the distance between the prediction of a model and the actual
    value. We will see different kind of norms (L⁰, L¹, L²…) with examples.

    by getting some ideas on eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We will see that a matrix
    can be seen as a linear transformation and that applying a matrix on its eigenvectors
    gives new vectors with same direction. Then we will see how to express quadratic
    equations into a matrix form. We will see that the eigendecomposition of the matrix
    corresponding to the quadratic equation can be used to find its minimum and maximum.
    As a bonus, we will also see how to visualize linear transformation in Python!

    as *sub-transformation* of the space. Instead of doing the transformation in one
    movement, we decompose it in three movements. As a bonus, we will apply the SVD
    to image processing. We will see the effect of SVD on an example image of Lucy

    inverse is used to solve system of equations. In some cases, a system of equation
    has no solution, and thus the inverse doesn’t exist. However it can be useful
    to find a value that is almost a solution (in term of minimizing the error). This
    can be done with the pseudoinverse! We will see for instance how we can find the
    best-fit line of a set of data points with the pseudoinverse.
