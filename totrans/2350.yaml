- en: The AdaBoost algorithm, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a type of Boosting technique
    that is used as an Ensemble Method in Machine Learning. It is called Adaptive
    Boosting due to the fact that the weights are re-assigned to each instance, with
    higher weights being assigned to instances that are **not** correctly classified
    - therefore it ‘adapts’.

- en: Boosting is a method that comes under ensemble machine learning algorithms and
    is used to reduce errors in predictive data analysis. It does this by combining
    the predictions of weak learners. Boosting was more of a theoretical concept before
    it became a practical concept.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The AdaBoost algorithm uses short decision trees, during the data training period.
    The instances that are incorrectly classified are given priority and are used
    as inputs for the second model - known as weak learners. This process happens
    again and again until the model attempts to correct the predictions made by the
    model before.
