    meet the demand in the technology sector. Many people delved into it as it seemed
    at the time to be the next big thing to get into. The salaries were generous and
    there was always room for growth. At that point, it seemed like a win-win.

    the new technologies that are amongst us and their continuous growth will disrupt
    85 million jobs globally between 2020 and 2025—and create 97 million new job roles.
    Yikes, only 2 more years to go. This was posted in 2020, with them also stating
    that analytical thinking, creativity and flexibility are among the top skills
    that will be needed for the year 2025.

    as we expected, executives and senior management will have the least impact. But
    as you have less experience, the impact becomes greater. Entry-level employees
    will have less impact than experienced and first-level management, which may contradict
    the above statement.
  prefs: []

    and first-level management employees?

    When we’re thinking about keeping up with technology, the majority of people are
    thinking about learning hard skills such as coding or getting into tech product
    management. This IBM report shows that executives estimate that 40% of their workforce
    will need to reskill due to AI and automation.

    the year 2016 to 2023\. As we can see in the images below, skills such as proficiency
    in STEM and basic computer and software applications which we all deemed highly
    desirable over the years have shown to plummet in importance. Skills such as time
    management, working effectively in a team and communication are at the lead.

    to be augmented, rather than replaced, by generative AI. 87% is a lot.

    will need to embrace reskilling or upskilling aswell as harness AI tools to enhance

    whilst the generative AI does not mean learning how to code, but more so time
    management and collaboration.
