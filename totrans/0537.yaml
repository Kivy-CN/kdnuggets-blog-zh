    to create value out of data has attracted businesses, which, as a result, has
    driven new investments in this field.

    for data scientists, cause lots of people to make a career change to work in this
    field.

    into the field. I think what makes it hard to take the first step are the following
    reasons:'
  prefs: []

    evaluate the required skills.

    education system yet.

    that list data science projects to put in your resume or portfolio.

    data science libraries and frameworks, machine learning algorithms, and so on.
    However, they lack an important skill.

- en: A data scientist identifies a problem and comes up with a suggested solution.
    The projects listed in those articles lay out the problem and solution for you.
    Moreover, it is relatively easy to obtain the required data in a neat and clean
    format.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since most of those projects are so common, the solution or implementation can
    easily be found online. Thus, think of them as projects to practice your skills.
    Unfortunately, they are not enough to convince hiring managers that you are a
    good candidate for a data scientist position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we should do instead is to find a problem that can be solved with data
    and design our solution. The problem does not have to be complex, and we do not
    have to provide the best and most efficient solution. We might even fail to properly
    solve the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, being able to frame a problem that can be solved with data is more
    valuable than completing such commonplace projects. It proves your analytical
    thinking skills and clearly demonstrates that you have a comprehensive understanding
    of data science.
  prefs: []

- en: It helps a lot to convince your future employer to have one or two projects
    that you build from scratch. You might even end up having a new business idea.
    Another advantage of having unique projects is that they attract recruiters and
    hiring managers. They are likely to reach out to you instead of you applying to
    numerous positions.
  prefs: []

- en: You may argue that it is a highly challenging task to come up with a new project
    idea. I completely agree with you. This is the reason why I call it the best project
    to have in your portfolio.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m aware that it takes a great amount of time, effort, and thinking to come
    up with a unique project idea. Moreover, you will be spending long hours trying
    to implement your idea. It is important to point out that you might end up having
    a failed project. However, what you learn throughout the process are likely to
    be some skills that you cannot learn from a MOOC course or any tutorial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will also be improving your skills on how to approach an issue. You will
    learn how to evaluate a task from different perspectives. In some cases, the solution
    you have in mind does not fit the libraries or frameworks you are comfortable
    working with. Thus, it will also motivate you to learn new tools.

- en: The 10 projects to have in your portfolio sounds appealing. I did some of those
    projects too. However, keep in mind that most people you compete with to get a
    data scientist job are doing those 10 projects as well. You will not be left behind,
    but doing the same thing will not take you further ahead either.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hiring managers or recruiters will know how much you put into a project. Some
    of the popular commonplace projects can be completed in a day or two. Thus, you
    will have a hard time demonstrating your skills based on those projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m definitely not against doing these common projects. They are valuable in
    terms of practicing and improving your hard skills, but that’s all they can offer.
  prefs: []

    present a project designed and implemented by you.
