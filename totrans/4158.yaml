    property. Such compromises and assumptions are essential, but equally so is the
    ability to state what assumptions we made. That way, others can critique your
    approach and understand its limitations.

    no matter which course you choose, tackle projects as often as possible. Find
    a problem you're interested in and keep programming until you have something that
    solves it. Show off your solution, use it to help others, and even make a career
    out of it. Using Python — and programming in general — to create value for yourself
    and others is a rewarding feedback loop that will keep you working, moving forward,
    and getting better.
