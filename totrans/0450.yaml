- en: Of all the roles in the tech world, data scientists probably have the highest
    variation in titles and job responsibilities. A data scientist has to wear a lot
    of different hats, and the day-to-day work of a [data scientist at Amazon](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/amazon-data-scientist-position-guide/)
    could look significantly different from that of a [data scientist at Microsoft](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/microsoft-data-scientist-position-guide/).
    From finding areas of the company’s business that could benefit from collection,
    analysis, and understanding of data to deciding what strategic decisions must
    be made to improve customer satisfaction or purchase completion rates, a company
    can ask a lot of data scientists.

    often economical skills and knowledge. A [data scientist needs to be highly skilled](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/most-in-demand-data-science-technical-skills/)
    in math, statistics, machine learning, visualizations, communication, and algorithm
    implementation.

    of their data. If you’re analyzing tree growth data, you should understand the
    difference between [height and height to crown base](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201877).
    This kind of contextual knowledge can be developed on the job, but it can be a
    big advantage if you already have experience working in the industry if you are
    looking to become a data scientist. If you’ve been a banker for five years, your
    odds of getting a data science position in fintech are much better than in healthcare.

    and cleaning. You could also be required to develop machine learning models and
    pipelines or serve your company as a visualization guru. Some data scientists
    are more [internal-facing](https://svpg.com/leveraging-data-science/) while others
    have a lot to do with internal, non-technical teams or even clients. If you work
    with less technical people, you’ll have to have [stellar communication skills](https://www.martinsights.com/?p=1256),

    Where did it come from, what can we learn from it about the past and how can it

    you have gained from it.

    exact definition. If one of these sounds perfect to you, then you can narrow your
    search down to that one title, but if several of them sound good, then I would
    be more flexible with the title you use when searching. (And if the title really
    matters to you, you can always make that part of your negotiation when you get
