    also to those who have spent time working within the field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Focusing on newcomers, however, I find from requests that I receive from those
    interested in join the data field in some capacity that there is often (and rightly)
    a general lack of understanding of what it is one needs to know in order to decide
    where it is that they fit in. In this article, we will have a look at five distinct
    data career archetypes, and hopefully provide some advice on how to get one's
    feet wet in this vast, convoluted field.

    not to add an additional layer of complication. We will also omit executive level
    positions such as Chief Data Officer and the like, mostly because if you are at
    the point in your career that this role is an option for you, you probably don't

- en: The data architect is concerned with managing data and engineering the infrastructure
    which stores and supports this data. There is generally little to no data analysis
    needing to take place in such a role (beyond data store analysis for performance
    tuning), and the use of languages such as Python and R is likely not necessary.
    An expert level knowledge of relational and non-relational databases, however,
    will undoubtedly be necessary for such a role. Selecting data stores for the appropriate
    types of data being stored, as well as transforming and loading the data, will
    be necessary. Databases, data warehouses, and data lakes; these are among the
    storage landscapes that will be in the data architect's wheelhouse. This role
    is likely the one which will have the greatest understanding of and closest relationship
    with hardware, primarily that related to storage, and will probably have the best
    understanding of cloud computing architectures of anyone else in this article
    as well.

    invaluable, and will likely be some of the main tools of an ongoing data architect's
    daily work after a data infrastructure has been designed and implemented. Verifying
    the consistency of this data as well as optimizing access to it are also important
    tasks for this role. A data architect will have the know-how to maintain appropriate
    data access rights, ensure the infrastructure's stability, and guarantee the availability
    of the housed data.

    engineer is concerned with building and maintaining data pipelines (see below),
    the data architect is focused on the data itself. There may be overlap between
    the 2 roles, however: ETL; any task which could transform or move data, especially
    from one store to another; starting data on a journey down a pipeline.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the data infrastructure? It's the collection of software and storage
    solutions that allow for the retrieval of data from a data store, the processing
    of data in some specified manner (or series of manners), the movement of data
    between tasks (as well as the tasks themselves), as data is on its way to analysis
    or modeling, as well as the tasks which come after this analysis or modeling.
    It's the pathway that the data takes as it moves along its journey from its home
    to its ultimate location of usefulness, and beyond. The data engineer is certainly
    familiar with [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps) and its integration
    into the data lifecycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From where does the data infrastructure come? Well, it needs to be designed
    and implemented, and the data engineer does this. If the data architect is the
    automobile mechanic, keeping the car running optimally, then data engineering
    can be thought of as designing the roadway and service centers that the automobile
    requires to both get around and to make the changes needed to continue on the
    next section of its journey. The pair of these roles are crucial to both the functioning
    and movement of your automobile, and are of equal importance when you are driving
    from point A to point B.

- en: Truth be told, some the technologies and skills required for data engineering
    and data management are similar; however, the practitioners of these disciplines
    use and understand these concepts at different levels. The data engineer may have
    a foundational knowledge of securing data access in a relational database, while
    the data architect has expert level knowledge; the data architect may have some
    understanding of the transformation process that an organization requires its
    stored data to undergo prior to a data scientist performing modeling with that
    data, while a data engineer knows this transformation process intimately. These
    roles speak their own languages, but these languages are more or less mutually
    intelligible.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm using *data analyst* in this context to refer to roles related strictly
    to the *descriptive* statistical analysis and presentation of data. This includes
    the preparation of reporting, dashboards, KPIs, business performance metrics,
    as well as encompassing anything referred to as "business intelligence." The role
    often requires interaction with (or querying of) databases, both relational and
    non-relational, as well as with other data frameworks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the previous pair of roles were related to designing the infrastructure
    to manage and facilitate the movement of the data, as well managing the data itself,
    data analysts are chiefly concerned with pulling from the data and working with
    it as it currently exists. This can be contrasted with the following 2 roles,
    machine learning engineers and data scientists, both of which focus on eliciting
    insights from data above and beyond what it already tells us at face value. If
    we can draw parallels between data scientists and inferential statisticians, then
    data analysts are descriptive statisticians; here is the current data, here is
    what it looks like, and here is what we know from it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data analysts require a unique set of skills among the roles presented. Data
    analysts need to have an understanding of a variety of different technologies,
    including SQL & relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and commercial
    and open-source reporting and dashboard packages. Along with having an understanding
    of some of the aforementioned technologies, just as important is an understanding
    of the *limitations* of these technologies. Given that a data analyst's reporting
    can often be *ad hoc* in nature, knowing what can and cannot be done without spending
    an ordination amount of time on a task prior to coming to this determination is
    important. If an analyst knows how data is stored, and how it can be accessed,
    they can also know what kinds of requests — often from people with absolutely
    no understanding of this — are and are not serviceable, and can suggest ways in
    which data can be pulled in a useful manner. Knowing how to quickly adapt can
    be key for a data analyst, and can separate the good from the great.

    tools used to leverage data. Machine learning algorithms allow for the application
    of statistical analysis at high speeds, and those who wield these algorithms are
    not content with letting the data speak for itself in its current form. Interrogation
    of the data is the *modus operandi* of the machine learning engineer, but with
    enough of a statistical understanding to know when one has pushed too far, and
    when the answers provided are not to be trusted.

    researcher and practitioner. Maths such as linear algebra and intermediate calculus
    are useful for those employing more complex algorithms and techniques, such as
    neural networks, or working in computer vision, while an understanding of learning
    theory is also useful. And, of course, a machine learning engineer must have an
    understanding of the inner workings of an arsenal of machine learning algorithms
    (the more algorithms the better, and the deeper the understanding the better!).

    a formalized approach for dealing with the issues arising in productionizing machine
    learning models.

    above, depending on their exact role. And this is one of the biggest problems
    related to "data science"; the term means nothing specific, but everything in
    general. This role is the Jack Of All Trades of the data world, knowing (perhaps)
    how to get a Spark ecosystem up and running; how to execute queries against the
    data stored within; how to extract data and house in a non-relational database;
    how to take that non-relational data and extract it to a flat file; how to wrangle
    that data in R or Python; how to engineer features after some initial exploratory
    descriptive analysis; how to select an appropriate machine learning algorithm
    to perform some predictive analytics on the data; how to statistically analyze
    the results of said predictive task; how to visualize the results for easy consumption
    by non-technical folks; and how to tell a compelling story to executives with
    the end result of the data processing pipeline just described.

    however, the emphasis in this role is on the data, and what can be gleaned from
    it. Domain knowledge is often a very large component of such a role as well, which
    is obviously not something that can be taught here. Key technologies and skills
    for a data scientist to focus on are statistics (!!!), programming languages (particularly
    Python, R, and SQL), data visualization, and communication skills — along with
    everything else noted in the above archetypes.
