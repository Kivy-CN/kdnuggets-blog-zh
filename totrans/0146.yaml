- en: In the realm of large language models (LLMs), there has been a constant pursuit
    to enhance the capabilities of smaller models without compromising their efficiency.
    The traditional approach has been to use imitation learning, where smaller models
    learn from the outputs generated by large foundation models (LFMs). However, this
    approach has been marred by several challenges, including limited imitation signals
    from shallow LFM outputs, small-scale homogeneous training data, and a lack of
    rigorous evaluation. This often leads to smaller models imitating the style but
    not the reasoning process of LFMs.

    GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707)** introduces Orca, a 13-billion parameter
    model designed to imitate the reasoning process of large foundation models (LFMs)
    such as GPT-4\. Unlike traditional large language models (LLMs), Orca employs
    a unique training approach that combines progressive learning and teacher assistance
    to overcome the capacity gap between smaller student models and their larger counterparts.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Orca's training process consists of two stages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the first stage, Orca is trained on FLAN-5M, which includes ChatGPT augmentations.
    This intermediate teacher assistant helps bridge the capacity gap between Orca
    and GPT-4, which has a significantly larger parameter size. By leveraging ChatGPT's
    capabilities, Orca benefits from improved imitation learning performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second stage, Orca undergoes training on FLAN-1M, which incorporates
    GPT-4 augmentations. This progressive learning approach follows a curriculum learning
    paradigm, where the student model learns from easier examples before tackling
    more challenging ones. By gradually exposing Orca to increasingly complex reasoning
    and step-by-step explanations, the model enhances its reasoning abilities and
    mimicking skills.

- en: Orca's training methodology offers several advantages over traditional LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, it addresses the capacity gap issue by utilizing an intermediate teacher
    model, allowing Orca to learn from a more capable source. This approach has been
    shown to improve imitation learning performance for smaller student models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, the progressive learning aspect of Orca's training enables the model
    to build upon its knowledge incrementally. By starting with simpler examples and
    gradually introducing more complex ones, Orca develops a stronger foundation for
    reasoning and explanation generation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, Orca's ability to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs like GPT-4
    opens up possibilities for enhanced performance in various tasks. By tapping into
    the rich signals provided by GPT-4's explanation traces and step-by-step thought
    processes, Orca gains valuable insights and improves its own capabilities.

- en: Orca has shown remarkable performance in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks.
    It outperforms traditional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models like Vicuna-13B
    by over 100% on benchmarks like Big-Bench Hard (BBH) and over 42% on AGIEval.
    Additionally, Orca achieves the same scores as ChatGPT on the BBH benchmarks and
    shows competitive performance on professional and academic exams such as the SAT,
    LSAT, GRE, and GMAT. This is particularly impressive considering that these are
    zero-shot settings without chain-of-thought, and Orca still performs competitively
    while trailing behind GPT-4.
