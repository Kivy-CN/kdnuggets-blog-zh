    And when I say you should carefully plan a career in data science, I am nowhere

    degree vs what you end up doing in a day job? I, for one, certainly do. Learning
    theory does not suffice in data science – you may have done a lot of titanic practice
    in Kaggle and built sentiment analysis on the nicely served data. But working
    on a real project is a different game altogether. No one will ask or advise you
    to go build one among many skills that are needed to deliver that particular project
    – it is onto you to learn while on the job and deliver the work. The veterans
    always keep an eye on the cutting-edge advanced algorithms, and what are the pros
    and cons of existing algorithms. They don’t wait for the right opportunity to
    slam at their door to wear the spectacles and burn the midnight oil. Basically,
    they never get into the comfort zone of – I know it all.
