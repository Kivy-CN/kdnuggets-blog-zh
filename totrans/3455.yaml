- en: There is definitely an established machine learning ecosystem, or, perhaps more
    accurately, a small set of established machine learning ecosystems. For research
    it would seem that the undisputed champion of machine learning ecosystems is centered
    on Python and its many libraries which support the data preparation and subsequent
    machine learning process itself, whether it be via [scikit-learn](/tag/scikit-learn),
    one of the many deep learning libraries available, or home-spun and highly specialized
    tools for achieving the same goals. This says nothing of the great support tools
    that grow up around the edges of the ecosystem, some of which become polished
    and useful enough to carve out [their own eventual niche](/2016/05/five-machine-learning-projects-cant-overlook.html).

    option. There are Java-based tools ([Deeplearning4j](/?s=deeplearning4j), [Weka](/?s=weka)),
    those integrated with Apache Spark and/or Hadoop ([MLlib](/?s=mllib), [Mahout](/?s=mahout)),
    C++ solutions (TensorFlow is written in C++, as are many others in the Python
    ecosystem), and even those for Clojure, F#, Rust, and a whole host of other languages,
    environments, and ecosystems.

- en: Javascript does not generally come up when talking about machine learning-friendly
    programming languages, however. Given its formidable [market share](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index)
    and [Atwood's Law](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/),
    which states that any application that can be written in JavaScript, eventually
    will be written in JavaScript, it would seem that there may be something more
    going on here. Atwood's Law may not be the foregone conclusion it once was (at
    least, not in the view of many), but one could argue its validity vis-a-vis machine
    learning as easily as one could argue its validity vis-a-vis anything else.

    Many of them are not specific to Javascript, but address any non-Python (or non-established
    ecosystem) language. In other words, *that's just how it is*. Others touch on
    technical issues of speed, ease of reading and writing code, and complexity of
    the environment, among others.

    computer science, or statistical processes, machine learning can be accomplished
    with Javascript. The options? Code something up yourself, or have a look at the
    following, a small sampling of both general machine learning and neural network
    libraries for Javascript. Some libraries actually also use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/),
    to be clear; check it out if you are unfamiliar.'

- en: The process for selecting the "top" libraries for Javascript was more art than
    science; given the somewhat comparative lack of options for the language, along
    with the challenge of finding well-used, supported, **and** maintained (the trifecta)
    projects, some subjectivity was necessary to come up with a list worth looking
    at.

    is not terribly important, given the above paragraph, but numbering does make
    referring to the items easier...and I do like numbering things. Also, if you feel
    the list is not representative of the current offerings in this area, feel free

    including Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-nearest Neighbors, PCA, K-means
    Clustering, Neural Networks, and more. This would be one of those do-it-all (or
    do-a-lot-of-it) suites that could serve as a generalized classical machine learning
    workhorse in the right situation, a stop on the way to Javascript's answer to
    Scikit-learn.

    lack of time, and the most recent update is approximately 10 months ago. I have
    not played with ConvNetJS in several months, but had luck the last time that I
    did. I would speculate that an experienced JavaScript coder interested in using
    Javascript for deep learning would still be able to make use of the codebase,
    regardless of whether it worked out of the box today or not.
