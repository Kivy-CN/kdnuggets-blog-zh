    recommendation system, search engine, pricing optimization engine, data quality,
    and more. They make predictions for millions of users as they interact with our

    our preferred machine learning framework is [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
    As compute gets cheaper and time to market for machine learning solutions becomes
    more critical, we’ve explored options for speeding up model training. One of those
    solutions is to combine elements from Spark and scikit-learn into our own hybrid
    solution.

    The goal of the project is to provide a general framework for distributing scikit-learn
    meta-estimators with Spark. Examples of meta-estimators are decision tree ensembles
    ([random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and [extra randomized
    trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html)), [hyperparameter
    tuners](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) ([grid search](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) and [randomized
    search](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV))
    and multi-class techniques ([one vs rest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier.html#sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier) and [one
    vs one](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.multiclass.OneVsOneClassifier.html#sklearn.multiclass.OneVsOneClassifier)).

    traditional machine learning models. Outside of the space of neural networks and
    deep learning, we find that much of our compute time for training models is not
    spent on training a single model on a single dataset. The bulk of time is spent
    training multiple iterations of a model on multiple iterations of a dataset using
    meta-estimators like grid search or ensembles.

    Here we have encoded images of hand written digits to be classified appropriately.
    We can train a [support vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) on
    this dataset of 1797 records very quickly on a single machine. It takes under
    a second. But hyperparameter tuning requires a number of training jobs on different
    subsets of the training data.

    It takes only 3.4 seconds with sk-dist on a Spark cluster with over a hundred
    cores. The total task time of this job is 7.2 minutes, meaning it would take this
    long to train on a single machine with no parallelization.

    training. The first is the simplest: scikit-learn’s built-in parallelization of
    meta-estimators using [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This
    operates very similarly to sk-dist, except for one major constraint: performance
    is limited to the resources of any one machine. Even versus a theoretical single
    machine with hundreds of cores, Spark still has advantages like [fine tuned memory
    specification for executors](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/tuning.html), [fault
    tolerance](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/fault-tolerance-in-spark/), as well

    This is Spark’s native machine learning library, supporting many of the same algorithms
    as scikit-learn for classification and regression problems. It also has meta-estimators
    like tree ensembles and grid search, as well as support for multi-class problems.
    While this sounds like it may be a sufficient solution for distributing scikit-learn
    style machine learning workloads, it distributes training in a way that doesn’t
    solve the kind of parallelism of interest to us.

- en: As shown above, Spark ML will train a single model on data that is distributed
    on many executors. This works well when data is large and won’t fit into memory
    on a single machine. However, when data is small this can *underperform* scikit-learn
    on a single machine. Furthermore, when training a random forest for example, Spark
    ML trains each decision tree in sequence. Wall time for this job will scale linearly
    with the number of decision trees regardless of the resources allocated to the
    job.

    implement a [parallelism](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator.parallelism) parameter
    that will train [individual models in parallel](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19357).
    However each individual model is still training on data that is distributed across
    executors. The total parallelism of the job is a [fraction of what it could be](https://github.com/Ibotta/sk-dist/blob/master/examples/search/spark_ml.py) if
    distributed purely along the dimension of models rather than data.

- en: Ultimately, we want to distribute our training on a different dimension than
    that of Spark ML. When using small or medium data, fitting the data into memory
    is not a problem. For the random forest example, we want to broadcast the training
    data in full to each executor, fit an independent decision tree on each executor,
    and bring those fitted decision trees back to the driver to assemble a random
    forest. Distributing along this dimension can be [orders of magnitude faster](https://github.com/Ibotta/sk-dist/blob/master/examples/search/spark_ml.py) than
    distributing the data and training decision trees in serial. This behavior is
    similar for other meta-estimator techniques like grid search and multi-class.
