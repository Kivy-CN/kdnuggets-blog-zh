    voice assistants answering our questions, smart cameras identifying faces, and
    self-driving cars navigating roads. They''re like the superheroes of our digital
    age! However, making these technological wonders work smoothly on our everyday
    devices is tougher than it seems. These AI superheroes have a special need: **significant
    computing power** and **memory resources**. It''s like trying to fit an entire
    library into a tiny backpack. And guess what? Most of our regular devices like
