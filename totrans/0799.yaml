    it to do just about anything. It can [generate functioning code](https://medium.com/@tanyamarleytsui/coding-with-chatgpt-b50ab3fcb45f)

    (for csv files) or [BlazeSQL](https://www.blazesql.com) (for SQL Databases) are

    you to upload/connect and explain your data every time you open them up.

    data in SQL databases inside private networks. Nonetheless specialized tools can
    connect to these secured SQL databases, and answer your questions by querying

    scientists are the ones with the technical skills to provide stakeholders with
    the insights they need. But things have changed, and now AI tools can successfully
    complete some of the tasks that could previously only be completed by data analysts
    and data scientists.
  prefs: []

- en: In theory a business stakeholder with no technical skills could now connect
    their data to an AI tool, and make a request such as “Get the monthly revenue
    grouped by product, for the top 3 products of the year”. The AI can then grab
    the data, and even visualize it. The user would only need to spend a few seconds
    writing out the request. If they had asked a human colleague, they might not have
    gotten an answer for a few days, or longer.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    “hallucination” in this context. When you ask them about something they don’t
    know about, they will sometimes **just make stuff up**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The reason for these hallucinations is simple: LLMs are like very advanced
    autocomplete algorithms. They return the **most likely next message** in a conversation,
    based on the data they were trained on. Thanks to high quality datasets and advanced
    training techniques, this “autocomplete” works so well that these tools can fulfill
    complex requests with remarkably high quality results. Unfortunately, when they
    encounter situations their training data did not prepare them for, the **most
    likely next message** might not actually make much sense.'

    code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    learn what some of the columns and values mean. This is because the data model
    was designed by the business. You can’t just analyze data without understanding
    where it comes from, because common knowledge isn’t enough to understand most
    databases.

- en: We can call these cases “blind spots”, and they also exist for writing code.
    Ex. A common blindspot AI has for generating SQL queries, is using subqueries.
    AI models will often generate queries that try to select a column from a subquery,
    even though that column does not exist in the subquery.

    few pages, and fit it into the AI model?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The widely available version of GPT-4, is limited to **12 pages** of input +
    output. Keep in mind that a data analyst will attend hours of meetings, and read
    documentation or reports. All the output (code, and explanation from GPT-4) needs
    to be subtracted from the 12 pages, since the limit includes the output, not just
    the input.
