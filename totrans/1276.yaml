    first time, it can be a daunting task. Many businesses aren’t fully aware of all
    that goes into building a data science department. If you're the data scientist
    hired to make this happen, we have some tips to help you face the task head-on.

- en: Being the only data scientist at a company is tricky. You may be expected to
    be the expert at everything data or code related. A good starting point is to
    break down the most important deliverables in the company. Understanding these
    deliverables and deconstructing them until you can lay out the most important
    data sources and processing steps is important in understanding exactly what needs
    to get done for this company.

- en: Staying organized is one of the most important aspects of building a successful
    team, but you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. There are many project planning
    practices that can help provide structure to your data processes. For example,
    The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs is a great resource for staying on track and
    organized during this planning process.

    are many foundations that need to be set in place before that can realistically
    happen. The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs, and other project planning tools
    like it, can help you structure a sound, sustainable path to your company’s data
    science goals.

- en: As the first data scientist, you can realistically expect that your non-technical
    colleagues will not understand your work and all the effort that goes into it.
    Therefore, it will be on you to report wins along the way towards deploying your
    first data model. This will ensure that your company stays up to date with your
    progress, and build trust in your ability to build and deliver.

- en: For example, a reliable data flow will be the cornerstone of the productivity
    of any data team. It’s a foundational part of the pyramid and it will empower
    you to swiftly tackle a variety of problems. While the non-technical decision
    makers at your company will mostly be concerned with the analytical results that
    you eventually derive from working with a reliable data flow, setting up that
    flow is no small feat, and a huge step in the path to getting those results. You
    should take the time to report that step to your team, and make them understand
    its importance in the larger process.

- en: Data visualization is often overlooked. It will prove to be one of the most
    important tools in your data science toolkit. Good data visualization is all about
    practice.

- en: An exercise to do before going to a meeting with stakeholders is plotting something
    and asking yourself questions that may arise among your audience. After that,
    make adjustments to the plots and then ask yourself questions again to see how
    well the graph addresses problems.

    important in the preparation process and your bosses will be impressed when you
    have solid answers to all their questions.

- en: Think of data visualization as a tool to communicate the value of your work.
    It makes a huge difference for non-technical people to understand all you’re trying
    to convey. Ultimately, it is key for communicating and selling your work outside
    of your team.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to machine learning, which may not be the priority at the beginning,
    always start with a naive model. By “naive model” we mean a simple model, just
    to get something that works end-to-end.
  prefs: []

- en: From there, you can work on tuning and improving, which will be a much easier
    process once you already have something that works.
  prefs: []

- en: You will find the most solutions can be deployed once 80-90% of the problem
    has been solved. Spending time and resources trying to get that last 10% will
    not be the data science problem but rather a management problem.

- en: Many people think data science is like magic and you are the magician. It’s
    important for you to manage these high expectations so that you can deliver on
    time, and avoid drowning in your workload and dragging out deadlines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can manage expectations by planning ahead, staying on task, and always having
    the end goal in mind. Doing this and staying organized will make sure that your
    higher-ups are always impressed with the work you’re doing.
