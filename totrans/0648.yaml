    starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. I was only a year
    old when the book came out in 1996\. Tyler Durden, the protagonist, talks about
    how the current generation is in a crisis because they haven't been witness to
    a landmark event which broke their lives in two, before and after. In a way, that
    was also true for a millennial like me, until the new coronavirus pandemic hit

    decades (e.g. Zimbabwe, Venezuela). Neither am I denying that parts of world have
    faced pandemics that have ravaged thousands of lives (SARS, Ebola, etc.). But
    almost all of these have been limited to certain parts of the world, so the other
    parts could come to the rescue. The devastation that the coronavirus has bought
    to the world at large–whether it be the overburdened health care systems, millions
    being put into lockdown, children missing school, or the economies taking a massive
    hit–has been largely unprecedented.

    classifier and 0.5 (meaning the curve follows the line y=x) represents a classifier
    which is as good as flipping a coin (random chance). An area under 0.5 means your
    classifier is even worse, and makes incorrect predictions more often than not.

- en: As far as COVID-19 is concerned, in this post we basically covered how to *detect*
    the disease through CT scans. But truth be told, you can't really detect pneumonia
    through CT scans. This is because pneumonia is what we call a "clinical diagnosis".
    Radiologists don't merely look at CT scans and pronounce patients as having COVID-19\.
    They may also look at blood work, clinical history, additional symptoms, etc.
    to arrive at a conclusion. This is because pneumonia caused by different reasons
    may or may not result in vastly distinct features in the CT scan. When a paper
    reports that a CT scan has better sensitivity than a RT-PCR, it actually means
    a method where doctors combine a CT Scan with other symptoms and features to diagnose
    a patient.

    one must be wary of flashy headlines such as this one when CheXNet came out.

    will do, however, is ease their work when there's a barrage of cases, as has happened
    with the coronavirus outbreak, and when time is of paramount importance.

    to identify lung X-Rays as COVID-19 or another infection. Currently there is no
    open source CT Scan dataset available for COVID-19, so we'll have to stick with
    X-Ray scans for now. (The data that was used in the papers we discussed above
    has not been made available in the public domain).
