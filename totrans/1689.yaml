    primarily concerned with data analysis and reporting, but does not include predictive
    modeling, so BI can be considered a subset of Data Science.'

    Analytics, or Data Science. Business Analytics, as the name implies, puts more
    emphasis on business skills and methods, while "Data Science" and "Data Analytics"
    put more emphasis on data engineering aspects.

- en: Machine Learning main focus is on the learning algorithms - it is not concerned,
    for example, with data visualization. Machine Learning studies not only learning
    from historical data, but also learning in real-time. A major part of ML are the
    algorithms for agents acting in the environment and learning from their actions.
    This is called [Reinforcement Learning](/tag/reinforcement-learning) (RL). To
    learn more about history and current state of RL, see my [Interview with Rich
    Sutton, the Father of Reinforcement Learning](/2017/12/interview-rich-sutton-reinforcement-learning.html).
