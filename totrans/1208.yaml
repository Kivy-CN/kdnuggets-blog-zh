- en: Data quality management uses a combination of professional knowledge and specialized
    tools to continually enhance the accuracy and reliability of a company’s information.
    The idea is to develop and implement sets of processes to enhance an enterprise’s
    future data quality and eliminate current information containing errors.

- en: A 2021 survey of more than [2,200 business intelligence professionals](https://bi-survey.com/top-business-intelligence-trends)
    found that respondents chose data quality management as the most important trend
    of the year. The research also indicated that the topic achieved the top spot
    in several previous years, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists can help business leaders embrace this trend. Making progress
    requires knowing how a company currently uses data and where weaknesses exist.
    Once data professionals have those insights, they can help company leaders make
    the most of the information they have now and monitor its quality.

- en: When business leaders invest in data storytelling, they blend data and narratives
    to break down complicated statistics into manageable formats for their audiences.
    For example, adding a bar graph to a company’s annual report makes it easier for
    stakeholders to digest and appreciate the data while seeing it in context.

    that [56% of marketers](https://venngage.com/blog/data-storytelling/) create data
    visuals for their fellow team members. Then, 52% of respondents made those resources
    for people working in sales.
  prefs: []

    still likely need data scientists to help source, clean, and organize the information.

- en: Data scientists also have welcome expertise about showing the material in ways
    that don’t mislead people. It’s not enough to present the content in a visually
    appealing way. Viewers also must interpret the data correctly, even if they only
    look at it briefly.

    want more personalization — even when seeing online product advertisements. In
    one 2020 study, 31% of people [showed more loyalty to brands that](http://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/07/14/2061942/0/en/STUDY-As-Brands-Continue-to-Navigate-Change-43-of-Consumers-Say-Digital-Ads-Should-be-Personalized.html)

    be more likely to buy something due to a personalized ad.

    to know too much about them. However, [one effective way](https://www.vistacollege.edu/blog/careers/business/how-new-business-trends-are-shaping-career-paths/)
    to help people feel more comfortable is to show transparency about how companies
    use the data and why they need it.

    to all applicable regulations when collecting, storing, and using information.
    With California already having a data privacy law and state legislators considering
    introducing such laws elsewhere, business representatives must understand their
    obligations.

    getting stored for examination days, weeks, or even months later. Business leaders
    are particularly interested in receiving timely information if they work in industries
    where late decisions could result in too many upset customers or lost profits.

    is prohibitively costly. Many brands use predictive analytics tools that give
    real-time data about machine performance and possible issues to address. Data
    scientists can help company leaders determine the best ways to use real-time data
    to meet business goals.

    ways to engage customers. It concerns sending people content when they take certain
    actions. For example, once a person signs up for an email list, they might automatically
    get a welcome message with a special offer.

    and confirm how company leaders could achieve business improvements through automated

    rate. If so, an automatic email to remind shoppers that they didn’t finish their
    purchases could drive completed transactions.

- en: Business leaders can also depend on data scientists to find statistics showing
    which email techniques work best. For example, is a person more likely to open
    an email with their first name in the subject line? What effect does putting a
    specific percentage off in the subject line have on customers’ interest in a sale?

    They realize that ongoing access to accurate information will aid decision-making
    and result in a stronger business. Data scientists can evaluate the best ways
    for a company to become more dependent on data and scale those efforts.

    list](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-data-and-analytics-trends-for-2021/)
    of top data and analytics trends for 2021\. They clarified that data-based activities
    were once secondary to main business operations and often tackled by a separate
    team. That’s changing, with data becoming a foundational element for the enterprise.
  prefs: []

    and miss related opportunities. Gartner’s experts suggest involving chief data
    officers to set goals and strategies. Doing that could result in the consistent
    production of business value that increases by a factor of 2.6 times, they said.

    otherwise have. However, making sense of that information isn’t always straightforward.
    Data scientists have the knowledge and skills needed to help company decision-makers
    take advantage of the information at their disposal and use it to succeed.
