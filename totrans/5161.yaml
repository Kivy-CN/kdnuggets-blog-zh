- en: The SQL Notes for Professionals [book](https://goalkicker.com/SQLBook) is compiled
    using [Stack Overflow Documentation Data Dump](https://archive.org/details/documentation-dump.7z).
    It is an unofficial free book by [GoalKicker](https://goalkicker.com/) created
    for educational purposes. In short, the content is a collection of various people
    at Stack Overflow. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language designed
    to manage relational databases. You can create, modify, and optimize database
    tables according to your needs. The core database modifying operations are performed
    using INSERT, SELECT, MERGE, UPDATE and DELETE.

    web developers say that 80% of the time they are storing data and fetching information.
    Our world revolves around data-driven products, and managing that data has become
    quite a lucrative career. Even if you are applying for machine learning engineer,
    the technical interviews will contain a couple of SQL-related questions. To excel
    in your career and pass the technical interview round of the recruitment process,
    it is necessary to revise all the concepts. The **free SQL book** helps you revise
    all the topics on database management using SQL script and even introduces you
    to new concepts that can optimize your current process.
