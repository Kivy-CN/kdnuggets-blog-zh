    from scratch for every new use case. This can be a time-consuming and inefficient
    process. no-code or low-code solutions help data scientists create reusable solutions
    that can be applied to a wide range of use cases. This can save time and effort
    and improve the quality of data science projects.

    code. "No-code or low-code solutions are the future of data science," commented
    [Ingo Mierswa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingomierswa), SVP of Product Development
    at Altair and founder of [RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/), a data science
    platform. As an established inventor in and of the No code data science field,
    his expertise and contributions have influenced the adoption and implementation
    of these functionalities in the industry. "These functionalities," Mierswa during
    our interview call remarked, "make it possible for people without a lot of programming
    experience to build and deploy data science models. This can help to democratize
    data science and make it more accessible to everyone."

    a computer scientist that I kind of recreated, very similar solutions for every
    new use case. It was an inefficient process, which felt like a huge waste of time,"
    Mierswa shares. Humoring with the basics, he articulated, "If you solve a problem
    for the second time and you are still coding, it means that you did not solve
    it correctly the first time. You should have created a solution that can be reused
    to solve the same or similar problems over and over again. "People, he asserts,
    "often don''t realize how similar their problems are, and as a result, they end
    up coding the same thing repeatedly. "The question they should be asking is, ''Why
    am I still coding?'' Perhaps they shouldn''t in order to save time and effort."'

    and most important benefit is that they can lead to better forms of collaboration,"
    Mierswa underscores. "Everyone can understand visual workflows or models if they
    are explained, however, not everyone is a computer scientist or programmer, and
    not everyone can understand code." So, in order to collaborate effectively, you
    need to understand what assets the team is collectively producing. "Data science
    is, at the end of the day, a team sport. You need people who understand the business
    problems, whether or not they can code, as coding may not be their daily business."

    thinking, who think like, "Okay, well, look, if I want to build, for example,
    some machine learning model, I need to transform my data in a specific way." That's
    a great skill, and they need to collaborate too, but again, for skills like that,
    we know ETL products have been out for ages. "Yes, in rare cases, in special,
    very custom situations, you still need to code. Even in those situations, that's
    the one percent exception," Mierswa pointed out. "It shouldn't be the norm, but
    the real magic happens when you bring together all the different skills, data,
    people, and expertise."

- en: '"You will never see that with a pure code-based approach. You will never get
    the buy-in from stakeholders. That often leads to what I call dead projects. We
    should be treating data science as a solution for problems. We should not treat
    it as a scientific approach, where it doesn''t matter if we actually create a
    solution or not." Mierswa reasoned. "It matters. We are solving multi-million
    dollar business problems here. We should actually work towards the working solution,
    getting the buy-in, get it deployed, and really improve our situation here. Not
    saying, ''Yeah, I know what if it fails, I don''t care.'' So collaboration is
    a huge benefit," he affirmed.'

    by coding, you're not working in the fastest possible way. If I create, for example,
    a RapidMiner workflow consisting of five or ten operators, that often is the equivalent
    of thousands of lines of code. Copying and pasting code can slow you down, but
    low-code platforms can help you create custom solutions faster.

- en: Accountability, often easily overlooked, is the most important benefit. When
    you create a code-based solution, it can be difficult to track who made changes
    and why. "This can lead to problems when someone else needs to take over the project
    or when there is a bug in the code. On the other hand, low-code platforms are
    self-documenting. This means that the visual workflows that you create are also
    accompanied by documentation that explains what the workflow does. "This makes
    it easier to understand and maintain the code, and it also helps to ensure accountability,"
    Mierswa said. "People understand it. They buy into this, but they also can take
    ownership of those results. Collectively, as a team."

    companies that want to stay ahead of the curve are open, using open source and
    open standards, and not hiding anything that is very important in the data science
    market.
  prefs: []

- en: Companies that have remained open have had a winning position because the market
    moves quickly and requires constant iteration. "This is true for the overall data
    science market over the past 10 to 20 years," Mierswa reflected, "the fast-paced
    nature of the market requires constant iteration, making it exceedingly unwise
    to close down the ecosystem. This is part of why some companies that have traditionally
    been closed have opened up and even adopted a vendor-neutral approach to support
    more programming languages and integrations."

- en: While the code-optional approach allows researchers to perform complex data
    analysis tasks without writing a single line of code, there are situations where
    coding may be necessary. In such cases, most low-code platforms integrate with
    programming languages, [machine learning libraries](https://kanger.dev/article/machine-learning-libraries),
    and deep learning environments. They also offer users the ability to explore the
    marketplace for third-party solutions, Mierswa specified. "RapidMiner even provides
    an operator framework that allows users to create their own visual workflows.
    This operating framework makes it easy to extend and reuse workflows, providing
    a flexible and customizable approach to data analysis."
