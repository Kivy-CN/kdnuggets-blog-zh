    is also a great way to share best practices and distribute knowledge among team
    members. At Appsilon, we treat code review as a must for every project. Read more
    about how we organize our work in [Olga’s blog post](https://appsilon.com/remote-data-science-team-best-practices-scrum-github-and-docker/) on
    best practices recommended for all data science teams.

    the developer is responsible for writing good, clean code! Pointing out all of
    the code’s basic mistakes is painful, time-consuming, and distracts reviewers
    from going deep into code logic or improving the code’s effectiveness.

- en: Poorly written code can also harm team morale – code reviewers are frustrated
    while code creators might feel offended by a huge number of comments. That is
    why before sending the code to review, developers need to make sure that the code
    is as clean as possible. Also, note that there is not always a code reviewer that
    can come to the rescue. Sometimes you are on your own in a project. Even though
    you think the code is ok for you now, consider rereading it in a few months –
    you want it to be clear to avoid wasting your own time later on.

    and harder to master skill is knowing when *not* to add comments. Writing good
    comments is more of an art than a science. It requires a lot of experience, and
    you can write entire book chapters about it (e.g., [here](https://books.google.pl/books/about/Clean_Code.html?id=hjEFCAAAQBAJ)).

    to explain what is going on. Comment required business logic or exceptions added
    on purpose. Try to think of what can be surprising to the future reader and preempt
    their confusion.'

    spaces` – which is redundant. If the reader does not know what function `trimws` is
    doing, it can be easily checked. A more robust comment here can be helpful, e.g.: `trimws(.)

    Nevertheless, they can be computationally heavy and thus need to be used carefully.
    The rule of thumb that you should follow is: always double-check if looping is
    a good option. It is hardly a case that you need to loop over rows in `data.frame`:
    there should be a `{dplyr}` function to deal with the problem more efficiently.'
  id: totrans-31
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common source of issues is looping over elements using the length of
    the object, e.g. `for(i in 1:length(x)) ...`. But what if the length of x is zero!
    Yes, the loop will go another way for iterator values 1, 0\. That is probably
    not your plan. Using `seq_along` or `seq_len` functions are much safer.
  id: totrans-32
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, remember about the `apply` family of functions for looping. They are great
    (not to mention `{purrr}` solutions)! Note that using `sapply` might be commented
    by the reviewer as not stable – because this function chooses the type of the
    output itself! So sometimes it will be a list, sometimes a vector. Using `vapply` is
    safer, as the programmer defines the expected output class.

    on other machines. And how crucial it is when you are sharing the code with the
    team! To achieve this, never use absolute paths in your code, e.g. “/home/marcin/my_files/old_projects/september/project_name/file.txt”.
    It won’t be accessible for others. Note that any violation of folder structure
    will crash the code.
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you should already have a project for all coding work, you need to use paths
    related to the particular project – in this case; it will be “./file.txt”. What
    is more, I would suggest keeping all the paths as variables in a single place
    – so that renaming a file requires one change in code, not, e.g., twenty in six
    different files.

    database or private repositories. You should never commit such secrets to the
    repository! Even if the entries are the same among the team. Usually, the good
    practice is to keep such values in `.Renviron` file as environmental variables
    that are loaded on start and the file itself is ignored in the repo. You can read
    more about it [here](http://www.dartistics.com/renviron.html).

    is that you should be able to guess what is inside just by reading the name, so `table_cases_per_country`is
    ok, but `tbl1` is not. Avoid abbreviations. Lengthy is preferable to vague. Keep
    consistent style for object names (like camelCase or snake_case) agreed among
    the team members.

- en: Do NOT abbreviate logical values `T` for `TRUE` and `F` for `FALSE` – the code
    will work, but `T` and `F` are regular objects that can be overwritten while `TRUE` and `FALSE` are
    special values.
  id: totrans-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do not compare logical values using equations, like `if(my_logical == TRUE)`.
    If you can compare to `TRUE`, it means your value is already logical, so `if(my_logical)` is
    enough! If you want to double-check that the value is `TRUE` indeed (and not,
    e.g., `NA`), you can use the `isTRUE()` function.
