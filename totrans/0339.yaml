    comfortable working all on your own. But as a data scientist, you should prioritize

    them to production, you may not find data science a rewarding career.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    And in the worst case, abandon your project if required.

    your job doesn't end with model building. Even if you manage to deploy a machine
    learning model to production, you have to monitor your model’s performance, look
    out for drifts, regress and retrain the model as needed.

    completely different. The roles of a data scientist, machine learning engineer,
    and MLOps engineer often have a lot of overlapping functionality.

    spreadsheets and making reports. Or pulling data from databases using SQL. You
    may think wrangling data with SQL and finding answers to business questions will
    better fit the role of data analyst.
  prefs: []

    mean? Am I a Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer,
    MLOps Engineer, or all of the above? Your role within a company is fluid if you
    are working at a smaller company or startup. However, larger organizations may
    have a clearer distinction between roles. But that doesn’t guarantee that the
    role is completely defined. You might be a data scientist; but a lot of the work
    you do will perhaps be creating analysis reports that align with business goals.”

    you can say that you have learned it all. What you need to learn and how much
    depends on what you’re working on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be a fairly simple task like learning and using a new framework going
    forward. Or something more tedious such as migrating the existing codebase to
    a language such as Rust for enhanced security and performance. Besides being technically
    strong, you should be able to learn and ramp up quickly on frameworks, tools,
    and programming languages as needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, you should be willing to learn more about the domain and the business
    if required. It’s not very likely that you'll work in a single domain throughout
    your data science career. For example, you may start out as a data scientist in
    healthcare, then move to fintech, logistics, and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During grad school, I had the opportunity to work on machine learning in healthcare—on
    a disease prognosis project. I’d never read Biology beyond high school. So the
    first few weeks were all about exploring the technicalities of specific biomedical
    signals—their properties, features, and much more. These were super important
    before I could even proceed to preprocessing the records.
