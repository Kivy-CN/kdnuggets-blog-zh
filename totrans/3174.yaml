    relatively simple tasks that are easy to operate for non-professionals. When it

    won’t be a barrier. If you plan to work with some ML-as-a-service system, the

    learning as this will reduce time spent on configuring a data source.

    they differ in tasks. This situation is quite common for this young market as
    even the three leading solutions that we’ve talked about aren’t fully competitive

    business value is tricky if you lack either data science or domain expertise.
    We at AltexSoft encounter this problem often when discussing machine learning
    applications with our clients. It’s usually a matter of simplifying the general
    problem to a single attribute. Whether it’s the price forecast or another numeric
    value, the class of an object or segregation of objects into multiple groups,
    once you find this attribute, deciding the vendor and choosing what’s proposed
