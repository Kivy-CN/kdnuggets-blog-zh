    together to enable MLOps that works for your organization. It provides practical
    advice to managers and directors looking to build a robust AI/ML practice with
    high-velocity AI teams.

- en: Only a couple of years ago, a considerable portion of AI/ML projects were the
    responsibility of data scientists. While some teams relied on a more advanced
    combination of roles and tools, data scientists handling models in notebooks was
    the industry norm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, hiring only a data scientist is not enough to deliver a viable AI/ML
    project to production quickly, efficiently, and at scale. It requires a cross-functional,
    high-performing team with multiple roles, each handling their own portion of [ML
    infrastructure](https://provectus.com/machine-learning-infrastructure/) and MLOps.

- en: In a modern team, a **data scientist or citizen data scientist** is still an
    essential member. Data scientists are subject matter experts who understand the
    data *and* the business holistically. They are hands-on in data mining, data modeling,
    and data visualization. They also stay on top of data quality and data bias issues,
    analyze experiments and model outputs, validate hypotheses, and contribute to
    the ML engineering roadmap.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A balanced AI team should also include an **ML engineer** whose skillset is
    different from that of a data scientist. They should have deep expertise in particular
    AI and ML applications and use cases. For example, if you build a Computer Vision
    application, the ML engineer should possess extensive knowledge of state-of-the-art
    deep learning models for Computer Vision.

- en: '**Note:** Every ML engineer should have MLOps expertise, but the ML/MLOps infrastructure
    itself, including its tools and components, should be the domain of a dedicated
    MLOps professional.'

- en: A **project manager** should also be trained to execute ML and AI projects.
    A traditional Scrum or Kanban project workflow does not work for ML projects.
    For instance, at Provectus we have a specific methodology for managing an ML project’s
    scope and timeline, and for setting the expectations of its business stakeholders.

- en: We will explore each of these (and other) roles in more detail, and explain
    how they map onto the ML infrastructure, the MLOps enablement process, and ML
    delivery. The takeaway message here is that AI teams need a balanced composition,
    in order to enable MLOps and accelerate AI adoption.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because companies’ understanding of ML workflow and AI project management is
    limited, no one from the above groups fully understands how to translate business
    goals into launching an AI product in production. As a result, it becomes impossible
    to manage the project’s scope and KPIs, resulting in failure to meet the expectations
    of business stakeholders.

- en: Some companies try to delegate AI projects to existing data science teams that
    historically work in their own silos and rely on Data Science approaches that
    do not work for AI/ML projects. As a result, they end up with unfinished products
    and projects that cannot be deployed to production.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other companies often assign AI projects to traditional Java and .NET developers,
    or leverage third party ML APIs. This approach also tends to fail, because you
    still need a deep understanding of data and its underlying algorithms to use these
    APIs efficiently. As a result, they end up with a growing technical debt in the
    form of Data Science code that will never see production.

    and tools. In the context of this article, this means a balanced AI team that
