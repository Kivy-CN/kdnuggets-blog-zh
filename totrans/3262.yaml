    I wrote about Artificial Intelligence (AI). When I last wrote about AI, I focused
    on the technological side: what is a part of an AI system and what isn’t. However,
    there is another question which might be more important; what are we doing with
    AI?'

    diligence](https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/due-diligence). I have discussions
    with them about companies they might want to invest in. Through this process,
    I have observed how [every company pitch](https://www.techemergence.com/venture-investments-in-artificial-intelligence-trends-in-2016-and-beyond/) is
    full of content on how they are using AI to solve a business problem.

    and I believe every entrepreneur should have a chance. Another part of me thinks
    of it as a built-in AI “[bullshit-meter](https://twitter.com/twentworth12/status/831562373425147904).” 
    That part of me wants to cringe every time I listen to a founder make something
    up about how AI will help his company. I have listened to many founders who do
    not know a lot about AI but know it will help them with funding. Who am I to judge?

    impact on a business—I also have seen situations where this was not the case. So,
    what was the difference?

- en: In most of the cases where organizations failed with AI or Machine Learning,
    they used those techniques in the wrong context. Machine Learning models are not
    very helpful if you only have one big decision to make. Analytics can still give
    you easier access to the data you need to make a decision by presenting the data
    in a consumable fashion. At the end of the day, those single, big decisions are
    often very strategic. Building a machine learning model or AI to help you make
    this decision is just not worth the effort. And often it doesn’t yield better
    results.

    they can’t without AI or ML, since they would need to make this decision millions
    of times, every day. Imagine sifting through your customer base of 50 million
    clients every day to identify those with a high churn risk. That’s impossible
    for any human, but it’s not a problem at all for a ML model.

    support us in big strategic decisions. **Machine learning delivers most value
    when we operationalize models and automate millions of decisions.**

    make them. The blue boxes are situations where analytics can help but do not provide
    the full value. The orange boxes are situations where AI and ML show real value.
    An interesting observation is that **the more decisions you can automate, the
    higher the value** (upper right end of this spectrum).

    a well-known researcher in the field of AI.  Andrew described [what AI can do](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now) as

    on automation and operationalization of those models, because this is where the
    biggest value is. The only thing I disagree with is the time unit he chose—it
    is safe to go with a minute instead of a second.

    it is to draw completely wrong conclusions from statistical models.
