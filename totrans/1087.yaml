    enterprise organizations. For a long time, though, data management referred to
    the storage of information and the occasional need to access that information.
    And, for much of that time, the importance of data management [has come second](/2019/10/data-scientist-data-management.html)
    to data analytics techniques like machine learning and artificial intelligence
    (AI).

    can no longer be understated. Organizations have so much data through which they
    need to sift that they can't afford to view data management as an afterthought
    to their data analytics efforts, especially considering that [as much as 90%](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/tapping-power-unstructured-data)
    of data worldwide is unstructured. Enterprises must rely on modern methods with
    which they can parse through sets of data that are largely unstructured.

    have to rapidly parse through unstructured data and examine several data management

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Enterprise organizations have, for pretty much the entire time the field of
    data science has existed, relied on manual techniques to parse through their sets
    of unstructured data. These manual techniques are unfortunately highly tedious
    [and require the manpower](/2020/09/honest-drowning-data.html) of multiple teams
    of data scientists just so that unstructured data can be parsed through and properly
    indexed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More organizations than ever are realizing that manual techniques to process
    and categorize unstructured data are no longer feasible solutions. Instead, enterprise
    organizations require commercial, automated data management solutions that make
    it much more viable for data scientists to parse through petabytes of data and
    continuously catalog it. These commercial solutions will make use of AI to automate
    the storage of unstructured data and can even recommend to data scientists ways
    to better optimize their methods of unstructured data storage.

    to the public, enterprise organizations should seriously consider supplementing
    their data analysis efforts with project management software. Robust project management
    software that [comes with critical features](https://www.freshbooks.com/projects-and-collaboration)
    such as web-based centralized storage of project files and project progress trackers
    can expedite the rate at which businesses analyze and process their large sets
    of unstructured data.

    management workflows can significantly reduce the time it takes for data scientists
    to process and index unstructured data and affords them more time to invest in

    their sets of (mostly structured) data by parsing their business systems for insight

    a growing number of companies are now offering products such as cloud-based data
    warehousing to better support systems to parse through sets of unstructured data.
    These companies recognize that unstructured data [is becoming more useful than
    structured data](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/industry-perspectives/unstructured-data-will-continue-shape-data-management-2022)
    for building relations with clients and consumers, and they are providing cloud-based
    data warehousing that can analyze disparate customer interactions in order to
    better hone in on intelligence such as trends in customer behavior and product
    demand.

    are providing data warehousing solutions to better manage unstructured data, which
    may contribute toward a greater public perception of unstructured data's importance
    regarding data management. This trend in public perception may convince a greater
    number of organizations to invest in data management workflows that rely on unstructured
    and ensure the protection of customer data such as personally identifiable information
    (PII).

    reasons. Although they may seem innocuous, data silos can prevent the sharing
    of information across relevant parties and can contribute toward inconsistency
    in data across multiple departments. Some IT leaders may even feel that data silos
    make it more difficult to paint a holistic picture of a business's data when barriers
    such as data silos exist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    time soon. In light of this fact, it's important that IT leaders embrace ways
    to parse unstructured sets of data and secure it across silos without feeling
    like they need to store all of their data in a single silo.
  prefs: []

    present to search for, classify, and secure unstructured data, IT leaders should
    consider how data silos can improve tag management across data storage platforms.
    Portable data management that exists [across multiple platforms](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/management/5-storage-needs-of-modern-data-centers/)
    makes it much easier for data professionals to transfer their sets of data across
    new cloud-based environments and software solutions while holding onto tags that
    enable the rapid segmentation of data.
