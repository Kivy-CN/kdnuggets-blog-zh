    to SOTA NLP, but there seems to literally be only this one courses that takes
    a methodical, academic approach to really understanding transforms inside out,

    in and receive credit for. This is the freely-available content of the first university
    course on transformers (as far as I can tell), from Stanford instructors, under
    the tutelage of renowned NLP researcher and faculty member, Chris Manning. But
    don''t get upset; all of the course''s material is available, from readings to
    videos and beyond. If you are really interested in understanding transformers
    under the hood, this is the course for you.'

- en: Since their introduction in 2017, transformers have revolutionized Natural Language
    Processing (NLP). Now, transformers are finding applications all over Deep Learning,
    be it computer vision (CV), reinforcement learning (RL), Generative Adversarial
    Networks (GANs), Speech or even Biology. Among other things, transformers have
    enabled the creation of powerful language models like GPT-3 and were instrumental
    in DeepMind's recent AlphaFold2, that tackles protein folding.

    with attention, the concept that gave way to transformers, and move on to transformers
    themselves, then on to their NLP applications, vision transformers, pretrained
    transformers, switch transformers, and much more. You get lectures by Geoff Hinton.
    Chris Olah, Aidan Gomez, and many other knowledgeable researchers in the field.
    The course instructors are Div Garg, Chetanya Rastogi, Advay Pal, with Chris Manning,
    as previously mentioned, serving as faculty advisor.
