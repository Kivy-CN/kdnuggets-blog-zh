- en: Predictive analytics processes large amounts of data, analyzes it to find useful
    and relevant information, and then develops predictive models to provide valuable
    insights relating to different scenarios, both past and present. Thanks to these
    scenario-based insights, predictions can be made about future events, enabling
    businesses to make better decisions in terms of identifying new trends, changing
    product offerings, and more.

    to be used effectively. Analytics provides the facts and relevant data, while
    it is up to the user to identify how it can be applied to real-world, future scenarios.
    Combined, predictive analytics and decision-making processes can help businesses

    how customers may behave in the future. This can help to provide accurate forecasts

    sales funnel, checking the effectiveness of each stage, from initial awareness
    to a completed purchase. For example, algorithms could determine how many content/
    ad offerings a lead typically interacts with, and when, before ending a purchase
    or critical action. This can help to improve targeted ad campaigns in the future,
    giving insight into when a customer is more likely to interact during the customer
    lifecycle.

    them to a predictive model. This includes knowing where the data is sourced from,
    how it was gathered, and its structure. Establishing that the data used is completely
    reliable is vital to guarantee the model makes accurate and relevant predictions.

    is suited to the data being processed. Choose a single model that can be used
    across the business so that it can be easily optimized, instead of using a range
    of different models that could become complex and inefficient.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before launching the model it must be thoroughly evaluated and validated to
    make sure it is trained correctly and generates the intended results. To do this,
    test the model on a range of data sets and refine it as needed, while ensuring
    the model also uses the most up-to-date techniques and methods.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it is performing. Always thoroughly test any new data sets and take the time to
    measure the results against the latest trends and market changes based on your
    research.
