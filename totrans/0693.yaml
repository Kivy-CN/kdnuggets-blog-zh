    a well-integrated flow of information to the right part of the organization at
    the right time’. This intellectual system inherits some important features of
    its biological prototype, for instance, it ‘...blocks out the information that
    isn’t important ...’ [1] The system acts as an agent, anticipating user’s intentions
    and making some decisions by its own.

    software was made in 1993, when Knowledge Industries was purchased. Its CEO Eric
    Horvitz, spearheaded Adaptive Systems and Interactions (ASI) group at Microsoft
