    and business intelligence. In most instances, your business intelligence solution
    already uses big data analytics in some capacity. If it’s not, then that’s a huge
    blindspot you must address.

    utilize it as part of your business intelligence processes or stacks? This guide
    will answer these two questions and more. But first, let’s look at what these
    terms mean so you can better understand how and where they fit together.

    spending is set to reach [$3.4 trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/870924/worldwide-digital-transformation-market-size/)
    by 2026\. We’ve seen a growing reliance on technology, and no industry is exempt
    from this change. For example, according to a recent study [conducted by GetWeave](https://www.getweave.com/industry/dentistry/),
    98% of healthcare providers agree that technology plays a crucial role in providing
    a superior experience for customers.

    data gathering. As of 2023, at least [3,5 quintillion bytes of daily data](https://earthweb.com/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/)
    are generated globally. This large storage of raw collected data is referred to
    as big data.

    actionable insights from business data. These insights are then visualized and
    presented to company executives, allowing them to make informed decisions based
    on empirical data.

    be why big data analytics is conflated and mistaken with BI. But while business
    intelligence seeks to gain present-day success by using old and new data, business
    analytics looks at the links between present and past data to predict future data
    (the future of the business).

    current global economic climate and shopping trends. For instance, to remain competitive
    during 2022 and 2023, companies began to reduce the total units and mass they
    included in a packaged product. For example, a 500g bag of potato chips would
    be [reduced to 450g](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/are-there-fewer-chips-in-your-favorite-snack-bag-yes-and/422407)
