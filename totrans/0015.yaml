    assumed as a work of fiction. Let’s explore the various ways it is impacting the
    tech industry. As AI enters our lives in a rather seamless way – think of facial
    recognition helping unlock phones, or Alexa and Siri, enriching experience with
    voice-enabled technologies, it is truly ubiquitous.

    to help analyze medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans to diagnose the underlying
    health condition of the patient. Such advanced algorithms are adept in identifying
    patterns and anomalies, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in speeding
    up the diagnosis process and enhancing patient outcomes.

- en: It is worthwhile noting that the use of AI in healthcare qualifies under the
    high-risk and high-impact categories, hence the probabilistic output of AI models
    should only be considered as a point of augmentation. The false positives and
    false negatives could imply misdiagnosis, which if acted upon without healthcare
    professionals’ supervision, can significantly impact the lives of patients.

    potential fraud, as compared to the traditional signature-based techniques. With
    the increased use of digital banking and online payments, a minor oversight in
    detecting fraud can cause huge losses to customers, damaging the reputation of
    online platforms.

    $600 billion annually, which is 0.8% of the global GDP. Studies show that in the
    first quarter of 2021 alone, fraud attempts rose 149% over the previous year –
    fuelled, no doubt, by the post-Covid increase in online transactions. In response,
    more than half of all financial institutions have stepped up to employ AI to detect
    and prevent fraud in 2022”.

    is inevitable. Acting on such downtime, as and when it occurs, often finds companies
    unprepared, leading to extended repair times, which can be costly in terms of
    lost production, revenue, and additional expenses associated with repairing or
    replacing equipment.

    damage to the wider system, the quality of products, the safety of the process
    and facility, or other consequences from aging or failing assets, it may be important
    to build the capacity to help predict asset failure and help prevent it from occurring

    assistants. The user does not need to scramble for information and can simply
    access information at their fingertips. This accessibility to information has
    reduced the need for manual searching and bypassed the traditional customer support
    channels for many routine inquiries. These assistants have opened up new frontiers
    of efficiencies, saving users’ time and enhancing productivity.
