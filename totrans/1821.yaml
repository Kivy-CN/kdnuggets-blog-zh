- en: For those of us familiar with comic books from our childhood (or... not so long
    ago), The Avengers are Marvel Comics' premier superhero ensemble, bringing together
    otherwise independent and capable individuals of the superhuman variety to battle
    Earth's most dangerous villains, earning our gratitude and idolization forever.
    For the uninitiated, The Avengers are not actually a set crew of superheroes,
    with their membership being rather fluid and having changed dramatically over
    the years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what if, for fun (obviously), we matched up hero attributes and personalities
    with the super tools of the data science trade? Just as our heroes have their
    strengths, weaknesses, and preferences, so do data scientists. How would The Avenger
    members' individual characteristics translate to the world of analytics?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With that in mind, I have taken some liberties with putting together my own
    Avengers iteration and ascribing their personality traits to their envisioned
    super data scientist equivalents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Incidentally, **What If...** is actually the name of a long-running, if sporadic,
    series of comics in the Marvel Universe, where non-canonical and generally "fun"
    storylines are pursued which are far outside of the norm, challenging Marvel's
    status quo. This novel and unorthodox approach to story telling actually seems
    like a pretty good fit for data science. Plus, as they run out of story ideas,
    maybe a future issue imagines some of our heroes as data-oriented professionals.

    envision Steve Rogers - his real name - to be the capable Chief Data Officer of
    Avengers, Inc. He may not be hands-on any longer, but he came up in the rough
    scrabble world of data munging, so he gets the everyday struggle the data scientists
    working under him go through.

    Hulk is definitely that data scientist who would try to solve every problem using

    is in his way and reduces the rubble.'

    Banner form, he's very insightful and sees value in all of the things, but when
    challenged by the task at hand he reverts to what he knows best.

    Tony Stark (Iron Man's alter ego), I would think that Iron Man would prefer to
    make use of the consummate data science tool of flexibility. As such, Iron Man
    is a Python kinda guy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Munge data? Run some analysis? Whip up a classifier using libraries? Implement
    some neural nets from scratch? Build and scale a production-ready system? Python
    can really do all of this. Tony loves a prototype, too, and name a programming
    language preferred by data scientists that can do all of this. No, that other
    one can't.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, if Iron Man only developed production systems then he would probably
    grab a book on C++, but he prides himself in being a Tony of All Trades, and so
    he understands the value of Python.

    algorithmic approach is capable of solving all of his problems. But he understands
    the power of a single framework running atop arguably the strongest data processing
    engine in the universe as a central piece in his problem-solving approach. Also,
    he is very focused when he works, and never allows anyone to pick up his keyboard.

    different times. Peter Parker, his alter ego, is a studious young man with the
    gift of high intelligence. His scientific mind wants to solve problems of consequence,
    and is not interested in the petty, necessary practicalities which facilitate
    this ambition.
  prefs: []

- en: Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is an analyst's analyst. He isn't really
    concerned with building production systems or implementing his own algorithms,
    and as such software is merely a tool for him to use to gain insight and solve
    problems. R is his tool of choice, since it is built for exactly what he needs,
    nothing more. He doesn't mind that learning R is wrought with confusion, since
    he does not come from a computer science background and is unencumbered by the
    knowledge of how other programming languages are implemented.

    the entire universe. He uses magic to mystify his foes, confounding them while
    solving problems. In this sense, it seems that Dr. Strange would be an advocate
    of blackbox algorithms. Better yet, as Sorcerer Supreme, and the most powerful
    entity in the Marvel Universe, not really understood by anyone else, perhaps he
    would **only** use blackbox algorithms.
  prefs: []

    Avenger is to perform automated machine learning to help the others. Vision takes
    a hybrid Bayesian and genetic algorithm approach to feature selection and model
    building, performing training and testing on vast numbers of models in parallel
    in order to come up with the most accurate results and help point the other team
    members in the right direction.
