- en: In the 1970s, **Edgar F. Codd** proposed the relational database model, commonly
    known as SQL databases. These databases are mainly designed for handling structured
    data having relational models. They can handle transactional data, which involves
    storing and manipulating data in tables with predefined schemas. Famous examples
    of SQL databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Server.

    volume of data increased, and the need for different data types became more diverse
    to the point where SQL databases struggled. In addition to that, they are complicated
    for horizontal scaling, which makes them not suitable for handling large amounts
    of data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To cater to these limitations of SQL databases, in the early 2000s, NoSQL databases
    came into the picture. They are document-oriented databases and use fast key-value
    pairs to store data. They are capable of parsing data from the documents and storing
    that data under keys rather than defining strict tables of information, unlike
    SQL databases.

- en: NoSQL databases have now become mainstream and provide various advantages over
    SQL databases. But it does not necessarily mean that NoSQL databases are better
    than SQL.  Both SQL and NoSQL databases serve different purposes and use different
    approaches to data management. One is used for relational data, and the other
    is for non-relational data. SQL databases are still in use where there is a need
    to run complex queries, and the database schema is well-defined. Famous examples
    are MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4J and Redis.

- en: It means that data can be dynamically added or removed without changing the
    structure of the original database. It means unlike SQL databases, they don't
    require rigid schemas. They are designed to handle any data format structured,
    semi-structured or unstructured. This gives freedom for the developers to focus
    on the application development rather than worrying about the database schema.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NoSQL databases support horizontal scaling, which means we can scale it by adding
    more servers instead of increasing the capacity of a single server. This makes
    it more powerful to handle large numbers of requests.

    very low latency and almost zero downtime to its users. Also, they divide the
    traffic among themselves to reduce the burden on a single server.

    generated. They have a faster query response time and support database sharding,
    improving their overall performance.

- en: This is the most flexible NoSQL database. It requires a key-value pair for storing
    data. A key can be a unique attribute, like an id, that corresponds to a particular
    value. The application has control to store any type of data in the value field.
    These are suitable for real-time applications, caching, or session management.
    Redis and Riak are famous examples of key-value databases.

    customer-related data like orders, user profiles, and product catalogs are generated
    daily. Due to its low latency and quick processing, it is suitable for real-time
    inventory management and handling high traffic.

    This is most suitable for storing semi-structured or unstructured data, where
    there is no need to specify the document's fields explicitly. MongoDB is a famous
    example of a document-oriented database.

    website. Data in the form of articles, comments, categories, and tags can be stored
    and retrieved quickly. Document-based data is suitable for storing unstructured
    data like texts, images, links, etc. Also, its flexible schema behaviour allows
    easy changes in the data model.

    to each other. They store data in the form of nodes and edges and are used to
    represent complex relationships between objects. It is best suitable for social
    media applications and for creating recommendation engines. Famous examples are
    Neo4J and InfoGrid.

- en: In this type of NoSQL database, the data is stored in column families. Similar
    types of data are grouped into cells and stored in columns of data instead of
    rows. A column can even contain multiple rows and columns inside it, which have
    their own unique id.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a traditional SQL database, the query executes row by row. But in the columnar
    database, the query executes only for the specific column we want. This saves
    time and makes it suitable for handling large datasets. They may look like a SQL
    database, as they involve some form of schema management and function the same
    way as relational table works. But they are far more flexible and efficient than
    SQL databases, making them in the NoSQL databases category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Popular examples of columnar databases are Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra.
