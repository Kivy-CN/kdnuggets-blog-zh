    web deployment? Do I need to learn Flask or Django for web applications? Do I

- en: When I started my journey to learn data science, those were the questions that
    I always had in my mind. My intention to learn data science was not only to develop
    models or clean data. I wanted to make applications that people can use them.
    I was looking for a fast way to make MVPs (minimum viable products) to test my
    ideas.

    in this article, I show you 7 Python libraries that you need to learn to make
    your first application. I am sure you already know some of them, but I mention
    them here for those unfamiliar with them.

- en: Data science and machine learning application are all about data. Most datasets
    are not clean, and they need some sort of cleaning and manipulation for your project.
    Pandas is a library that lets you load, clean, and manipulates your data. You
    may use alternatives like SQL for data manipulation and database management, but
    Pandas is much easier and more applicable for you as a data scientist who wants
    to be a developer (or at least MVP developer) as well.

    arrays, manipulate them, and efficiently apply algorithms to them. Learning Numpy
    is necessary to work with some other libraries that I mention later.

- en: Neural networks, especially deep neural network models, are very popular models
    in data science and machine learning. Many computer vision and natural language
    processing methods rely on these methods. Several Python libraries provide you
    access to neural network tools. TensorFlow is the most famous one, but I believe
    it is difficult for beginners to start with TensorFlow. Instead, I suggest you
    learn Keras, which is an interface (API) for Tensorflow. Keras makes it easy for
    you as a human to test different neural network architectures and even build your
    own. The other option which is getting popular recently is PyTorch.

- en: Nowadays, many data science applications are working with APIs (Application
    Programming Interfaces). In simple words, through an API, you can request a server
    application to give you access to a database or do a specific task for you. For
    example, Google Map API can get two locations from you and return travel time
    between them. Without APIs, you must reinvent wheels. Requests is a library to
    talk to APIs. Nowadays, it is hard to be a data scientist without using APIs.

    Although the most popular plotting library in Python is matplotlib, I found Plotly
    more professional, easy to use, and flexible. The types of plots and mapping tools
    in Plotly are enormous. The other nice thing about Plotly is its design. It looks
    more user-friendly compared to matplotlib graphs, which have a scientific look.

- en: You must choose between the traditional-looking user interface and web-based
    user interfaces when it comes to the user interface. You can build traditional-looking
    user interfaces using libraries like PyQT or TkInter. But my suggestion is to
    make web-looking applications (if possible) that can run on browsers. To make
    it happen, you need to work with a library that gives you a set of widgets in
    the browser. ipywidgets has a rich set of widgets for Jupyter Notebook.

- en: The last tools that you need to learn to make your first data science application
    are the easiest ones. First, ipywidgets works in Jupyter Notebook, and you need
    to use Jupyter to make your application. I am sure many of you already use Jupyter
    Notebook for your model building and exploratory analysis. Now, think about Jupyter
    Notebook as a tool for front-end development. Also, you need to use Voila, a third-party
    tool that you can launch, and it hides all the code parts from Jupyter Notebook.
    When you launch a Jupyter Notebook application via Voila, it is like a web application.
    Even you can run the Voila and Jupyter Notebook on an AWS EC2 machine and access
    your simple application from the internet.

- en: Using the 7 libraries that I mentioned in this article, you can build data science
    applications that people use. By becoming a master in using these tools, you can
    build MVPs in a few hours and test your idea with real users. Later, if you decided
    to scale up your application, you can use more professional tools like Flask and
    Django in addition to HTML, CSS, and JS codes.
