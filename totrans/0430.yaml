- en: The first step while starting the Data Science Journey is to get familiar with
    a programming language. Between the two, Python is the most preferred coding language
    and is adopted by most Data Scientists. It is easy to understand, versatile, and
    supports various in-built libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn,
    Scipy, and many more.
