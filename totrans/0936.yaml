- en: Analytics is often associated with understanding why a particular event happened
    by analyzing historical data. It is more of a diagnostic approach to finding out
    the reasons for what happened in the past. With the advent of more advanced and
    sophisticated algorithms, analytics has graduated to a forward-looking approach.
    This prognostic approach learns the associations from past data to predict future
    trends and behavior. Such predictive foresight enables business leaders to calibrate
    their decisions and take the right course of action in line with such predictions.

- en: Let us understand how analytics can be used to learn customer behavior with
    the help of an example. Search engine marketing requires competitors to bid for
    their advertisements to land an impression on the search result page. The caveat
    is to not bid consistently high for all the advertisements across all the regions
    (we will instead use a generalized form of regions called campaigns through the
    rest of the post). Typically, the business identifies certain campaigns as more
    ROI-generating ones than others, hence it would be more cost-effective to design
    an optimized bidding strategy for different campaigns.

- en: The bid optimization algorithm improves sales as increased impressions lead
    to more potential clicks which in turn generate conversions. Besides, such an
    optimization tool brings cost savings by identifying customized bids per campaign
    instead of one static uniform bid across multiple campaigns. Such analytics projects
    have the potential to bring a significant positive nudge to the bottom line of
    the organization.

- en: Drawing from the use case explained above, if an organization is able to bid
    in an effective and efficient manner, then they successfully pass the first stage
    of landing the impressions. The users click on these impressions and enter the
    web property of the organization’s ecosystem. The whole new journey of engaging
    the user starts from here. You have very little time to understand what the user
    is looking for and serve their requirements and preferences at blazing-fast speed.
    Amid the rapid rate of digitalization, it does not take a customer drop-off from
    one application and switch to another platform.

    A happy customer is a repeat customer and vice versa. It takes a lot of hard work
    to acquire a customer, it would be a nightmare to not be able to devise a successful
    customer retention strategy. Needless to say, it is more expensive to acquire
    a customer than to retain one. Businesses understand this very well, hence they
    want to tap into every single insight that analytics can empower them with, so
    as to provide a better experience to current customers.

    better offers and services that would make a long-standing relationship with your

    It extends to the fact that the new customer acquisition costs seven times more
    than retaining an old one. Further, it states that the probability of generating
    conversions from an existing customer is 60-70% which is significantly greater
    than the probability of 5-20% from a new customer.

    of business strategy, the leaders understand the gap in current technology and
    expend money to build up the necessary infrastructure to run sophisticated models.
    However, the top-down approach to the adoption of new technology is not as easy
    to execute as it may sound. It requires an initial hand-holding phase where a
    technology expert assists the team in a quick and easy ramp-up.
