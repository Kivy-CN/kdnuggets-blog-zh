- en: The upcoming holiday season provides the ideal opportunity to make an impression
    as a data professional. It’s a busy time of year, and given the field’s recent
    growth, company leaders may be looking to promote some workers in 2022\. If you
    impress now, you can move to the next step in your career before long.

    to achieve that isn’t always clear. In that spirit, here are five ways you can
    impress your company leadership.

- en: The difference between a junior and senior data professional is often more about
    business acumen than technical expertise. Those who succeed in the field understand
    why companies are interested in data science and how to deliver in those areas.
    The holiday season is also an excellent time to showcase that understanding.

    adopted a new shopping behavior. Retail companies will need to adapt to these
    changes this holiday shopping season, and you can help serve that need through
    data. Enriching first-party data with third-party data and making sense of the
    results will help these partners succeed amid these shifts.

    results and impress customers. These results will, in turn, impress your boss.
    Showcasing how you can deliver tangible business benefits from data demonstrates
    your value as an employee.

    operations. Data analysis and science often involve a lot of manual work. For
    example, up to [80% of AI project time](https://rehack.com/featured/how-do-the-companies-involved-in-artificial-intelligence-succeed/)
    goes towards labeling and preparing data. All of this slow, manual work leaves

    compare them to which deliver the most value. As you compare these factors, you
    may find ways to adjust workflows to improve team efficiency. You can even try
    implementing these changes in some of your own tasks to see how they work.

    This demonstrates initiative and care for the company’s bottom line, which leaders
    will look for in a senior employee.

- en: Another way to deliver value to your company this holiday season is to look
    for potential new customers. Data science is a rapidly growing field, so many
    businesses in traditionally non-data-centric industries will now be interested
    in these services. Reaching out to these companies could gain your company new
    clients.

    Data analytics can help fleets save fuel, reduce equipment downtime, and more,
    yet integrating data into these operations is a relatively new trend. You can
    look into companies in this field or those like it to find new customers for your
    company.

    will doubtless appreciate. Taking the initiative to reach out will make you stand
    out this holiday season.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While soft skills and business knowledge are often the most significant factors
    in progressing in data science, technical skills are still important. If you take
    the time to hone your data talents outside of work on personal projects, you can
    impress your management.

- en: Gaining new certifications in your free time can demonstrate initiative and
    respect for the field. This also shows your boss that you take advancing in your
    career seriously. You can emphasize these factors by looking for personal projects
    that are still relevant to your company’s niche and goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One important aspect of these projects to focus on is how you present your progress
    to your seniors. Data science managers say they [want people who can communicate
    concisely](/2018/01/how-grow-data-scientist.html) for senior data scientist positions.
    If you can present your personal projects concisely and clearly, you can demonstrate
    what your management is after.

    data science trends. This is a new and developing field, so staying abreast of
    these changes can be critical to a business’s success. If you can show your boss
    that you stay up to date on these developments, you can leave a lasting impression.
  prefs: []

    organizations or data science forums. If you notice any growing or promising trends,
    bring them up around company leadership, either in casual conversation or relevant
    meetings. If you show that you understand these developments beyond knowing buzzwords,
    you may impress them.
