    I wanted to become both a freelancer and a “real ML engineer” at the same time.

    gaming company famous for having Mourinho’s face on its flagship game: TopEleven.
    My Machine Learning adventure at Nordeus consisted of designing and implementing
    an intelligent system to help the customer support team resolve player issues
    faster. The essence of it was to build a text classifier from a ton of historical
    player tickets and agent resolutions.'

    and access to GPUs. On paper, everything seemed just right for me to shine and
    deliver a great model and an even greater solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this never happened. To my despair, it took me more than a month to realize
    that the dataset I was trying to use to train my supervised model was as bad as
    it could be. Before getting to this realization, I had spent uncountable hours
    and Jupyter notebooks trying to make this whole thing work. I was so busy working
    that I could not find time to look at the data. We could say my lack of experience
    didn’t help.

- en: Three months after this failed project, I decided to quit my job and start my
    freelance path at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/Bxdpg6/worlds-top-talent). After
    a couple of rounds of interviews and technical screening, I got to the last round.
    Guess what? I had to solve a machine learning assignment. Almost identical to
    the one I had failed previously. And I had a week to complete it.

    during that week. The long shadow of the impostor syndrome was obfuscating my
    mind.

    Three years and 10 projects later, I might say I am handling the impostor syndrome
    much better.

    in quarterly or yearly reviews. It comes every single day. And there is no way
    to hack that. Clients expect you to deliver quality and fast. By the way, this
    is the main reason why you will be better paid than in your current job.

    Test yourself. You are smart, and you can do it. Taking more online courses does
    not make the impostor syndrome go away. Believe me.

    (capital letters, yes).
  prefs: []

- en: 'Rare are the occasions when you are given a clean and complete set of features
    and labels to build your ML model. Instead, you often need to generate the training
    data yourself. The most common problems I have faced in this sense are:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The training data has a bug**. Usually, you generate this data from an SQL
    query and some kind of Python script to automate the extraction of raw features
    and labels. Writing SQL queries is simple, but debugging them can get pretty hard.
    Working on your SQL skills is one of the best things you can do to become a better
    ML engineer.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The training data is incomplete**. After generating the first version of
    your training data, you jump to the next phase of ML development and build a quick
    baseline model. More often than not, this baseline model is not good enough to
    solve the business problem, and so you need to iterate. Non-experienced ML developers
    tend to focus too much on improving the model and forget about the dataset they
    created. This is a typical mistake that causes frustration and impostor syndrome
    kind of feelings. Go back to the DATA. Extend your SQL query to add more relevant
    features. Talk to domain experts in your environment (data engineers, business
    intelligence guys…) that can help you fetch the data that will move the needle
    and unblock you.'

    to colossal Transformer models. If the fuel is not ok, it does not matter which
    car you are driving. You are not going to move.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This sounds so trivial and stupid that we (I include myself) ML engineers have
    a surprising tendency to forget. As you get more experience building ML solutions,
    you get better at remembering this and going back to the DATA whenever you hit
    a wall.

    you need to change your mindset. You have to behave as a problem-solver. You need
    to get to know the dataset, and the best way is to visualize it. I personally
    love Tableau Desktop, but there are other options out there like Power BI, Apache
    Superset, etc. There are even Python libraries if you prefer, like [sweetviz](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz).
