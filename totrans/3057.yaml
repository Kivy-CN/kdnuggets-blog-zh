    any of the introductory material what I have already covered, but if interested
    in running down the main points, as well as a foray into the practical, feel free
    to peruse these articles before moving on.

    these automated steps, is incidental to the automated machine learning process,
    while automated steps such as model evaluation and model selection are ancillary
    to the core. See Figure 1.

    an automated machine learning pipeline of your very own, or automate particular
    aspects of a machine learning pipeline with respect to the 2 overarching tasks
    outlined above?

    learning as a discipline, may not yet be fully formed, but neither is it totally
    undeveloped at this point. See below for a sampling of open source tools which
    can help with fleshing out an automated machine learning pipeline of your very
    own.

    search) which are generally considered to be "automated machine learning tools"
    in a broad sense. However, note that the hyperparameter tuning & architecture
    search tools can and often do also perform some type of feature selection. There
    is a strong set of tools which provide only automated feature engineering and/or
    selection (caution that your definition of automated may not jive in one of those
    particular cases), and so a sampling of those tools are also presented.

    (AutoML). It is developed by DATA Lab at Texas A&M University and community contributors.
    The ultimate goal of AutoML is to provide easily accessible deep learning tools
    to domain experts with limited data science or machine learning background. Auto-Keras
    provides functions to automatically search for architecture and hyperparameters
    of deep learning models.

    for a scikit-learn estimator. auto-sklearn frees a machine learning user from
    algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. It leverages recent advantages
    in Bayesian optimization, meta-learning and ensemble construction. Learn more
    about the technology behind auto-sklearn by reading our paper published at NIPS
    2015.
