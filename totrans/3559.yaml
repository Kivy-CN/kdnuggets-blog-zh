    learning concepts. Below is a list I find most illuminating.

- en: 3\. **Occam's razor** [ITILA](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/) Figure
    28.3. This figure gives the basic intuition for why complex models can turn out
    to be less probable. The horizontal axis represents the space of possible data
    sets D. Bayes’ theorem rewards models in proportion to how much they predicted
    the data that occurred. These predictions are quantified by a normalized probability
    distribution on D. This probability of the data given model Hi, P (D | Hi), is
    called the evidence for Hi. A simple model H1 makes only a limited range of predictions,
    shown by P(D|H1); a more powerful model H2, that has, for example, more free parameters
    than H1, is able to predict a greater variety of data sets. This means, however,
    that H2 does not predict the data sets in region C1 as strongly as H1\. Suppose
    that equal prior probabilities have been assigned to the two models. Then, if
    the data set falls in region C1, the less powerful model H1 will be the more probable
    model.

    **Irrelevant features:** Why irrelevant features hurt kNN, clustering, and other
    similarity based methods? The figure above on the left shows two classes well
    separated on the vertical axis. The figure above on the right adds an irrelevant
    horizontal axis which destroys the grouping and makes many points nearest neighbors
    of the opposite class.'
