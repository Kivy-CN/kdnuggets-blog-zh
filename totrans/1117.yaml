- en: In the data science industry, it is not enough to be a skilled data scientist
    — you need to sell your project and yourself. The first step of selling an idea
    or yourself is developing a solid elevator pitch that provides your value proposition
    and how your project is different from others. In this blog post, we will discuss
    how elevator pitches work, what goes into them, and examples of elevator pitches
    for data scientists.

- en: You’ve been stuck in an elevator with an executive, and you only get 15 seconds
    to make a good first impression of yourself and your project. What do you say?
    You are at a networking event, and one of the industry leaders asks you to tell
    her about your project. Can you describe your project/product in a concise and
    compelling way?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In your mind, what you want to say is that “you are about to embark on an adventure
    with me that will change your life forever. I am the answer for all of those questions
    you’ve been asking yourself, and more importantly, you need a partner who understands
    exactly what you need”. Right? But we know that this doesn’t really come out right.
    You have 15 seconds to grab their attention. We need to be able to deliver a tightly
    developed elevator pitch.

- en: 2\. Why do you need to know how to give a good elevator pitch
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should learn how to deliver an effective elevator pitch for your projects
    for two reasons. First, you may want to present a project at work or during an
    interview. Second, it’s good practice in writing concise descriptions of complicated
    subjects and ideas — which is exactly what data scientists do! You might not think
    that knowing how to sell yourself makes you any more effective at doing your job,
    but elevator pitches are great practice for giving presentations and making data
    science projects sound appealing to others.

    pitch. However, I believe we should approach it systematically, meaning the formula
    should be based on evidence and research. Thus, this formula is from the Marketing
    research area…. they know how to market!!
