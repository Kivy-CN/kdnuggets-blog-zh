    useful for time-series sensor data analysis. A quick introduction about time-series
    data is also provided. The demo notebook can be found on [here](https://github.com/ajayarunachalam/msda)

- en: Time series data is information taken at a particular duration. For instance,
    having a set of sensor data observed at particular equal paces, each sensor can
    be classified as time series. If the data is collected without any order in time,
    or at once, it is not time series data.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time Series Data is composed of collection of data of one specific variable
    at particular interval of time. On the other hand, Cross-Section Data is consist
    of collection of data on multiple variables from different sources at a particular
    interval of time. Collection of company’s stock market data at regular interval
    of year is an example of time series data. But when the collection of company’s
    sales revenue, sales volume is collected for the past 3 months then it is taken
    as an example of cross-section data. Time series data is mainly used for obtaining
    results over an extended period of time, but cross-section data focuses on the
    information received from surveys at a particular time.

    data analysis & experiments. It enables users to perform end-to-end proof-of-concept
    experiments quickly and efficiently. The module identifies events in the multidimensional
    time series by capturing the variation and trend to establish relationships aimed
    towards identifying the correlated features helping in feature selection from
    raw sensor signals.

    ([personal website](https://sites.google.com/site/ajayarunachalamprofile/)) is
    a Postdoctoral Researcher (Artificial Intelligence) at Centre for Applied Autonomous
    Sensor Systems, Orebro University, Sweden. Prior to this, he was working as a
    Data Scientist at True Corporation, a Communications Conglomerate, working with
    Petabytes of data, building & deploying deep models in production. He truly believes
    that Opacity in AI systems is need of the hour, before we fully accept the power
    of AI. With this in mind, he has always strived to democratize AI, and be more
    inclined towards building Interpretable Models. His interest is in Applied Artificial
    Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Deep RL, and Natural Language Processing,
    specifically learning good representations. From his experience working on real-world
    problems, he fully acknowledges that finding good representations is the key in
    designing the system that can solve interesting challenging real-world problems,
    that go beyond human-level intelligence, and ultimately explain complicated data
    for us that we don''t understand. In order to achieve this, he envisions learning
    algorithms that can learn feature representations from both unlabelled and labelled
    data, be guided with and/or without human interaction, and that are on different
    levels of abstractions in order to bridge the gap between low-level data and high-level
    abstract concepts.'
