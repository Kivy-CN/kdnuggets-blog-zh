- en: 3D charts have one huge disadvantage. When creating a 3D chart, you can visualize
    data from different angles/scales, or use an interactive library for that, so
    you’ll able to understand data quite well. However, when created, these charts
    are hard to share.

- en: People usually convert 3D charts into a single static image or a set of images
    taken from different angles and with different scales. With such an approach some
    important information may be lost, or hard to understand, so we need a better
    option. And it does exist.

- en: In this short tutorial, I’ll show you how to create an interactive 3D chart
    and easily share it which anyone – no matter, they are data scientists, developers,
    managers, or even your non-technical friends that don’t have any coding environment
    installed. And the shared chart will be fully interactive as well.

    an open-source library that allows creating interactive charts in Jupyter Notebooks.
    I’ve used this library for a while and also shared the charts as static images
    until my college showed me a great `plotly` feature:'

    they are fully interactive.

- en: Let’s create a visualization of a simple 3D function – parabola. First, we calculate
    function values on a grid (x,y) with `numpy.meshgrid`. Then we use `plotly` to
    plot the surface and save it as HTML file. Below is a code for that (based on [documentation](https://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/)).

- en: And here is how the result looks like. This HTML file can be opened in any browser,
    embedded on the website, and sent via messengers. The best thing here is that
    to open this file – neither Jupyter Notebook nor `plotly` library is needed.

- en: I remember `plotly` being an overcomplicated library with very limited functionality,
    but within last years it grew up in something really cool within last years. For
    instance, there are 13 types of 3D charts available, and dozens of maps, statistics,
    scientific and financial 2D charts.

    how to install it and build your first chart. Worth trying for sure!
