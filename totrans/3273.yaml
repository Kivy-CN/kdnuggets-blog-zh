    percentage, but errors can be of a different kind**, that humans would never make,
    such as classify a toothbrush as a baseball bat. This difference with humans **it
    can be used as malicious AI hacking**, for ex. painting small “adversarial” changes
    over street signals, unnoticeable by humans, but dramatically confusing for self-driving
    cars.

- en: '**The AI will kill old jobs, but create new ML-trainer jobs**, similar to puppy
    trainers, not to engineers. An ML is harder to train than a puppy, since (unlike
    the puppy) it lacks general intelligence, and so it learns everything it spots
    in data, without any selection or common sense. A puppy it would think twice before
    to learn evil things, such as killing friends. Instead, for an ML it makes no
    difference to serve terrorists or hospitals, and it will not explain why it took
    the decisions. An ML will not apology for errors or fear to be powered off for
    errors: it’s not sentient general AI. For safety and quality standards, each ML
    will be surrounded by many humans, skilled in: ML training, ML testing, but also
    in trying to interpret the ML decisions and ethics. All at once, in a same job
    title.'

- en: '**Practical ML training**. If you train with photos of objects held by a hand,
    the ML will include the hand as part of the objects, failing to recognize the
    objects alone. A dog knows how to eat from a hand, the dumb ML eats your hand
    too. To fix, train on hands alone, then on objects alone, finally on objects held
    by hands, labeled as “object x held by hand”. Same with object changes: a car
    without wheels or deformed by an accident, an house in ruins etc. Any human knows
    it’s a car crashed in a wall, a bombed house etc. An ML sees unknown new objects,
    unless you teach piece by piece, case by case. Including weather! If you train
    with photos all taken in sunny days, tests will work with other sunny days photos,
    but not with photos of same things took in cloudy days. The ML learned to classify
    based on sunny or cloudy weather, not just on the objects. A dog knows that the
    task is to tell what’s the object whatever it’s seen in sunny or cloudy light.
    Instead, an ML picks all the subtle clues: you need to teach all 100% explicitly.'

- en: '**Copyright and intellectual property laws will need updates**: MLs, like humans,
    can invent new things. An ML is shown existing things A and B, and produces C,
    a new, original thing. If C is different enough from both A and B, and from anything
    else on earth, C it can be patented as invention or artwork. Who is the author?
    Further, what if A and B it was patented or copyrighted material? When C is very
    different, the A and B authors can’t guess that C exists thanks to their A and
    B. Let’s say it is not legal to train MLs on recent copyrighted paintings, music,
    architecture, design, chemical formulas, perhaps stolen user data etc. Then, how
    do you guess the data sources used from just the ML results, when less recognizable
    than a Picasso style transfer? How you will know an ML was used at all? Many people
    will use MLs in secret, claiming results as their own.'

- en: '**For most tasks in small companies, it will keep cheaper to train humans than
    MLs**. It’s easy to teach a human to drive, but epic to teach the same to an ML.
    It needs to tell and let crash the ML in millions of handcrafted examples of all
    the road situations. After, perhaps the ML will be safer than any human driver,
    especially those drunk, sleepy, watching cell phone screens, ignoring speed limits
    or simply mad. **But a so expensive and reliable training is viable for big companies
    only**. MLs trained in cheap way will be faulty and dangerous, only a few companies
    will be able to deliver reliable MLs. A trained ML can be copied in no time, unlike
    a brain’s experience transfer to another brain. Big providers will sell pre-trained
    MLs for reusable common tasks, for ex. “radiologist ML”. The ML will complement
    one human expert, who keeps required, and replace just the “extra” staff. An hospital
    will hire a single radiologist to oversee the ML, rather than dozen(s) of radiologists.
    The radiologist job it is not extinct, just there will be fewer per hospital.
    Who trained the ML will get back the investment by selling to many hospitals.
    The cost of training an ML will decrease every year, as more people will learn
    how to train MLs. But due to data preparation and tests, reliable ML training
    will never end up cheap. Many tasks can be automated in theory, but in practice
    only a few will be worth the ML setup costs. For too uncommon tasks like ufologists,
    translators from ancient (dead) languages, etc., **long term human salaries will
    keep cheaper** than the one-time cost of training an ML to replace too few people.'

- en: '**Humans will keep doing general AI tasks, out of ML reach**. The intelligence
    quotient (IQ) tests are wrong: they fail to predict the people’s success in life
    because there are many different intelligences (visual, verbal, logical, interpersonal
    etc.): these cooperate in a mix, but results can’t be quantified with a single
    IQ number from 0 to *n*. We define insects as “stupid” compared to human IQ, but
    mosquitoes win us all the time at the narrow “bite and escape” task. Every month,
    AIs beat humans at more narrow tasks, like mosquitoes. Waiting for the “singularity”
    moment, when AI would beat us at everything, it’s silly. We are getting many narrow
    singularities, and once AI wins us at a task, everyone except who oversees the
    AI, can quit doing the task. I read around that humans can keep doing unique handcrafted
    stuff with imperfections, but really, AIs can do fake errors, learning to craft
    different imperfections per piece, too. It’s impossible to predict what tasks
    will be won by AI next, being AI sort of creative, but it will lack “general intelligence”.
    For ex. comedians and politicians (interchangeably) are safe, despite not requiring
    special (narrow) studies or degrees: they just can talk about anything in funny
    or convincing way. If you specialize in a difficult, but narrow and common task
    (like, radiologist), MLs will be trained to replace you. Keep general!'
