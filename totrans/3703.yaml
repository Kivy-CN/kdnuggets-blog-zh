    using One Hot, Label, and Ordinal encoder. You were working with data that have
    only one label per sample. But how do you deal with samples with multiple labels?

    multi-label. Furthermore, we will apply Scikit-Learn’s MultiLabelBinarizer function
    to convert iterable of iterables and multilabel targets.

    classes, and each sample is assigned one label. Whereas in multi-label classification,
    each sample is assigned multiple labels.

    there are more than 2 classes. The students can only have either Math, Science,
    or English as a major.
