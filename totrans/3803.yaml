- en: The [StarCoder](https://huggingface.co/blog/starcoder) is a cutting-edge large
    language model designed specifically for code. With an impressive 15.5B parameters
    and an extended context length of 8K, it excels in infilling capabilities and
    facilitates fast large-batch inference through multi-query attention.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: StarCoderBase was trained on a vast dataset of 1 trillion tokens derived from
    [The Stack](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack). This collection
    consists of permissively licensed GitHub repositories, accompanied by inspection
    tools and an opt-out process for privacy-conscious developers. To further enhance
    its performance, the BigCode team meticulously fine-tuned StarCoderBase using
    35B Python tokens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result, StarCoder emerges as a powerful and refined language model equipped
    to handle a wide range of coding tasks with remarkable proficiency.

- en: StarCoderBase surpasses all existing open-source code language models that offer
    support for multiple programming languages and demonstrates exceptional performance,
    even outshining the renowned OpenAI code-cushman-001 model in terms of quality
    and results. Moreover, StarCoder can be prompted to achieve 40% pass@1 on HumanEval.
    It outperforms LaMDA, LLaMA, and PaLM models.

- en: In my opinion, it is a great tool for code completion, especially for Python
    code. However, it does have some drawbacks, such as outdated APIs, hallucinations,
    displaying Jupyter Notebook metadata, and incomplete code.

- en: The best way to generate code with StarCoder is to use well-explained comments.
    It will help the model to better understand what you are trying to do and generate
    more accurate results.
