- en: The concept of machine learning dates back to the 1950s, with the development
    of early artificial intelligence (AI) systems and the introduction of algorithms
    for training models from data. However, the first machine learning libraries as
    we know them today, which provide tools and frameworks for implementing and training
    machine learning models, did not appear until the 1980s and 1990s.

    which was developed at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s. This library provided
    tools for statistical analysis and machine learning, including support for decision
    trees and neural networks.

    developed at the University of Waikato in New Zealand in the 1990s, and the LIBSVM
    library developed at the National Taiwan University in the late 1990s. These libraries
    provided tools for a variety of machine learning tasks, including classification,
    regression, and clustering.

- en: In programming, a library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used
    in a program to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Libraries are often provided
    as a way for programmers to reuse code that has already been written and tested,
    rather than having to write all of the code from scratch every time it is needed.
