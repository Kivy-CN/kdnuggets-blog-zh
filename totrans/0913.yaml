    different learning patterns when taking in data. It is a form of intuitive learning,
    to help the model learn the patterns in the given dataset, known as training the
    model.

    not seen before. You want to achieve an optimum performance level where the model
    can produce accurate outputs on both the training and testing dataset.

    your dataset into two: the training dataset and the testing dataset. The first
    split of the data will be used to train the model, whilst the second split of
    the data will be used to test the model.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the validation set method comes with drawbacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model will have learnt all the patterns in the training dataset, but it
    may have missed out on relevant information in the testing dataset. This has caused
    the model to be deprived of important information that can improve its overall
    performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another drawback is that the training dataset may face outliers or errors in
    the data, which the model will learn. This becomes part of the model's knowledge
    base and will be applied when testing in the second phase.

- en: What is Resampling?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Resampling is a method that involves repeatedly drawing samples from the training
    dataset. These samples are then used to refit a specific model to retrieve more
    information about the fitted model. The aim is to gather more information about
    a sample and improve the accuracy and estimate the uncertainty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you’re looking at linear regression fits and want to examine
    the variability. You will repeatedly use different samples from the training data
    and fit a linear regression to each of the samples. This will allow you to examine
    how the results differ based on the different samples, as well as obtain new information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The significant advantage of resampling is that you can repeatedly draw small
    samples from the same population till your model achieves its optimum performance.
    You will save a lot of time and money by being able to recycle the same dataset,
    and not having to find new data.

    you can use to help with it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    more balance.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over-sampling is when you duplicate random samples from the minority class due
    to insufficient data collected.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, these come with drawbacks. Removing samples in under-sampling can lead
    to a loss of information. Duplicating random samples from the minority class can
    lead to overfitting.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will come across datasets that don’t follow the typical normal distribution.
    Therefore, the Bootstrap method can be applied to examine the hidden information
    and distribution of the data set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using the bootstrapping method, the samples that are drawn are replaced
    and the data that are not included in the samples are used to test the model.
    It is a flexible statistical method that can help data scientists and machine
    learning engineers quantify uncertainty.

    Aggregation, which combines bootstrapping and aggregation to form one ensemble
    model. It creates multiple sets of the original training data, which is then aggregated
    to conclude a final prediction. Each model learns the previous model's errors.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you repeatedly split the dataset randomly, it can lead to the sample ending
    up in either the training or test sets. This can unfortunately have an unbalanced
    influence on your model from making accurate predictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to avoid this, you can use K-Fold Cross Validation to split the data
    more effectively. In this process, the data is divided into k equal sets, where
    one set is defined as the test set whilst the rest of the sets are used in training
    the model. The process will continue till each set has acted as the test set and
    all the sets have gone through the training phase.
  prefs: []

    - 10 equal sets.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the first iteration, the model is trained on (k-1) and tested on the
    one remaining set. For example, the model is trained on (10-1 = 9) and tested
    on the remaining 1 set.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in the testing phase.

    the data has been used to improve the model’s learning as well as test the model's
    performance.

    information as possible, in an effective way. The only way to ensure that the
    model has successfully learned is to train the model on a variety of data points
    in the dataset.
