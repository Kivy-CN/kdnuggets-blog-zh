    It’s a platform-independent, useful, and robust language. Developers across the
    world use Java to build applications, web tools, and software development platforms.
    Java also has significant uses in machine learning and data science.'

    to a recent survey, [only 21% of people in data science use Java,](http://businessoverbroadway.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/programming_languages_used.png)
    way less than Python (83%), or SQL (44%). Most people use Python for its REPL
    capabilities and quick algorithm experimentation. Meanwhile, developers use R
    for data visualization and representation.

    of other services to create a business application. As mentioned above, Java has
    many uses in the machine learning and artificial intelligence domain. Many big
    companies like Uber, Spotify, and Airbnb are based on Java. [Software development
    companies like BairesDev](https://www.bairesdev.com/technologies/java-development-services/?utm_source=kdnuggets&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=content&utm_content=top)
    build and maintain business-critical applications using Java.

    provide the basic functionality to developers and help them save time and money.
    Examples of popular machine learning frameworks are:'

    with Java. Besides the fact that it has an extensive user base, Java is also one
    of the most sought-after skills in the market, as companies typically use it for
    all quickly executable projects. Java is also a legacy language - i.e. it’s used
    in many major applications and companies throughout the world.'

    Most developers use Java for creating applications that they can later scale according
    to business requirements. If your company is doing a ground-up build for an application,
    Java is an excellent choice as Java offers to scale up and to scale-out features
    along with load balancing options.'

- en: As a data scientist, you will find that building complex applications in Java
    and scaling them is easy; For example, ApacheSpark is an analytics tool you can
    use for scaling. It can also be used for building multi-threaded applications.

- en: '**4\. Java has a unique syntax.** Java’s unique syntax is accepted worldwide
    for its ease of understanding. This syntax allows developers to understand conventions,
    requirements for a variable, and coding methodology. Java is strongly typed -
    i.e., each data type is already predefined into the structure of the language,
    and all variables must be a part of some data type.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most major companies maintain a standard syntax for their code repository. Doing
    so ensures that all developer code according to conventions for production codebase.
    Java helps them by automatically maintaining its own standard conventions, which
    can be adhered to.

    You’ll be surprised to know that [Java is 25 times faster than Python](https://analyticsindiamag.com/why-do-data-scientists-prefer-python-over-java/).
    Also, if you’re looking for an application that does multiple computations at
    any point in time, Java beats Python.'

- en: Not just processing speed, Java development also takes less time to create a
    product with it when compared with many other languages. It can use business-specific
    tools for development and has lots of IDE and mature features for creating large-scale
    business applications.

- en: '**6\. Java and OLTP systems.** Online transaction processing systems (OLTP),
    along with data warehousing, typically use mainframe systems for batch processing.
    Java, more than other languages, ties more naturally into that architecture. You
    can integrate Java with COBOL and middleware software.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also combine Java with OLTP standards and architectures. For companies
    looking to invest in applications that perform data analysis on large scale systems
    with transaction processing design, Java is very suitable.

- en: For data scientists, Java provides a host of data science functionalities such
    as data analysis, data processing, statistical analysis, data visualization, and
    NLP. Java can help apply machine learning algorithms to real-world applications.
    It allows you to build adaptive and predictive models based on batch and stream
    processing techniques. And along with that REPL and lambda expression, it simplifies
    the creation of large scale applications.
