- en: If you are looking to improve your workflow, speed up development, and minimize
    bugs, the GPT-4o model is your go-to AI tool. By integrating this advanced AI
    into your Python projects, you can streamline your process, resolve issues faster,
    and focus on what truly matters. Even if you are new to coding, you can create
    Python projects using tools like ChatGPT, VSCode with GPTCode extension, and Cursor
    IDE. These tools are essential for realizing the full potential of the GPT-4o
    model in the development environment.

- en: We are all familiar with [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and its ability to
    generate Python code. In the latest update from OpenAI, the new GPT-4o model has
    been made free for everyone to use. I use ChatGPT for code generation, troubleshooting
    issues, and brainstorming. It truly understands the goals we aim to achieve with
    our applications.

    necessary code and instructions to build it, including the project structure with
    files and folders. You can ask follow-up questions to modify the project and even
    request it to run scripts to test if they work.

    But if you are a developer or software engineer, you need something that is integrated
    with your workspace. That is where CodeGPT comes in.

    you write code more efficiently. It comes with AI chat assistance, auto-completion,
    code explanation, refactoring, documentation, unit-testing, and much more.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CodeGPT extension also lets you try various AI models from different providers.
    You can even run your own AI model locally using Ollama and use it with the CodeGPT
    extension. It is an all-in-one solution for software development.

- en: In this blog, we will learn how to set it up to use GPT-4o with it. First, you
    need to generate an OpenAI API key by going to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
    After that, Install the CodeGPT extension by searching for it in the VSCode extension
    marketplace. Next, click on the CodeGPT tab and select OpenAI as the provider
    and GPT-4o as the model. It will ask you to paste the OpenAI API key to access
    the model.

- en: CodeGPT has many limitations and is slow when it comes to autocomplete. You
    can get a paid subscription to access better autocomplete models and AI agents,
    but it is still not enough when it comes to integrating AI tools into the software
    development environment. It is still an extension that is dependent on the code
    editor.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The [Cursor AI IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) is a perfect tool for hard-core
    coders, senior software engineers, and data professionals. It is a fork of VSCode
    designed for AI-assisted software development. This means it is not just an extension
    but an ecosystem with built-in functionalities to help you write better code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cursor understands your code source to provide you with better code suggestions
    and even helps you write entire Python projects from scratch.  I have completely
    switched my workflow from VSCode to Cursor because it is easy to use and has fast
    response times compared to VSCode extensions. And I am not missing out on anything
    - it is basically like using VSCode. I can still install VSCode extensions that
    I love and use the same environment. Nothing has changed.

    good job.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of the data professionals that I know use AI in their workflow to increase
    productivity and accuracy. Before AI assistant tools, it used to take them hours
    to build and test Python applications, but now they can accomplish the same tasks
    in minutes. All they have to do is review and run the code.

    Python code. We also learned about the VSCode AI assistant extension CodeGPT,
    which allows you to use various AI models to generate and improve your Python
    code. Finally, we learned about Cursor IDE, a fork of VSCode built for AI-assisted
    software development. These are the tools that I use for my day-to-day job in
    data analysis, machine learning, and even web development. I hope you can also
    benefit from them.
