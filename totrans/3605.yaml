    hold in most industries. The majority of AI projects hit a wall. Accenture estimates
    that[ 80% to 85% of companies’](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-investments) AI
    projects are in the proof-of-concept stage, and nearly [80% of enterprises fail
    to scale AI deployments across the organization](https://cnvrg.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fundamentals-of-mlops.pdf).

    It can take months, even years, to deliver value from your AI. According to Gartner's
    research, [only 53% of projects make it from artificial intelligence (AI) prototypes
    to production.](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-19-gartner-identifies-the-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021)

- en: There are still very few established standards for developing AI/machine learning
    (ML) models. Data scientists are skilled mathematicians, but in order to successfully
    bring models to production, they also need experience in software development
    methodologies and DevOps.  Models are often created from scratch without consistent
    software development processes, testing procedures or KPIs for measuring their
    performance.

- en: Skilled data scientists are a scarce resource.   Companies would prefer they
    spend their time on what they do best--delivering high-impact algorithms. But
    more often than not, due to unforeseen operational issues, they are consumed by
    other tasks, including tracking and monitoring, configurations, compute resource
    management, serving infrastructure, feature extraction, and model deployment.

    combinations of compute options that a data scientist can utilize for different
    AI workloads, including CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators, cloud, on-prem, hybrid cloud,
    co-location, and others. As a result, there is a lot of complexity and unforeseen
    challenges executing jobs to achieve high performance at a reasonable price.

- en: This is where MLOps (machine learning operations) can make a difference to help
    data scientists tackle operational issues.  MLOps is a set of practices for collaboration
    and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to automate
    the deployment of machine learning and deep learning models in large-scale production
    environments. It makes it easier to align models with business needs, implement
    standard and consistent development processes, scale-up and manage diverse data
    pipelines.

- en: Most companies are using MLOps for automating ML pipelines, monitoring, lifecycle
    management, and governance.  Using MLOps, models can be monitored to sense a degradation
    in performance or to detect a drift in results indicating that the models need
    to be retrained with more complete or fresher data. It’s also used to continuously
    experiment with new methods to take advantage of new technology, such as the latest
    language processing and text and image analysis.

    the different tools in the space, including open-source, resulted in a list of
    over 330 different MLOps tools. A report from [Cognilytica](https://www.devopsonline.co.uk/mlops-and-automl-tools-to-increase-in-the-next-few-years/)
    predicts exponential growth in MLOps tools to reach USD 125 billion by 2025\.
    That would represent a 33 percent annual growth rate.

    have a higher likelihood of success. Here are two examples.

    company and owner of The Princeton Review – the top US-based education service,
    needed to scale up deployments of its e-learning systems, including CONECTS, a
    learning platform that processes images of math problems and presents personalized
    tests to increase scores for three million students. After implementing an MLOps
    platform, ST Unitas scaled up AI activity by 10X in just a few months, without
    hiring additional engineers, improving both performance and throughput.'

    with over 10 million daily active users (DAU), uses massive amounts of data to
    reshape the gaming landscape by tailoring UX based on in-game actions. Playtika’s
    large-scale ML processes gathered millions of users and thousands of features
    every minute using batch and web services, but neither solution could process
    the data quickly enough to produce predictions in real-time. By implementing an
    MLOps platform, they increased performance by 40% and gained up to a 50% increase

    to provide its scientists the data they need to create a continuously changing
    and adaptive game environment to continue to earn top-grossing games.'

- en: With the new online economy, companies are racing to use AI insights to become
    truly data-driven. But even if machine learning models are built based on solid
    algorithms and are trained successfully based on a full set of clean data, if
    the model can’t run on the existing IT infrastructure, AI can never meet its true
    potential.  Examining and finding solutions to solve operational issues upfront
    can help AI projects reach their successful completion.
