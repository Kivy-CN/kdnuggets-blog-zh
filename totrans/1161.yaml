- en: Every year, Stack Overflow conducts a survey of its users to help inform the
    development of its community and platform. This year, more than 80,000 developers
    shared how they learn, the tools and languages they use, and provided all sorts
    of feedback valuable to Stack Overflow's direction. The results also present a
    snapshot of developers and development as of when the survey was conducted.

    were recently shared publicly, along with commentary and insight provided by Stack
    Overflow. We will take a look at some of the more interesting data points as they

- en: This year, for example, we observed a significant evolution in the way developers
    educate themselves. For the rising cohort of coders under the age of 18, online
    resources like videos and blogs are more popular than books and school combined,
    a statistic that doesn’t hold for any of our other age cohorts. Overall, the profession
    is full of new joiners, with more than 50% indicating they have been coding for
    less than a decade, and more than 35% having less than five years in the trade.

    resources. Younger respondents tend to learn from online courses, forums, and
    other online resources. Older respondents, on the other hand, learned from more

    we uncovered. There are over 10k Javascript developers that want to start or continue

    those they dread conforms quite closely with the responses to those platforms
    which developers have used. It's also not unreasonable to posit that low adoption
    of IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could be correlated with the fear that developers
    using it have of using it again.
