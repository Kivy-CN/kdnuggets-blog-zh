    of machine learning. For example, ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion. Even with 2023
    dominated by generative AI, we should be aware of many more machine learning breakthroughs.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Singing Voice Beautifying (SVB) is a novel task in generative AI that aims to
    improve the amateur singing voice into a beautiful one. It’s exactly the research
    aim of [Liu et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13277v2.pdf) when they proposed
    a new generative model called Neural Singing Voice Beautifier (NSVB).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The NSVB is a semi-supervised learning model using a latent-mapping algorithm
    that acts as a pitch corrector and improves vocal tone. The work promises to improve
    the musical industry and is worth checking out.

- en: Deep neural network models have become bigger than ever, and much research has
    been conducted to simplify the training process. Recent research by the Google
    team ([Chen et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06675v2.pdf)) has proposed
    a new optimization for the Neural Network called Lion (EvoLved Sign Momentum).
    The method shows that the algorithm is more memory-efficient and requires a smaller
    learning rate than Adam. It’s great research that shows many promises you should
    not miss.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time series analysis is a common use case in many businesses; For example, price
    forecasting, anomaly detection, etc. However, there are many challenges to analyzing
    temporal data only based on the current data (1D data). That is why [Wu et al.
    (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02186v2.pdf) propose a new method called TimesNet
    to transform the 1D data into 2D data, which achieves great performance in the
    experiment. You should read the paper to understand better this new method as
    it would help much future time series analysis.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Currently, we are in a generative AI era where many large language models were
    intensively developed by companies. Mostly this kind of research would not release
    their model or only be commercially available. However, the Meta AI research group
    ([Zhang et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01068v4.pdf)) tries to do the
    opposite by publicly releasing the Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT) model that
    could be comparable with the GPT-3\. The paper is a great start to understanding
    the OPT model and the research detail, as the group logs all the detail in the
    paper.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The generative model is not limited to only generating text or pictures but
    also tabular data. This generated data is often called synthetic data.  Many models
    were developed to generate synthetic tabular data, but almost no model to generate
    relational tabular synthetic data. This is exactly the aim of [Solatorio and Dupriez
    (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02041v1.pdf) research; creating a model called
    REaLTabFormer for synthetic relational data. The experiment has shown that the
    result is accurately close to the existing synthetic model, which could be extended
    to many applications.

    Baselines, and Building Blocks for Natural Language Policy Optimization'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reinforcement Learning conceptually is an excellent choice for the Natural Language
    Processing task, but is it true? This is a question that [Ramamurthy et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01241v2.pdf)
    try to answer. The researcher introduces various library and algorithm that shows
    where Reinforcement Learning techniques have an edge compared to the supervised
    method in the NLP tasks. It’s a recommended paper to read if you want an alternative
    for your skillset.

- en: Text-to-image generation was big in 2022, and 2023 would be projected on text-to-video
    (T2V) capability. Research by [Wu et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11565v1.pdf)
    shows how T2V can be extended on many approaches. The research proposes a new
    Tune-a-Video method that supports T2V tasks such as subject and object change,
    style transfer, attribute editing, etc. It’s a great paper to read if you are
    interested in text-to-video research.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Efficient collaboration is the key to success on any team, especially with the
    increasing complexity within machine learning fields. To nurture efficiency, [Peng
    et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01918v1.pdf) present a PyGlove library
    to share ML ideas easily. The PyGlove concept is to capture the process of ML
    research through a list of patching rules. The list can then be reused in any
    experiments scene, which improves the team's efficiency. It’s research that tries
    to solve a machine learning problem that many have not done yet, so it’s worth
    reading.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT has changed the world so much. It’s safe to say that the trend would
    go upward from here as the public is already in favor of using ChatGPT. However,
    how is the ChatGPT current result compared to the Human Experts? It’s exactly
    a question that [Guo et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07597v1.pdf) try
    to answer. The team tried to collect data from experts and ChatGPT prompt results,
    which they compared. The result shows that implicit differences between ChatGPT
    and experts were there. The research is something that I feel would be kept asked
    in the future as the generative AI model would keep growing over time, so it’s
    worth reading.
