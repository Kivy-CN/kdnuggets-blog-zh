- en: It is becoming more important to master MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)
    for those who want to effectively deploy, monitor, and maintain their ML models
    in production. MLOps is a set of practices that aims to merge ML system development
    (Dev) and ML system operation (Ops). Luckily, the open-source community has created
    numerous resources to assist beginners in mastering these concepts and tools.
