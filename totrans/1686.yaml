- en: How many stores that you grew up visiting aren’t around anymore? Remember Sears,
    Zellers, American Apparel, Wet Seal, The Limited, etc. Many other prominent retailers
    like Aeropostale, Bebe, A&F, Guess, J.C Penney, Payless, Rue2, etc. are closing
    hundreds of stores nationwide to deal with dwindling sales. Forbes estimates that
    in last sector of 2017, 21 retailers are closing 3,591 stores. They can’t compete
    with the e-commerce sector as more and more customers resort to shopping online
    as reduced prices from the comfort of their homes in lieu of physically going
    to retail stores. Retailers are forced to leverage data in order to upgrade their
    infrastructure and services to give their customers a better experience. Many
    job postings at Macy’s, Coach, Kate Spade, Nordstrom, etc. show how serious and
    desperate the retail and fashion giants are in face of competition.

- en: Fashion industry is an extremely competitive and dynamic market. Trends and
    styles change with the blink of an eye. A collection or trend takes thousands
    of man-hours from the most creative minds and the lucrative outcome depends on
    the simple Hot or Not judgements from fashion pundits, bloggers and celebrities.
    Data Science can be used here on historical data to predict the trends which will
    be “Hot” hence potentially saving a lot of time and money. For example, training
    good models on previous sales data can help us predict whether Kanye West’s new
    Yeezy Season 6 collection will be a success or not. Data Scientists can use concepts
    from predictive algorithms, visual search, capturing structured data from photographs,
    natural language processing and many more.

    the fashion and retail industry. The vast historical data from retailers and department
    stores about the spending habits of customers is a traditional source. With the
    advent of social media, engagement on posts, Instagram trends, Twitter hashtags,
    clothing style of the most popular fashion bloggers, celebrity fashion styles,
    the “likes/reactions” on popular celebrities, etc. provide us a rich collection
    of insight-ridden data. A new technique to test the reaction before the deployment
    of the collection is to release photos on Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
    Pinterest) and study the comments to make changes to the collection before launching.
    Sentiment analysis is used here to get insights from the public opinion. The public
    API of these sites are open and easy to use. Data can be scrapped in real-time
    through these API’s and converted to usable form. Online data sources are raw
    and uncensored and voice the public opinion. This data has a lot of potential
    if harnessed properly. Most data you find online is unstructured : texts, images,
    audio and YouTube videos. Unstructured data can be a challenge to use in its native
    form and needs to be cleaned and transformed.'

    The pattern of the customers is tracked to see how long they stay, which sections
    they visit sequentially, how often they come back and how long they stay in each
    section. This kind of data can be useful to arrange the collection in stores and
    to place closely the items frequently purchased together.

    They adopt the concept of “fast fashion”, where the whole process of designing
    a collection to shipping it to stores takes a maximum of three weeks. The success
    of this brand is attributed to this dynamic concept where the retailer studies
    the choices and preference of the customer to create a collection catering their
    tastes. They create what the customer craves instead of selling what they design.
    The customer themselves may not know what they are particularly looking for, but
    the smart business analysts and data scientists at Zara make use of the data to
    create a collection which the customers will automatically want because it’s their
    “taste”. Moreover Zara has stores all over the world and their customers have
    different demographics which means something as simple as size, body shape, colour
    preferences and quantity will vary greatly. Producing the right quantity of right
    products helps minimize wastage.

    a best-selling collection. The range of colors for a particular style, the combination
    of colors purchased together, etc. can be mined from sales data and online retail
    data. Many times customers purchase a piece of clothing in one color and then
    exchange it for another. The data from the returns/exchange can be used to create
    more items of the preferred color.

- en: Each designer targets a different demographic or gender to increase their popularity
    or sales. Designers need to decide how much items in each collection and the kind
    of variety they need to create. They have a fixed set of resources like budget
    and display space and they need data-backed guidelines to decide how much to allot
    to each category. It is common in many stores like Forever21, H&M, etc. to see
    two/three floors of space given for women’s merchandise and only one for men’s.
    These retailers know to provide more options for a particular category of customers
    to increase their sales. These insights are derived from historic sales data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many styles featured on the runway are not “wearable” in real-life. Trends on
    the runway are exaggerated and too over-the-top for retail. The outfits need to
    be altered before they can be curated for sale in stores. Training algorithms
    to suggest which features to change like color, fabric, cut, length, combination,
    etc. can ensure that the product sells well when they hit the racks. Moreover
    each country/region has a different taste. Hence each product must be tweaked
    to suit the local preferences.

    be willing to pay given the quality, style, popularity and the brand value. Big
    Data should be used to average previous sales data to generate suggested pricing.
    Data from competing brands can also be used to set prices which aren’t too high
    but still contribute to good revenues.

- en: A brand needs to find new products that will be successful in the market and
    which product aren’t very lucratively promising. Designers need to think whether
    making a unique new product will be accepted or rejects by customers. For example
    a creative bright print may work for yoga pants but may be deemed too gaudy for
    sneakers. Big Data can be used to decide which category to venture into and whether
    to continue selling a particular previous product.

- en: Customers exhibit a particular behavior while shopping which can be studied
    to arrange merchandise in a manner which increase the chances of sales of majority
    of the pieces. Associative data mining can help us decide where to group products
    together so customer is likely to pick up most of them. You may have noticed that
    in many clothing stores, the accessories are placed when we stand near the billing
    area which causes the customers to pick them up. Wifi data can be used to track
    the customer movement in the stores to arrange the stock in an optimal manner.

- en: Without a doubt we can say that data powered decisions will give you an edge
    in the competitive world of fashion. Before creating any product, data needs to
    be consulted to see it is economically feasible and promising. Selectively using
    your data to create and convert product lines your customers are sure to buy in
    the future would help the retails houses survive in the wake of e-commerce. Some
    may say that AI can dull the creativity of the collections by just creating what
    the customer want. But that is why the outcomes should be used only to supplement
    the human creative insight instead of entirely replacing it. But it doesn’t hurt
    to create the right product at the right price at the right time.
