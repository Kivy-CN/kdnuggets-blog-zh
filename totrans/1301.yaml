    hypothesis sets the direction and plan for a Data Science project. Accordingly,
    a hypothesis is the most important item for evaluating whether a Data Science
    project will be successful.

    in favor of hands-on testing for feature significance and applying models on data
    in order to see if they are able to predict anything. While there is certainly
    always a need for feature engineering and model selection, doing so without true
    understanding of a problem can be dangerous and inefficient.

    problems which guarantees both a relevant hypothesis and a strong signal as to
    whether a Data Science approach will be successful. In this article, I outline
    the steps used to do this: defining a data context, examining available data,
    and forming the hypothesis. I also take a look at a few completed competitions
    from Kaggle and run them through the process in order to provide real examples
    of this method in action.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much like forming a Free Body Diagram in a physics problem or utilizing Object-Oriented
    Design in Computer Science, describing all valid entities in a given data context
    helps to map out the expected interplay between them. The goal of this step is
    to completely designate all the data that could possibly be collected about anything
    in the context i.e. a description of the perfect dataset. If all of this data
    were available, then the interactions between the components would be completely
    defined and heuristic formulas could be used to define every type of cause and
    effect.

- en: '*2. Examining Overlap of Available Data to Data Context*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, an observation is conducted to determine how much of the available data
    fits into the perfect dataset defined in the previous step. The more overlap found,
    the better a solution space for defining interactions between entities. While
    not a numeric metric, this observation gives a strong signal for intuition of
    whether the available data is appropriate and relevant enough. If there is a complete
    overlap, then a heuristic is probably a better solution than fitting a data model.
    If there is very little overlap, then even the best modeling techniques will be
    unable to consistently provide accurate predictions. Note that the strongest predictive
    signals will always be those that are directly related, thus indirect feature
    relation is given less emphasis in favor of the real thing. The intuition behind
    focusing mainly on strong signals is that collecting better data with strong signals
    will guarantee better performance and reliability. Conversely, predictions using
    weak signals are prime candidates to become obsolete once better data is available.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having completed the previous two steps, forming a hypothesis itself becomes
    trivial. Hypotheses are generally formed by combining a set of available features
    to predict the outcome of another feature that may be hard to collect in the future
    or whose value may be needed ahead of its outcome.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Now that the overlap between the data context and available data has been clearly
    defined, and assuming a reasonable amount of the available data is relevant/class-balanced/etc,
    a hypothesis can simply be stated as: “The available data can produce significant
    results predicting *____ *in the given data context”. Note that the prediction
    label is left open-ended since it can potentially be filled in with many different
    things! This is because a hypothesis can be formed around almost any of the given
    features as long as it fits within the data context and there is enough overlap
    with the available data. Picking the specific feature to predict will depend upon
    what use cases are most beneficial.'

    nature that predictions are performed for a virtual world. Predictions of simulations
    are expected to behave much more consistently and operate along very clearly defined
    paths, as opposed to real-life systems which may have factors not easily observable.
    In other words, the data context can very confidently be exhaustively defined.

    this technique for generating hypotheses ignores feature correlation or indirect
    relation in favor of focusing on the absolute strongest signals i.e. directly
    related features. In this competition, predictions involving the Player-Controlled
    Character and the Match are captured with a good amount of detail.Contrary to
    this, although we might be able to infer things about a Player based on their
    Player-Controlled Character this is avoided since it makes for a weaker hypothesis.
