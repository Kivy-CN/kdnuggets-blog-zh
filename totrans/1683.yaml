    adding solar cells to a particular house. This is what Google’s [Project Sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof#p=0) does
    with Deep Learning. Enter an address and Google uses a Deep Learning framework
    to estimate how much money you could save in energy costs with solar cells over
    20 years (see Figure 1).

    be an even better way to estimate solar energy savings. For example, you want
    to use Deep Learning to estimate how much solar energy we could generate with
    solar panels on the Golden Gate Bridge (that probably wouldn’t be a very popular
    decision in San Francisco). The obvious application would be to analyze several
    photos of the Golden Gate Bridge and estimate clear skies based upon cloud coverage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However instead of estimating the potential solar energy generation based upon
    “cloud coverage,” what if we wanted to use “sunlight reflection” to generate the
    solar energy estimate (see Figure 2)?

    sunglasses or anything else – is the better predictor of solar energy generation?

    scientists; the best data scientists have strong imaginative skills for not just
    “thinking outside the box” – but actually redefining the box – in trying to find
    variables and metrics that ***might*** be better predictors of performance.

    something is possible. It’s a data scientist’s most important concept, because
    “might” gives the data scientist the license to explore, be wrong, learn and try
    again.

    are leveraging Big Data and existing Machine Learning and Deep Learning technologies
    is staggering. Let me give you one example of how data scientists from one of
    our Services teams at Dell EMC are thinking outside the box, to uncover new ways
    to help our customers avoid issues in their IT environment and create a more effortless
    support experience.

    several times a minute for the life of a device. Most of these 260+ variables
    have incomplete or sparse data, the collection timing doesn’t always line up nice
    and neat, and getting time continuity across the devices is a major challenge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you were using a traditional Machine Learning algorithm, the data science
    team would have to spend an overwhelming amount of time 1) feature engineering
    new variables based on domain knowledge, and 2) using trial-and-error to determine
    which combinations of variables should even be included in the Machine Learning
    model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, our Dell EMC Services data scientists used a Patent Pending approach
    to Deep Learning to “pixelate” the data. They turned the over 260+ variables into
    device performance “images.” Then once they created these “images,” the team leveraged
    a recurrent neural network to find “shapes” and repeatable patterns out of random
    pixels (see Figure 3).

- en: A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where
    connections between units form a directed cycle. RNNs can use their internal memory
    to process arbitrary sequences of inputs, which typically makes RNNs ideal for
    handwriting or speech recognition. Except in this case, instead of trying to decipher
    handwriting into words, the data science team used the RNN to ***decipher*** the
    seemingly random pixels into a prediction on the state of the device (see Figure
    4).

    square peg into the round “Machine Learning” hole. Instead, they used Deep Learning
    in a different context to decipher seemingly random pixels into a prediction of
    the health of a device. The data scientists didn’t wait until someone developed
    a better Machine Learning algorithm. Instead, they looked at the wide variety
    of Machine Learning and Deep Learning tools and algorithms available to them,
    and applied them to a different, but related use case. If we can predict the health
    of a device and the potential problems that could occur with that device, then
    we can also help customers prevent those problems, significantly enhancing their
    support experience and positively impacting their environment.

    most important characteristics is that they refuse to take “it can’t be done”
    as an answer. They are willing to try different variables and metrics, and different
    type of advanced analytic algorithms, to see if there is another way to predict
