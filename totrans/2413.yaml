    a model that returns an optimum solution using a sequence of solutions that have
    been created for a specific problem.'

    a reward signal is generated. If the model performs closer to the goal, a positive
    reward is generated; however, if the model performs further away from the goal,
    a negative reward is generated.

    find the next best action that can maximize the reward, randomly. The algorithm
    updates the value function based on an equation, making it a **value-based** learning
    algorithm.'

- en: It’s like when you’re trying to find a solution to your current situation, to
    ensure you reap maximum benefits. The model can generate its own rules and even
    operate outside of the policy provided. Implying that there is no need for a policy,
    making it an off-policy learner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An **off-policy learner** is when the model learns the value of the optimal
    policy regardless of the agent’s actions. An **on-policy learner** is when the
    model learns the value of the policy carried out by the agent, finding an optimal
    policy.

    if the user purchases or clicks on the suggested product.
