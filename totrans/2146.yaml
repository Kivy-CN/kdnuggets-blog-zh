    week, OpenAI has now rolled out its ambitious new ChatGPT add-on: the aptly named
    GPTs.'

- en: Anyone can easily build their own GPT—no coding is required. You can make them
    for yourself, just for your company’s internal use, or for everyone. Creating
    one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge,
    and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing
    data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since launching ChatGPT people have been asking for ways to customize ChatGPT
    to fit specific ways that they use it. We launched Custom Instructions in July
    that let you set some preferences, but requests for more control kept coming.
    Many power users maintain a list of carefully crafted prompts and instruction
    sets, manually copying them into ChatGPT. GPTs now do all of that for you.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is this a replacement for fine-tuned language models, such as GPT-3.5 Turbo
    or open source alternatives? Well, no. It's more a combination of Custom Instructions
    (as mentioned above), custom prompts, and retrieval augmented generation on your
    own uploaded documents. GPTs would be akin to using a plain vanilla LLM with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/),
    a series of prompt templates, a UI such as [Text Generation Web UI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui),
    and a [RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) implementation for knowledge retrieval.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GPTs aim to make the combination and configuration of these quick and simple,
    however, so let's give it a try.

    Open AI Dev Days demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk), so I went
    through the process. Note that this was off the cuff once I noticed that I had
    access to GPT Builder, and so it was not meticulously planned. Let's see just
    how quickly and trouble-free we can put something together.

    create a real estate advice chatbot. And it was to have the voice and personality
    of George Costanza.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do this, I started the GPT Builder process. First I had to let it know what
    the high level description of the GPT was to be.

- en: Next I was asked about how it should frame responses, and anything else of importance
    to the GPT personality. I first stated that responses should be factual and that
    the GPT should ask clarifying questions if and when necessary. To give it a personality,
    I downloaded a [Seinfeld script dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles/),
    unpacked it, and uploaded the raw content as knowledge for retrieval, directing
    the GPT to learn and mimic George Costanza's "voice" and interactions. Here is
    what GPT Builder learned from these instructions.
  prefs: []

- en: Agent George will incorporate George Costanza's distinctive speech patterns
    and reactions into his interactions. He'll express his points with a mix of neurotic
    humor and a tendency to overthink, often veering into personal anecdotes or hyperbolic
    scenarios. Agent George will use rhetorical questions, self-deprecation, and a
    hint of paranoia in his advice, true to George Costanza's style. His advice will
    be wrapped in the form of short, punchy remarks, infused with a sense of urgency
    and an occasionally agitated tone. He'll be personable, engaging, and will bring
    a unique comedic perspective to real estate inquiries, while avoiding detailed
    financial or legal advice.

    created a profile picture, but I didn't like it and uploaded my own) and I added
    the instruction to end each user interaction with a situation-relevant Seinfeld
    quote. And that was it. [Agent George](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-d4hBUujBP-agent-george)
    was ready for action, all in approximately 5 minutes.

- en: OpenAI's GPTs are as easy to create, configure, and share as promised. I believe
    it's a clever move to increase ecosystem buy-in in the face of the unknown, namely
    Google's mythical Gemini, which may or may not be on the way soon, and which may
    or may not live up to its hype. The question in my mind, however, remains whether
    or not OpenAI's GPTs will prove to be as useful as OpenAI seems to be counting
    on. I guess time will tell.
