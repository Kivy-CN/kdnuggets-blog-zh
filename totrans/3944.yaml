- en: Open-ended survey questions often provide the most useful insights, but if you
    are dealing with hundreds or thousands of people’s answers, summarising them will
    give you the biggest headache. If you are a data scientist, you may try using
    an NLP library or an API, but tuning them is hard and the results are often difficult
    to interpret. If you don’t have a **qualitative research** background, this article
    will help you learn the best practices from people who have been working with
    text, also referred to as **qualitative data**, for decades.

    data**: data that can be easily expressed as numbers or categories. Statistical
    and machine learning techniques “love” numbers. Text on the other hand is hard,
    but it is important! Qualitative researchers believe that numbers won’t get you
    far. They believe that by interviewing people and asking them to answer open-ended
    questions you can learn more than by simply looking at hard data.'

    to ‘How likely on a scale from 0 to 9 are you to recommend us to friend or family?’
    will give you a single measure of company’s performance. But it’s the open-ended
    answers to the question ‘Why did you give us that score?’ that will teach you
    how to improve that measure in the future.

- en: A lot of text is produced during qualitative research, and in order to draw
    conclusions, a technique called ***coding*** is used. Survey questions where respondents
    can write whatever they like are also called open-ended questions. Each of the
    responses is known as a verbatim.‘Coding’ or ‘tagging’ each response with one
    or more codes helps capture what the response is about, and in turn summarise
    the results of the entire survey effectively.

- en: If we compare coding to NLP methods for analysing text, in some cases coding
    can be similar to text categorisation and in others to keyword extraction. Next,
    we explore what is involved in coding and the different methodologies that can
    be used. We often refer to how to perform the task manually, but if you are looking
    at using an automatic solution, this knowledge will help you understand what matters
    and how to choose an approach that’s effective.

- en: 'When creating codes they are put into a coding frame. This frame is important
    because it represents the organizational structure and influences how the coded
    results can be used. There are two types of frame: ‘flat’ and ‘hierarchical’:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **Flat** frame means that all codes are treated as being of the same level
    of specificity and importance. While this frame is easy to understand, organizing
    and navigating it is difficult if it gets large.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hierarchical** frames capture a taxonomy of how the codes relate to one another.
    They allow you to apply a different level of granularity during coding and analysis
    of the results.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One interesting application of a hierarchical frame is to support sentiment
    differences. If the top level code describes what the response is about, a mid
    level code can describe if it is positive or negative and a third level the attribute
    or specific theme. An example of this type of coding frame is shown below.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One very important thing to consider is the size and the coverage of the coding
    frame. When coding it is important that responses containing the same themes,
    even if they are expressed differently, are grouped under the same code. For example,
    a code ‘cleanliness’ could cover responses mentioning words like ‘clean’, ‘tidy’,
    ‘dirty’, ‘dusty’ and phrases like ‘looked like a dump’, ‘could eat of the floor’.
    This requires the coder to have a good understanding of each code and its ***coverage***.
    Having few codes and a fixed frame makes the decision easier. Having many codes,
    particularly in a flat frame, makes it harder as there can be ambiguity and sometimes
    it isn’t clear what exactly a response mean. Manual coding also requires the coder
    to remember or be able to find all the relevant codes which is harder with a large
    coding frame.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, coding frames should be ***flexible***. Coding a survey is a costly
    task, especially if done manually, and so the results should be useable in different
    contexts. Imagine this: You are trying to answer the question ‘what do people
    think about customer service’ and create codes capturing key answers. Then you
    find that the same survey responses also have many comments about your company’s
    products.   In order to answer ‘what do people say about our products’, you may
    find yourself having to code from scratch! Creating a coding frame that is flexible
    and has good coverage (see the Inductive Style below) is a good way to get value
    in the future.'

- en: Deductive Coding Using pre-existing frame
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With deductive coding you start with a predefined set of codes. These might
    come from an existing taxonomy, codes that cover departments in a business or
    industry specific terms. This often means that the codes are driven by a project
    objective and are intended to report back on specific questions. For example,
    if the survey is about customer experience and you already know that you are interested
    in problems that arise from call wait times then this would be one of the codes.
    This has the benefit that you can guarantee the items you are interested in will
    be covered but you need to be careful of bias.When you use a pre-existing coding
    frame, you are starting with a bias as to what the answers could be and might
    miss themes that would emerge naturally from people’s responses.

- en: When deciding what codes to create several things should be considered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Ensure Coverage**. Codes should cover as many survey responses as relevant.
    This means the code should be more generic than the comment itself to allow it
    to cover other responses. Of course this needs to be balanced with the usefulness
    for analysis. For example ‘Product’ is a very broad code that will have high coverage
    but limited usefulness. On the other hand ‘Product stops working after using it
    for 3 hours’ is very specific and is unlikely to cover many responses.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Avoid Commonality**. While it is ok to have codes that are similar there
    should be an obvious difference between them. In maths this is referred to as
    orthogonality and captures how independent two things are. ‘Customer Service’
    and ‘Product’ would be orthogonal while ‘Customer service’ and ‘Customer support’
    may have subtle differences but are not orthogonal and may work better as the
    same code.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Create contrast**. Try to create codes that contrast with each other. This
    allows for both the positive and negative elements of the same thing to be extracted
    separately. For example ‘Useful product features’ and ‘Unnecessary product features’
    would have contrast.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Reduce data**. Let’s look at the two extremes: There are as many codes as
    comments, or each code applies to all responses. In both cases, the coding exercise
    is pointless. So, try to think about how to reduce the number of data points so
    that analysis can be done effectively. The example above of ‘Product stops working
    after using it for 3 hours’ is an example that fails this test. More effective
    would be a code like ‘Product stops after use’.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very difficult to ensure consistency regardless of whether a deductive
    or inductive process is used. This is because a coder’s mental frame and past
    experiences color how they interpret things. This means that different people
    given the same task are very likely to disagree on what the proper codes should
    be. In fact, one study has shown that the same person coding the same survey on
    a different day will produce different results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mitigate this by logging all decisions and thoughts that went into coding. Review
    them when applying existing codes or deciding if a new one is necessary. This
    process will also mean that the choice of codes can be backed up with evidence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A different, more expensive, approach to ensure accuracy is through deliberate
    testing of the coding reliability. The ‘test-retest’ method involves the same
    person coding the data twice without looking at the results. The ‘independent-coder’
    method uses a second coder on the same survey. In both cases the results are then
    compared for consistency and amended as needed.
