    world many prospective Data Scientists wants to start sooner and are interested
    in Data Science/ML certificates which can be obtained in a few weeks. Others have
    been working for a while but want a credential - a certification - to validate
    their knowledge of Analytics / Data Science.

    to an assessment provided by a professional society, such as INFORMS, or a company,
    such as Microsoft. This generally certifies that a person has achieved a high
    level of professional knowledge. Some companies call their certificates "certifications"
    but we included them with other certificates in Tables 2a and 2b below.
