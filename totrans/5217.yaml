    Query Language (or see-quel as we call it) will remain an important part of it.
    In this blog, let us explore data science and its relationship with SQL, including
    answers to the 5 Ws and 1 H – how, why, where, when, who and what. We will also
    learn the basics of Database Management Systems (DBMS) and understand how being
    a data scientist could be the best choice for your career.

- en: The digital world is at its peak, and with growing demands and extensive marketing
    strategies data has become the key to all marketing purposes. For example, if
    I want to buy a new phone, I go to online shops like Amazon or Flipkart, browse
    through different brands, put a few in my cart, but decide to buy it later after
    some more research. Internally, the online shop would save my shopping cart and
    browsing history and show me suggestions for more phones when I come back later.
    Even if I don’t buy, the company would send me emails to remind me that my shopping
    cart is "still waiting for me." Data, thus plays the most important role in creating
    a relationship between buyer and seller. The more data customer shells out, the
    more customized a stream is presented to the buyer. This is not just true for
    e-commerce, but data science is proving extremely useful in many other domains
    like healthcare, manufacturing, banking, finance and transport.

    handling humongous amounts of data that need to be processed on a regular basis.
    It also acts as an important tool for the right marketing and feedback that data
    science intends to do. For example, if you don’t like a video that Facebook is
    suggesting you – you would say ‘hide this’ and Facebook will immediately ask you
    for a reason. These user preferences also need to be stored somewhere.

    offer high performance and speed, SQL databases are still most widely used for
    all practical purposes. There are more developers who understand SQL technology
    and hence the support and documentation are more plentiful. Further, data integrity
    is one key factor that makes SQL stand apart from any NoSQL database, by way of
    the assurance that no duplicates or unauthorized data can enter the system. Also,
    for complex queries and joins, a well-structured relational database works better.

- en: In a relational database model, all the data points are related or connected
    to each other. While creating this kind of database, the relationships between
    various tables and columns has to be defined in the design stage itself. In our
    above example, the three tables are related. The customer table’s [primary key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key)
    ("a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes (columns) that uniquely specify
    a tuple (row) in a relation (table)") will be `customer_id`, whereas `order_id`
    will be a [foreign key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key) ("set of attributes
    subject to a certain kind of inclusion dependency constraint, specifically a constraint
    that the tuples consisting of the foreign key attributes in one relation, R, must
    also exist in some other (not necessarily distinct) relation, S"). In the same
    way, the `book_id` and `order_id` combined can be the composite key for book table.
    These relations have to be defined during the creation stage itself.
