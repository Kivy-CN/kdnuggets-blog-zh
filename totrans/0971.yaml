    professional, you must have used this software for school projects, analysis surveys,
    research papers, databases, or for invoicing. The Microsoft ecosystem has made
    it quite easy for us to integrate Excel sheets into our day-to-day tasks.

    simple, there are so many Excel features that we can learn to improve our day-to-day
    tasks. Instead of using third-party tools to create data visualization, we can
    use Excel built-in features to create interactive charts and graphs.
