    put together by instructor [Kylie Ying](https://www.youtube.com/c/YCubed). The
    course aims to bring machine learning fundamentals to complete beginners.

    will learn the basics of Machine Learning and how to use TensorFlow to implement
    many different concepts.

- en: Not only does the course introduce concepts to newcomers, but it gets you up
    implementing these concepts with code straight away. Thus, while this is a course
    for beginners to machine learning, it's not for beginners to coding.

- en: First off, the course starts by covering the absolute basics, such as introductory
    Google Colab, the basics of what machine learning is, what features are, what
    classification and regression are, and what it means to prepare data and to train
    a model. You then wade into the machine learning waters and cover the theory and
    implementation of algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, logistic
    regression, and support vector machines.

- en: Attention then turns to neural networks and TensorFlow for the remainder of
    the course. You will learn to implement classifiers in TensorFlow, learn about
    linear regression with neurons, implement regression neural networks using TensorFlow,
    and k-means clustering. The course finishes off with principal component analysis
    and an implementation of k-means and PCA.
