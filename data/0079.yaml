    yes. This year alone there were a lot of advancements, one after another and it
    was hard for us to keep up. It seemed like every day we were learning something
    new and were on our toes.

    a human being can. This means that machines will have to possess human-level intelligence,
    without any help. The groundwork for AI began in the early 1900s, with many stating
    that achieving AGI would complete the ultimate goal of the AI legacy.

  zh: 所以我们知道，AGI 是一种能够执行任何人类能完成的智力任务的 AI 系统。这意味着机器必须具备人类水平的智能，而无需任何帮助。人工智能的基础工作始于
    20 世纪初，许多人表示，实现 AGI 将完成 AI 遗产的**终极目标**。
- en: It’s not to say that AI systems currently don’t possess the ability to perform
    tasks at a highly accurate level, better than humans. However, there is something
    that is missing with AI systems, and that is their general-purpose ability. This
    means that they lack the ability to adapt to new situations in a quick manner,
    without the need for instructions.

    world, one in particular is Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT. I’d like to
    state that Generative AI and Artificial General intelligence have their similarities,
    but they are different. Generative AI is a deep learning model that has the ability
    to generate content such as text and images, based on the data it was trained
    on.

- en: To give you an example, an AI chess program will most likely finish you at a
    chess game, but the same AI system will not be able to tell you about what’s currently
    happening in world politics. This is because it is limited to a specific domain,
    and that’s all.

- en: As we mentioned, AGI lacks general-purpose ability, which is also what Generative
    AI lacks - as that is not its purpose. Generative AI will aid AGI in its journey,
    but it is important to note that they are not the same.

  zh: 强化学习
- en: Alongside this approach, there has also been an increase in reinforcement learning.
    The aim of reinforcement learning is to train a model to return an optimum solution
    by using a sequence of solutions and/or decisions that have been created for a
    specific problem. In order for the model to choose the right solution/decision,
    a reward signal is put in place.
  id: totrans-30

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 与这种方法并行的是，强化学习的应用也在增加。强化学习的目的是通过使用为特定问题创建的解决方案和/或决策序列来训练模型，以返回最佳解决方案。为了使模型能够选择正确的解决方案/决策，设置了奖励信号。
- en: If the model performs closer to the goal, a positive reward is given; however,
    if the model performs further away from the goal, a negative reward is given.
    Machine learning models learn by understanding their environment and receiving
    feedback based on their actions.

  zh: 如果模型的表现接近目标，就会给予正向奖励；然而，如果模型的表现远离目标，则给予负向奖励。机器学习模型通过理解其环境并根据其行动接收反馈来学习。

    that you need to overcome. In the matter of research and development, the major
    challenge that AGI is facing is the ability to build a system that can understand
    the input context and adapt to it the same way humans do. Researchers are looking
    into new ways that an algorithm can think more in a creative manner to overcome
    this. For example, some researchers are looking at the possibility of intelligent
