    you would most likely need to take is the tokenization of the text you are using.
    This is very important and the performance of downstream tasks greatly depends
    on it. We can easily find tokenizers online that can tokenize English language
    datasets. But what if you want to tokenize a non-English language data. What if
    you do not find any tokenizer for the specific type of data you are using? How
    would you tokenize it? Well, this article explains exactly that.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tokenization process takes a body of text and breaks it into pieces, or
    tokens, which can then be transformed into a format the model can work with. In
    this case, the model can only process numbers, so the tokens are converted into
    numbers. This process is critical because it changes raw content into a structured
    format that models can understand and analyze. Without tokenization, we would
    have no way to pass text to machine learning models as these models can only understand
    numbers and not strings of texts directly.

- en: Training tokenizers from scratch is particularly important when you are working
    with non-English languages or specific domains. Standard pretrained tokenizers
    may not effectively handle the unique characteristics, vocabulary, and syntax
    of different languages or specialized characters. A new tokenizer can be trained
    to manage specific language features and terminologies. This leads to better tokenization
    accuracy and improved model performance. Not only that, custom tokenizers allows
    us to include domain-specific tokens and the handling of rare or out-of-vocabulary
    words. This improves the effectiveness of NLP models in applications involving
    many languages.

    may need to train your own tokenizer. But how would you do that? Now that you
    know the need and importance of training your own tokenizer, we will explain step
    by step how to do this.
