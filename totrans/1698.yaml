    DS, ML or DL — acronyms for Data Science, Machine Learning or Deep Learning. Beware
    of the cliche though: “80% of all the statistics are made on the spot”. If you
    blinked on these acronyms perhaps you need to google a bit and then continue reading
    the rest of this post. This post has 2 goals. First, it attempts to put all the
    fellow Data Science learners at ease. Second, if you have just begun on the Data
    Science, this may serve you as a guide to the next step.'

- en: I started the journey of Data Science in the beginning of October, 2017\. First
    15 days spent in just trying to answer a single question, “What is Data Science”
    in a manner that is convincing to me. After browsing a variety of resources on
    the internet, Quora, Medium, Springboard blogs and e-books, Udacity blogs, Forbes,
    datascience.com, KDnuggets, datasciencecentral.com, analyticsvidhya and random
    web-crawling, absorbing all the information with spoonfuls of salt (pinches of
    salt not enough, don’t blame me for not warning you), I concluded that Data Science
    (in layman terms) is making a computer draw nice graphs using data and translating
    it into a story that makes sense to address business problems. Yes, it is that
    simple. No it is not? yes it is. Well, there are two broad types of Data Science
    jobs, here I am talking about Data science for business. The other one’s end product
    is not a story, but a data driven product. Let us not get into that because then
    we digress into Machine Learning Engineering. Typically Google, Facebook etc have
    data driven roles, which fall into second category. Much of the academic research
    is also of second type too.

    Science is the process of coming up with answers to business questions with the
    help of historical data, by cleaning and analysing it first, then fitting it into
    one (or combination) of the machine learning model(s) and often forecasting and
    suggesting measures to prevent possible future issues. Ah. that is quite cool,
    isn’t it? Once I got convinced about first question, I thought about what is the
    best way to learn it.

    This time there was no other option but to try a few of them. I have Bachelors
    and Masters degrees in Electronics and Communications Engineering and a decade
    of experience of programming in languages like C/C++, Octave/Matlab, Verilog/SystemVerilog,
    Perl. Mathematics was my favorite subject since my childhood, Probability was
    the favorite in Masters. Experience with programming and Probability is a definite
    plus in my case.

    to face the fear head on, so ended up enrolling in Prof Andrew’s Coursera course.
    That is the first one I took and I am glad it worked well for me. I was literally
    scared of both Python the snake and the language, but fortunately Andrew’s course
    exercises are in Octave. I tried learning Python fundamentals from Coursera, Udacity,
    Edx and Datacamp and chose Coursera and Datacamp. I knew that as a beginner in
    data science, R would perhaps be the better start. However, at that point of time,
    I was not too confident of taking only the data science path. Python is more general.
    Took several courses across several platform at the same time. Tried Intro to
    Machine Learning, Statistics, CS Fundamentals, Intro to Data Science etc on Udacity.
    Could not continue with them for a long time, as I do not like interrupts when
    a concept is being absorbed by my neurons.

    a nice Coursera one on “Learning how to learn” by UC, San Diego. It helped me
    to reassure that the learning techniques I apply are good enough. In addition,
    it removed my doubts on whether I am not young enough to take up something new,
    as the recent research has proven that certain activities like exercise, meditation
    or just walking in nature (which anyway I do) give birth to new neurons in the
    brain and form new connections. The [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
    technique presented is helpful. I also found it the right time to take up a course
    titled “A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment” by Indian School of Business. The
    content of this course has made me dispassionately pursue my passion of Data Science.
    It reminds me to learn it for the pure joy of learning and focus on the process,
    rather than the end product. Although these are non-technical, I find them super-helpful
    in fast and effective learning.

    DS Consulting company that also conducts training. I was not too impressed by
    their model. They train you with your own money and if you do well, recruit you
    as employee. The takeaway from the meetup was: “MOOCs will not get you a job,
    real projects, Kaggle competitions, having your own blogs will. Masters from reputed
    institutes will matter, but MOOC certificates from same institutes carry no value”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here’s my take on that: “It doesn’t matter which path you take to learn. All
    that matters is, you can do a real world DS project”. If you have a way to prove
    that in an interview, why can’t you get a job? You don’t need to shell out thousands
    of dollars on bootcamps or get MOOC certificates either. You need to have a set
    of qualities/talents/skills to be a Data Scientist: good understanding of fundamentals
    in high-school math-probability-statistics, a lot of curiosity, inquisitiveness,
    inclination to learn new things, familiarity with programming, ability to document
    and present, and above all, you must know that you possess these. [If you have
    self-doubts, you need to get them out of the way first.] Learning the rest (like
    ML) follows. Companies, especially in smaller towns like mine are in so much need
    for a Data Scientist that they are looking for means to hire a good one. Keep
    in mind though, it is essential that you do a few real DS projects and showcase
    them to prospective employers through reports/presentations or github repo. If
    you are unsure how to do a real project, one way is to seek help from a mentor-an
    industry expert for technical stuff. Then the job search process calls for another
    post, out of scope of this one.'

    are no shortcuts. Try out a few platforms and see what suits best for you. Start
    with MOOCs followed by going hands on. Be sure to be organized and document your
    journey. First learn a topic which is not in your comfort zone. For example, if
    you already know C++, don’t jump into learning Python, instead know that you can
    do it eventually. It makes sense to try ML to see if you like it, because that
    is what separates a data scientist from a data analyst or data engineer. If you
    do not enjoy learning in any of them on your own, chances are that you won’t be
    able to learn even with a bootcamp. Data Science is a field which requires learning
    everyday: new tools, new concepts/algorithms, new business/domains, could be anything
    on earth, there are only steps, and no end.'
