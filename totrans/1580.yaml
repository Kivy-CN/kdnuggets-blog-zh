    whether the dataset you are dealing with is a population or a sample. As you might
    recall, a population is a collection of all items of interest in your study whereas
    a sample is a subset of data points from that population. Let’s take a short refresher!

    our population? For each sample, we’ll calculate the mean. So, in the end, we’ll
    have several values of mean estimation and then we can plot them on a chart.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First we take several samples (heights of different man) from our population
    and for each sample group we calculate the respective mean. For example, we can
    have groups where the height is 176 cm, others with 182cm, others with 172cm,
    and so on. We then plot this sample mean distribution. The following picture depicts
    the distribution of our several samples with the x mark, in each, referring to
    the mean value.

    towards the center of the sampling distribution. And amazingly, in the end, the
    mean of the sampling distribution will match the mean of the original distribution
    of the population.

    a normal distribution but later you can try with other shapes and even draw your
    own. We start by taking samples of size n=5 from the population and calculating
    the respective mean. As you increase the number of samples with n= 5 you see that
    the distribution of the means starts to be shaped like a normal distribution.
    When we increase the process several times in the thousands we get a normal distribution
    with a mean equal to the population’s mean. The more samples you get the more
    narrower the Normal distribution will be.

    samples then plot them in a sampling distribution then you’ll obtain a normal
