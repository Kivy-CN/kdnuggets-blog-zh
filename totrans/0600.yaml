    can be one of the sources of extracting data. An image can be defined as a matrix
    of pixels, and each pixel represents a color that can be treated as a data value.

    eight libraries or tools, the most used Python image manipulation or processing
    libraries are Pillow and OpenCV (SimplICV in some specific cases).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are thinking of building a project related to image processing, such
    as identifying objects or color manipulation, consider using the [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/)
    because it is a huge library with lots of advanced features. The other libraries
    also support some image manipulation or processing features but are not that efficient.
