    they are the same as in regular data. However, the big data characteristics we

    from more sources. Data is usually semi-structured or unstructured, which is transformed
    and stored differently than structured data.

    at high velocities and in various formats.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The three most distinct ways to store big data are NoSQL databases, data lakes,
    and data warehouses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NoSQL databases are designed for handling large volumes of structured and unstructured
    data without a fixed schema (NoSQL - Not Only SQL). This makes them adaptable
    to the evolving data structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike traditional, vertically scalable databases, NoSQL databases are horizontally
    scalable, meaning they can distribute data across multiple servers. Scaling becomes
    easier by adding more machines to the system. They are fault-tolerant, have low
    latency (appreciated in applications requiring real-time data access), and are
    cost-efficient at scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data lakes are storage repositories that store vast amounts of raw data in their
    native format. This simplifies data access and analytics, as all data is located
    in one place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data lakes are scalable and cost-efficient. They provide flexibility (data is
    ingested in its raw form, and the structure is defined when reading the data for
    analysis), support batch and real-time data processing, and can be integrated
    with data quality tools, leading to more advanced analytics and richer insights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data warehouse is a centralized repository optimized for analytical processing
    that stores data from multiple sources, transforming it into a format suitable
    for analysis and reporting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    relationships in large datasets. It involves disciplines like machine learning,
    statistics, and using database systems to extract insights from data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The amount of data mined is vast, and the sheer volume can reveal patterns that
    might not be apparent in smaller datasets. Big data usually comes from various
    sources and is often semi-structured or unstructured. This requires more sophisticated
    preprocessing and integration techniques. Unlike regular data, big data is usually
    processed in real time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tools used for big data mining have to handle all this. To do that, they apply
    distributed computing, i.e., data processing is spread across multiple computers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some algorithms might not be suitable for big data mining, as it requires scalable
    parallel processing algorithms, e.g., [SVM](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/machine-learning-algorithms-explained-support-vector-machine/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+big+data+tools),

  prefs: []
