    (ML) models isn''t enough. Organizations need to do more than build models — they
    need to successfully deploy, manage, and continuously improve these models in
    real-world scenarios. Imagine this: you''ve built a super-smart system to predict
    weather patterns, but unless you ensure it works every day and keeps getting smarter
    with new data, it''s like having a powerful tool gathering dust in a shed. That''s
    where MLOps steps in.'

- en: If you're curious about taking your MLOps skills to the next level and want
    to know how to turn your awesome models into real-world solutions, this article
    is your guide. I will introduce you to five free courses that break down MLOps
    into easy-to-understand bits. Whether you're starting fresh or you're already
    a pro in machine learning, there's a course here that fits just right for you.
