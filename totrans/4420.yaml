    GitHub repository describes itself like this:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of this repository is to build a comprehensive set of tools and examples
    that leverage recent advances in Computer Vision algorithms, neural architectures,
    and operationalizing such systems. Rather than creating implementions from scratch,
    we draw from existing state-of-the-art libraries and build additional utility
    around loading image data, optimizing and evaluating models, and scaling up to
    the cloud. In addition, having worked in this space for many years, we aim to
    answer common questions, point out frequently observed pitfalls, and show how
    to use the cloud for training and deployment.

    designed to highlight this "comprehensive set of tools and examples." The repo''s
    readme further emphasizes its fast iteration approach to practical solution implementations:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We hope that these examples and utilities can significantly reduce the “time
    to market” by simplifying the experience from defining the business problem to
    development of solution by orders of magnitude. In addition, the example notebooks
    would serve as guidelines and showcase best practices and usage of the tools in
    a wide variety of languages.

    computer vision scenarios, such as classification, segmentation, and crowd counting.
    Clicking on any of these scenarios takes you to the corresponding folder of recipes
    and best practices, an examples of which is shown below:'

    module "to simplify common tasks used when developing and evaluating computer
    vision systems." Be sure to check out the utilities developed by Microsoft Research
    which are intended to save time and speed up some of the more laborious tasks
    associated with computer vision.

- en: I'm not a computer vision expert, and have not spent as much time studying this
    area as a lot of other folks in machine learning. As such, I find resources like
    this one incredibly valuable. Whether you are in a similar situation, or you are
    a full time computer vision engineer looking for a handy collection of code to
    draw inspiration and ideas from, I suggest you check out this best practice-oriented
    repo from Microsoft.
