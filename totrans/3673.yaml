- en: Just to shake it up a little bit more, [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena)
    is an LLM benchmark platform created by the [Large Model Systems Organization](https://lmsys.org/)
    (LMSYS Org). It is an open research organization founded by students and faculty
    from UC Berkeley.

- en: Their overall aim is to make large models more accessible to everyone using
    a method of co-development using open datasets, models, systems, and evaluation
    tools. The team at LMSYS trains large language models and makes them widely available
    along with the development of distributed systems to accelerate the LLMs training
    and inference.

- en: With the continuous hype around ChatGPT, there has been rapid growth in open-source
    LLMs that have been fine-tuned to follow specific instructions. You have examples
    such as Alpaca and Vicuna, which are based on LLaMA and can provide assistance
    with user prompts.

- en: However, with anything this great that spurs out of control, it is difficult
    for the community to keep up with the constant new developments and be able to
    benchmark these models effectively. Benchmarking LLM assistants can be a challenge
    due to the possible open-ended issues.

- en: Therefore, human evaluation is required, using pairwise comparison. Pairwise
    comparison is the process of comparing the models in pairs to judge which model
    has better performance.

- en: In the Chatbot Arena, a user can chat with two anonymous models side-by-side
    and make their own opinion, and vote for which model is better. Once the user
    has voted, the name of the model will be revealed. Users have the option to continue
    to chat with the two models or start afresh with two new randomly chosen anonymous
    models.
  prefs: []

- en: You have the option to chat with two anonymous models side-by-side or pick the
    models you want to chat with. Below is a screenshot example of chatting with two
    anonymous models, in a LLM battle!

    The Elo rating system is a method used in games such as Chess to calculate the
    relative skill levels of players. The difference in rating between two users acts
    as a predictor of the outcome of that particular match.
