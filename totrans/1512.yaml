    every year for data companies. But what about automation?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are lots of avances in automation regarding machine learning, deep learning
    and deployment. But as I said before data is an important asset (maybe the most
    important one) for companies right now. So before you can apply machine learning
    or deep learning, at all, you need to have it, know what you have, understand
    it, govern it, clean it, analyze it, standardize it (maybe more) and then you
    can think of using it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need automation for data storage, data munging, data exploration, data cleansing
    and all the things we actually spend a lot time doing. You can say that tools
    like [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/) can offer you those things, but in
    my experience there’s much more to do in this field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s why my bet it’s that semantic technologies are the way to go here. With
    them (like [Anzo](https://www.cambridgesemantics.com/product/)) you have automatic
    query generation (yep that’s a thing) and using them against the complex graph
    makes extracting features easy and eventually fully automated.

    integrated within a business operation, processing current and historical data
    to prescribe actions in response to events. It provides decision automation or
    decision support.

    from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring, and make use of graph
    technologies.
