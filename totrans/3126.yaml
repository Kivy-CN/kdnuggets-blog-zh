- en: Most people learn Data Science with an emphasis on Programming. However, to
    be truly proficient with Data Science (and Machine Learning), you cannot ignore
    the mathematical foundations behind Data Science. In this post, I present seven
    books that I enjoyed in learning the mathematical foundations of Data Science.
     ‘Enjoy’ is perhaps not the best of words since this effort is hard going!

    backpropagation](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Geoffrey-Hinton-suspicious-of-backpropagation-and-wants-AI-to-start-over).
    Understanding the Maths will help you understand the evolution of AI better. It
    will help you distinguish from others who approach AI from a superficial level.
    It will also help you to see the Intellectual Property(IP) potential of AI better.
    Finally, understanding the Maths behind Data Science could also lead you to the
    higher end jobs in AI and Data Science.

    18 year olds. To understand the foundations of Maths for Data Science and AI,
    you need to know four things i.e. Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Multivariate
    Calculus, and Optimization. Most of these are taught (at least partially) in high
    schools. I am thus trying to relate high school maths to AI and Data Science with
    an emphasis on Mathematical modelling. Comments welcome on this approach.

    mathematicians! So, the first in my list is *The Nature of Statistical Learning
    Theory* by Vladimir Vapnik. Of all the books in this list, Vapnik is the hardest
    to find. I have an older Indian edition. Vladimir Vapnik is the creator of SVM.
    His [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vapnik) gives a lot
    more about his work.

    The book takes a pattern recognition approach and provides extensive coverage

    earliest books I have read (I only have the first edition). Both are very good.
    The second edition I believe has lot more code in Python. Like the first two books,
    this book also places a heavy emphasis on Algorithms.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Except for possibly the Goodfellow – Bengio book, I would not recommend reading
    the books cover to cover. I prefer to read the books by topic as needed i.e. as
    a reference book. I also like examples from different authors ex Duda for fish
    sorting; - Hastie - with advertising data sales TV and radio; Flach concept of
    hypothesis space with sea animals example etc
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I find that these books taught me a sense of humility i.e. How little we know
    and how vast and complex the field is
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These books are timeless. Vladimir Vapnik is now aged 81\. Duda was published
    first in 1973\. I expect 50 years from now, the industry would still be reading
    them. Like old friends who have stood the test of time. That’s a comforting thought.
    It shows the longevity of the maths based approach.
