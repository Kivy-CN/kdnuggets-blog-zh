- en: Building large scale ML solutions is nothing short of a nightmare. Even if you
    have the perfect architecture, highly scalable ML pipelines typically require
    combining many infrastructure platforms and frameworks that are not precisely
    designed for seamless integration. The process of orchestrating different ML tools
    results challenging even for the most experienced ML developers. Microsoft Research
    just open sourced a new framework designed to address this challenge.

- en: SynapseML is the new version of MMLSpark, an open source library designed from
    the ground up to implement massively scalable ML pipelines. Functionally, SynapseML
    extends the capabilities of Apache Spark to better support requirements of massively
    scalable ML solutions. The platform uses a distributed programming model to distribute
    a given ML workload across thousands of machines while ensuring that the GPUs-CPUs
    are utilized at full capacity. More importantly, SynapseML manages to achieve
    that using a single API that underneath can rely on frameworks like LightGBM or
    XGBoost.

- en: SynapseML API provides a data, platform and language agnostic model to interact
    with ML frameworks. This allows ML engineers to rapidly orchestrate different
    ML tools and frameworks without sacrificing the developer experience. Another
    important aspect of the API is that abstracts the underlying file and database
    interactions.

- en: Adding a nice distribution touch to the SynapseML release, Microsoft added the
    framework to the Azure Synapse Analytics platform. This ensures that the platform
    is available as a native Azure service with the corresponding enterprise support.
    SynapseML is one of the most interesting efforts to prevent the increasing fragmentation
    in the ML tools and frameworks market. Its going to be interesting to track how
    this platform is received and adopted by the ML community.
