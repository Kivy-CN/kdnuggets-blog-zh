    highly in demand right now, and if you are someone who is able to derive value
    from large amounts of data, you can take up many high paying tasks outside a traditional
    full-time job.

    to work in different domains with people from all over the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best part about taking up freelance data science jobs is the ability to
    work from home at my own pace. I get to handpick the tasks I’d enjoy doing, and
    reject jobs I find uninteresting. I also find that my communication skills have
    improved dramatically as I’ve had to converse and translate findings to people
    who come from diverse backgrounds.

- en: Many small organizations and startups don’t have a data science team in place.
    These companies prefer to save cost by outsourcing their data science work to
    an external hire on a contract basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that not only will you be working with these companies to build models
    on a one-off basis, but you’d also be required to continuously monitor performance
    and update the algorithm with new data when required.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your services over a longer period of time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many organizations rely on third-party data for competitor intelligence, building
    pricing models, performing sentiment analysis, and staying ahead of other players
    in the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A freelance task like this would require you to use APIs to collect data. I
    once had to collect Twitter data with the help of an API for a client who required
    social sentiment data over the past 5 years to generate stock market predictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the complexity of the data collection task, you might also need
    to crawl the web to extract information from websites. I’ve scraped pricing, review,
    and product data for a few different companies in the past. In some cases, it
    sufficed to store this data in an Excel sheet. Other clients wanted me to create
    and regularly update a database consisting of all the scraped information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Web scraping is an incredibly useful skill to have, since many organizations
    don’t have internal data and rely almost entirely on publicly available data sources
    to gather intel. If you aren’t familiar with scraping and would like to learn
    it, I suggest starting with [this](http://datacamp.pxf.io/ZdzgYz) DataCamp course
    that will take you through data collection with Python and BeautifulSoup.

- en: Market research is a field that involves sizing up a company’s target audience
    to gather information about potential customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past, most market research was done by marketing professionals, who would
    conduct surveys, interviews, and create customer focus groups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, these methods come with their drawbacks. Surveys can provide companies
    with biased results depending on the nature of the audience they are sent out
    to. They aren’t always indicative of the true population. Furthermore, potential
    consumers can always respond to surveys incorrectly due to time constraints, especially
    if there is a completion reward involved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, some forms of market research require you to work with large amounts of
    external data collected from online sources. And while marketing experts might
    be great at interpreting this data, they might not have the skills required to
    analyze it due to their lack of data literacy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The factors above have led to a shift in the role of a market researcher. Nowadays,
    companies are on the lookout for someone who possesses data analysis skills and
    marketing domain knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve worked with a few companies on market research tasks in the past. My job
    usually started with collecting publicly available data, cleaning it, and storing
    it. Then, I would perform an analysis of this data and attempt to interpret it
    using some marketing domain knowledge. Finally, I’d come up with overall market
    insight and relevant recommendations, which I’d hand over to the company’s product
    or marketing team to take action upon.

    some domain knowledge in market research or marketing analytics, [here](http://datacamp.pxf.io/jWJGeb)

- en: Data science and analytics skills are highly in demand nowadays. And it isn’t
    just data science aspirants who are trying to learn the subject; even non-technical
    executives in organizations struggle to work with quantitative data, and are willing
    to attend training programs in the field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don’t need to be an expert at every aspect of data science to become an
    instructor in the field. For example, if you aren’t well versed with machine learning
    modelling but have extensive knowledge of SQL, you can just choose to teach a
    beginner level SQL class for newcomers to the industry.

    Upwork, but these platforms were simply too competitive. Every project I was willing
    to take up, there were at least five other people willing to bid for the job at
    a lower rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    my work to a wide range of people on LinkedIn. I also signed up to platforms like
    Medium, where I wrote articles describing the projects I’d worked on in the past.
  prefs: []

    about it on Medium. I didn’t expect many people to read it. The next day, however,
    an employer reached out to me on LinkedIn asking me if I’d be available to work
    on a segmentation project for his company. It’s been over a year, and I still
    work with this person on many different projects on a contract basis.

    is vital to get into freelancing, especially in a competitive field like data
    science.
  prefs: []

- en: Once you’ve worked for multiple clients and built a strong portfolio, ask your
    customers for positive feedback and high ratings on freelance platforms. This
    will help you get noticed easily on these sites, and you can land future gigs
    even without having to bid for jobs.
