    learning has become a topic of considerable interest over the past several months.
    A [recent KDnuggets blog competition](/2016/06/kdnuggets-blog-contest-automated-data-science.html)
    focused on this topic, and generated a handful of interesting ideas and projects.
    Of note, our readers were introduced to [Auto-sklearn](/2016/08/winning-automl-challenge-auto-sklearn.html),
    an automated machine learning pipeline generator, via the competition, and learned
    more about the project in a [follow-up interview](/2016/10/interview-auto-sklearn-automated-data-science-machine-learning-team.html)
    with its developers.'

    "your data science assistant," an open source Python tool that intelligently automates
    the entire machine learning process.

    can automatically optimize a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning
    models that maximize the dataset's cross-validation accuracy, and outputs the
    optimal model as Python code leveraging scikit-learn. The machine learning pipeline
    generation and optimization project is helmed by well-known and prolific machine
    learning and data science personality [Randy Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/about/).

    especially on large data sets. Currently, TPOT can take hours or even days to
    finish on large (50,000+ record) data sets, which can make it difficult to use
    for some users. We have a whole bag of tricks to speed up TPOT --- including parallelizing
    TPOT on multi-core computing systems --- so it's just a matter of time until we
    get those features rolled out.

    half of my job involves working with Penn physicians and drawing insight from
    the biomedical data sets they've collected. Every single time I approach a new
    data set --- and after I've finished the initial data cleaning and exploratory
    data analysis --- I run at least a dozen instances of TPOT on our computing cluster
    to see whether TPOT can discover a useful model of the data. While TPOT runs,
    I still explore a handful of simpler models by hand myself, but TPOT has saved
    me a ton of time when I need to delve into more complex models, which I rarely
    need to run by hand anymore.

    study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16311243) that my boss, Prof. Jason
    H. Moore, had collaborated on years ago. We wanted to see whether we could replicate
    the findings in the study, so we used a custom version of TPOT to find the best
    model for us. After just a few hours of tinkering with the models, TPOT replicated
    the findings in the original study and found the same pipeline that took his collaborators
    weeks to figure out. As an added bonus, TPOT discovered a more complex pipeline
    that actually *improved* upon what his collaborators found by discovering a new
    interaction between two of the variables. If only they had TPOT back then, eh?

    machine learning model-building process: once a data set is in a (relatively)
    clean format, the AutoML system will be able to design and optimize a machine
    learning pipeline faster than 99% of the humans out there. Perhaps AutoML systems
    will be able to expand out to cover a larger portion of the data cleaning process,
    but many tasks --- such as being able to pose a problem as a machine learning
    problem in the first place --- will remain solely a human endeavor in the near
    future. However, technologists are infamously [bad at predicting the future of
    technology](http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertszczerba/2015/01/05/15-worst-tech-predictions-of-all-time/#23703b1625c1),

    that AutoML systems *will* become mainstream in the machine learning world, and
    it''s highly likely that the AutoML systems of the future will be interactive.
    Instead of the user and AutoML system working independently, the user and AutoML
    system will work together: as the user tries out different pipelines by hand,
    the AutoML system will learn in real-time from the user''s experience and adapt
    its optimization process. Instead of providing one recommendation at the end of
    the optimization process, the AutoML system will continually recommend the best
    pipelines it''s discovered so far and allow the user to provide feedback on those
    pipelines --- feedback that is then incorporated into the AutoML optimization
    process. And so on. In essence, AutoML systems will become akin to "Data Science
    Assistants" that can combine the tremendous computing power of high-performance
    computing systems with the problem-solving ability of human designers.'

    as intelligent code autocompletion tools aren''t intended to replace computer
    programmers. Rather, to me the purpose of AutoML is to free data scientists from
    the burden of repetitive and time-consuming tasks (e.g., machine learning pipeline
    design and hyperparameter optimization) so they can better spend their time on
    tasks that are much more difficult to automate. For example, parsing a heterogeneous
    HTML file into a clean data set or translating a "human problem" into a "machine
    learning problem" are relatively simple tasks for experienced data scientists,
    yet are currently out of reach for AutoML systems. My motto: "Automate the boring
    stuff so we can focus on the interesting stuff."'
