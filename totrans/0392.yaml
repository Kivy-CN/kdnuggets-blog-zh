    the ImageNet competition, effectively kickstarting the machine learning and data-modelling
    wave we are now living through. It’s fair to say that this birthed some of the
    earliest generations of data-first companies.

    of relevant companies I would have to look through. In particular, I only considered
    companies whose websites included at least one of the following terms: AI, CV,
    NLP, natural language processing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine,
    ML, data. I also disregarded companies whose website links were broken.'

    jobs (typically a *Careers*, *Jobs*, or *We’re Hiring* page), and took note of
    every role that included data, machine learning, NLP, or CV in the title. This
    gave me a pool of about 70 distinct companies hiring for data roles.

    certain websites with very little information (typically those in stealth) that
    might actually be hiring. In addition, there were companies that didn’t have a
