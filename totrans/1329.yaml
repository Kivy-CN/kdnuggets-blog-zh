    through implementation. If you haven’t learned already, this book will teach you
    programming. Unlike other programming books, we provide extensive illustrations
    and exercises from NLP. The approach we have taken is also principled, in that
    we cover the theoretical underpinnings and don’t shy away from careful linguistic
    and computational analysis. We have tried to be pragmatic in striking a balance
    between theory and application, identifying the connections and the tensions.
    Finally, we recognize that you won’t get through this unless it is also pleasurable,
    so we have tried to include many applications and examples that are interesting
    and entertaining, sometimes whimsical.'
