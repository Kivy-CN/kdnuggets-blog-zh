    uneven. For instance, a model that merely predicts the majority class will be
    99% accurate if the dominant class comprises 99% of the data. Unfortunately, it
    will not be able to appropriately classify the minority class. Other metrics including
    precision, recall, and F1-score should be used to address this issue.

    learning model's performance, but it can be deceptive. To acquire a more thorough
    perspective of the model's performance, additional metrics including precision,
    recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix should also be used. To overcome issues
    like imbalanced classes, overfitting, and data bias, techniques including cross-validation,
    normalisation, data augmentation, and re-sampling should be applied.
