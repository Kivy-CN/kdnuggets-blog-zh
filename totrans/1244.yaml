- en: When you start pursuing a job in data science, some skills to acquire will be
    obvious. You know you’ll need experience in coding, analytics and mathematics,
    but you should also cultivate some soft skills. While these may not come to mind
    immediately when you think of data science, they’ll play a critical role in your
    career.

    albeit slower than other occupations. The field’s profitability will also draw
    more applicants, so competition is rising. If you want to stand out among your
    fellow applicants, here are some supporting skills you should develop.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many jobs will look for applicants with strong critical thinking skills, especially
    in data science. You should be able to see a problem from multiple perspectives,
    understand how to approach it and analyze your results. This process is the foundation
    for many data science applications, even if it isn’t unique to the industry.

- en: As a data scientist, you need to know how to frame a question correctly, not
    just answer it. You have to analyze an issue from multiple angles to find the
    root of the problem. After resolving something, you should reflect on the process
    and understand why it proceeded the way it did.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To develop critical thinking skills, take on various problem-solving projects
    in your spare time. Try approaching them from multiple perspectives and demonstrating
    a diversity of methods in resolving them. Cultivating a portfolio of these projects
    can show potential employers your knack for critical thinking.

- en: You may not think of data science as a communication-heavy field, but that’s
    far from the truth. While analysis may be the core of your work, you have to communicate
    your results. Data science involves a lot of collaboration and reporting, so you
    should know how to do so effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Studies suggest that inadequate communication costs large companies [$62.4 million
    a year](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/communication/pages/the-cost-of-poor-communications.aspx)
    on average. If you can’t explain your problems or ideas to co-workers and management,
    they won’t see the full extent of your technical abilities. Miscommunication can
    lead to unoptimized processes, shortcomings and losses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thankfully, developing and showcasing communication skills is relatively straightforward.
    As you go throughout your work and personal life, seek team projects. The more
    you work in a group, the better you’ll become at communicating, and you’ll have
    evidence of it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good data scientist will look for solutions to problems, but a great one will
    seek things to fix. Data science is a potentially disruptive field, so you should
    be able to think outside of traditional frameworks. Intellectual curiosity drives
    data scientists to find under-the-radar issues and solve them creatively.
  prefs: []

- en: Employers want a data scientist with a drive to learn more. This frame of mind
    helps find solutions and can lead to company expansion. Curiosity drives growth,
    so any business will be happy to find an intellectually curious candidate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To cultivate intellectual curiosity, start asking questions. Pursue independent
    projects and ask why and how at every step of the process. Over time, you’ll develop
    a portfolio full of unique problem-solving approaches and a history of curiosity.

- en: While it’s easy to think of the sciences as rigid, you’ll have to be adaptable
    as a data scientist. Adaptability is desirable in virtually any skilled trade,
    as employees often [gain new skills on the job](https://www.commercialvanshelving.com/blog/skilled-trade-jobs-highest-demand/),
    meeting diverse needs. The more you can shift to meet new challenges, the more

    yourself to various situations. As a tech-centric field, data science is also
    always evolving. New technologies and methods emerge regularly, and you’ll have
    to be able to adapt to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can develop adaptability by intentionally putting yourself in unfamiliar
    situations. Start some projects in an area you’re less comfortable or knowledgeable
    in. Volunteer to be part of new projects or processes in your current job or at
    school. You’ll learn how to evolve in the process.

    feel better, and your work will improve.
  prefs: []

    with schoolwork. Test different strategies, like setting timers and prioritizing
    essential tasks, and find a method or combination that works best for you. You
    can then explain to potential employers how you use these to manage your time
    effectively.
