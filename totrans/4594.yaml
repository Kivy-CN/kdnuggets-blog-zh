    Note how we are accessing the plot methods by putting a simple **.DOT** i.e. `Diagnostics_plot.histogram_resid`.
    Just like accessing a function from Pandas or NumPy library!

    the OOP paradigm is to [**be able to modularize your code**](https://atomicobject.com/resources/oo-programming/encapsulation-modularity).

    But for maximum modularity, consider converting the Notebook into a standalone
    executable Python script (with a .py extension). As a good practice, remove all
    the unnecessary comments and test code from this file and keep only the classes
    together.
