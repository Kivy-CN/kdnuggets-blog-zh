    relevant material. Among the few I found, most were either too domain specific
    or completely focused on visual designs of web UIs. The best articles I have came
    across on this subject matter were [Vladimir Shapiro](https://medium.com/@vshapiro24)’s
    “[UX for AI: Trust as a Design Challenge](https://medium.com/sap-design/ux-for-ai-trust-as-a-design-challenge-62044e22c4ec)”

    UX: 7 Principles of Designing Good AI Products](https://uxstudioteam.com/ux-blog/ai-ux/)”.
    Realizing that there is a legitimate knowledge gap between UX Designers and Data
    Scientists, I have decided to attempt addressing the needs from the Data Scientist’s
    perspective. Hence, my assumption is that the readers have some basic understanding
    of data science. For UX Designers **with little to no data science background**,
    I have avoided the use of complex mathematics and programming (though I do encourage
    reading [Michael Galarnyk](https://towardsdatascience.com/@GalarnykMichael)’s
    “[How to Build a Data Science Portfolio](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-data-science-portfolio-5f566517c79c)”

    explainable by nature. We can analyze the weight coefficients, visualize trees
    or calculate the entropy to anticipate major contributions to the final prediction
    (details [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/study-of-decision-trees-and-ensembles-on-scikit-learn-e713a8e532b8)).
    While in the past, most business problems relied on simple explainable models,
    “black box” models like Neural Network have started becoming very popular. This
    is because Neural Networks provide much higher accuracy at lower costs for problems
    having complex decision boundaries (e.g. image and voice recognition). However,
    Neural Networks are a lot hard to explain compared to most traditional models.
    This is especially true for teams with non-technical players as analyzing a neural
    network is a non-trivial task.

    input. For example, the model may not have a feature for ice being present on
    the road. However, if the presence of water on the road and the road’s surface
    temperature are being picked up by the model as inputs, we can intuitively say
    that the existence of ice can be derived by the hidden layers through feature
    engineering. [Tesla’s autopilot resulting in a fatal accident](https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-self-driving-crash-california/) is
    just one example of why we need explainable AI in the field of self-driving vehicles.

    the British philosopher [Onora O’Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onora_O%27Neill) points
    to the three components of trust: *competence*, *honesty* and *reliability*. Being
    upfront shows the client that we are competent, honest and reliable enough to

    score may only be taking assets of value larger than $2000 into account. Hence,
    any asset lower than $2000 will not be taken into account by the model when calculating
    your score. Similar case with cyber-security products. You cannot expect the model
    to monitor DDoS attacks if it is collecting data at a daily or weekly rate.
