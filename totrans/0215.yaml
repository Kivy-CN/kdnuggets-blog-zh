    that I get to see every day. I see Photoshop plugins for Art generation, web apps
    that provide AI editing, software that replaces objects from photos, and 3D Diffusion.
    [DALLE-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
    models have changed the AI space forever.
