    fingertips, like Udemy courses, YouTube videos, and articles. But you need to
    give yourself a clear structure of what you should study to avoid feeling overwhelmed
    and losing motivation.

    this book can be a good match for you. It gives a very short overview of Python’s
    basic concepts. Together with the 100-page book, there is also a GitHub repository
    with exercises.

    putting into practice what you study.  The beauty of this book is that it’s focused
    on a few basic concepts and doesn’t only show theory, but there are also practical
    exercises written with Python.

- en: When you study Linear Algebra in university, most of the time the professors
    explain all the theory without any practical application. So, you end up taking
    the exam, and forget every concept once you are done, because in your head it’s
    too abstract.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily, I have found this amazing book that gives you a good introduction of
    linear algebra’s fundamentals that you’ll meet when you study machine learning
    models. Every theoretical concept is followed by a practical example written with
    NumPy, a well-known Python library for scientific computing.

    science field. Moreover, they can be useful for data scientists and researchers
    that are aware of having a lack of knowledge on some concepts and need to strengthen
    their understanding. I hope that you have appreciated this list of books. Do you
    know other helpful books about Data Science? Drop them in the comments if you
    have insightful suggestions.
