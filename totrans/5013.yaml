- en: The [Jupyter Notebook](http://www.jupyter.org/) is a fantastic tool that can
    be used in many different ways. Because of its flexibility, working with the Notebook
    on data science problems in a team setting can be challenging. We present here
    some best-practices that SVDS has implemented after working with the Notebook
    in teams and with our clients—and that might help your data science teams as well.

    getting in each other’s way, has been a tricky one to meet. We present here our
    current view into a system that works for us—and that might help your data science
    teams as well.

- en: When we do our analysis, we do internal reviews of our code and our data science
    output. We do this with a traditional pull-request approach. When issuing pull-requests,
    however, looking at the differences between updated .ipynb files, the updates
    are not rendered in a helpful way. One solution people tend to recommend is to
    commit the conversion to .py instead. This is great for seeing the differences
    in the input code (while jettisoning the output), and is useful for seeing the
    changes. However, when reviewing data science work, it is also incredibly important
    to see the output itself.

    lack the nice rendering capabilities. There are options for deploying an instance
    of nbviewer behind the corporate firewall, but sometimes that still is not an
    option. If you find yourself in this situation, and you want to maintain the above
    framework of reviewing code we have a workaround. In these situations, we commit
    the .ipynb, .py, and .html of every notebook in each commit. Creating the .py
    and .html files can be done simply and automatically every time a notebook is
    saved by editing the jupyter config file and adding a post-save hook.

    which input text has changed, while having the .html files lets a person quickly
    see which outputs have changed. Having this be a painless post-save-hook makes
    this workflow effortless.
