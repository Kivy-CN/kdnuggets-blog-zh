    thesis prepared by A.Disbudak. The survey sought to evaluate the relevance of
    Machine Learning in operations today, assess the current state of Machine Learning
    adoption and to identify tools used for Machine Learning. The 140 qualified respondents
    represented a variety of company sizes from very small (one-person startups) to
    very large (multinationals with more than 10,000 employees).

    called Machine Learning, is the next big development powering the business world
    (Raconteur, 2015). Various businesses are developing strategies for technology
    adoption and already realizing genuine return on investment (ROI) (Insights, 2017).

    like an overnight development, but the buzz around this technology has been steadily
    growing since the early days of big data in 2005\. ML systems are used to help
    computers identify patterns from big data sets and enable them to perform tasks,
    such as predicting consumer behavior and forecasting how people will react to
    different marketing strategies (Raconteur, 2015). This technology holds the key
    to unlocking the value of big data. Innovation-minded business leaders are embracing
    ML as “the next big thing” and have already crafted ML strategies and initiatives
    that promise real benefits and ROI (Pettey & Meulen, 2018).

    Amazon) have built their businesses by gaining access to huge amounts of data
    about customers and their online behavior (Raconteur, 2015). In addition NATU
    Companies (Netflix, Airbnb, Tesla, Uber) or BATX companies (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent,
    Xiaomi) have all developed powerful Machine Learning capabilities with in-house
    platforms and models. The more data they gain access to, the better their Machine
    Learning performs. However, these Machine Learning capabilities are not easily
    accessible to most companies. They need to obtain different methods of accessing
    Machine Learning capabilities, so they can put their own unique and valuable data
    assets to work. The recent emergence of a new generation of Machine Learning platforms
    is set to make Machine Learning far more accessible to businesses of all types
    and sizes across all industries.

    Machine Learning and Deep Learning technologies into a new realm. Forrester forecasts
    that AI will attract three times more corporate investment during 2017 (Press,
    2016). At the same time smaller companies claim to be more advanced in their AI
    developments due to the fact that they use AI as a core of their businesses from
    day one.

    processes to meet their strategic digital transformation goals. If the organization
    remains hesitant, it will miss the valuable opportunities that Machine Learning
    technology offers businesses today. According to Accenture, managers are more
    willing to put their trust in an intelligent system if they understand how it
    works (Accenture, The promise of artificial intelligence report, 2016).

    This means that best practices are still being established. Machine Learning is
    mostly viewed as an R&D effort, and the infrastructure required for productionizing
    models is not yet accessible. Big companies have an advantage as opposed to smaller
    companies due to access to the data, budgets for R&D and variety of Machine Learning
    cases. Google was the first to provide market with countless data cleaning and
    model training solutions, called Hadoop.

    strategy and execution, data scientists find themselves in heavy demand (AI Strategy,
    Forbes, 2019).
