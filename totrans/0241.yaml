    with assets in order to make a profit. All technical analysis is based on statistical
    data, on the behavior and reactions of the market in the past. Consequently, the

    direction, the capabilities of bots have become insufficient. In automated trading,
    they began to be replaced by machines that, with the same performance, can still

    However, the peculiarity of artificial intelligence is that the technology is
