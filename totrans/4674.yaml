    of demand, usage, and popularity in [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-framework-power-scores-2018-23607ddf297a).
    TensorFlow was the undisputed heavyweight champion of deep learning frameworks.
    PyTorch was the young rookie with lots of buzz. ????

    PyTorch is more pythonic and has a more consistent API. It also has native [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools)
    model exports, which can be used to speed up inference. Also, PyTorch shares many
    commands with [numpy](https://github.com/wkentaro/pytorch-for-numpy-users), which
    reduces the barrier to learning it.

    TensorFlow will now have a more straightforward API, a streamlined Keras integration,
    and an eager execution option. These changes, and TensorFlow’s broad adoption,
    should help the framework remain popular for years to come.

    over Python in terms of execution and development speed. Fast.ai will be using
    [Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift) in part of its advanced
    MOOC — see fast.ai cofounder Jeremy Howard’s post on the topic [here](https://www.fast.ai/2019/03/06/fastai-swift/).
