  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are given a dataset and your manager asks you to perform data analysis,
    what would you do? Usually, people forget the business objective or what we are
    trying to achieve by analyzing the data and directly jump into using Python packages
    to visualize the data and make sense of it. This can lead to wasted resources
    and inconclusive results. Without clear goals, it is easy to get lost in the data
    and miss the insights that truly matter.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Neglecting foundational steps like data cleaning, transforming, and understanding
    every feature in the dataset can lead to flawed analysis and inaccurate assumptions.
    Most data scientists don't even understand statistical formulas and just use Python
    code to perform exploratory data analysis. This is the wrong approach. You need
    to pick what statistical method you want to use for the specific use case.

    matter? No. If your data visualization does not communicate the information properly,
    then it is useless, and sometimes it can mislead stakeholders.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When building the model data, scientists will focus on data cleaning, transformation,
    model selection, and ensembling. They will forget to perform the most important
    step: feature engineering. Features are the inputs that drive model predictions,
    and poorly chosen features can lead to suboptimal results.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prioritizing accuracy over other performance metrics can lead to biased models
    that perform poorly in production environments. High accuracy does not always
    equate to a good model, especially if it overfits the data or performs well on
    major labels but poorly on minor ones.
