    be doing data science and everyone claims to be a data scientist. Practitioners
    are puzzled by their fuzzy job descriptions, and people who are trying to become
    data scientists are frustrated by the lack of standard definitions. In this conversation,
    at Toronto Machine Learning Summit 2017, we have tried to demystify data science
    and clarify what it means to be a data scientist.'

    solve business problems. *“A good data scientist in my mind is the person that
    takes the science part in data science very seriously; a person who is able to
    find problems and solve them using statistics, machine learning, and distributed
    computing.”* said Amir Hajian, Director of Research at Thomson Reuters Labs. In
    other words, data scientists are people who can *“reason through data using inferential
    reasoning, think in terms of probabilities, be scientific and systematic, and
    make data work at scale using software engineering best practices,”* said Baiju
    Devani, Vice President of Analytics at Aviva. He added that It is important to
    recognize that, *“there is no deterministic path to the problems you're solving
    or the solutions you find, so you have to be ok with fuzziness,”* He also states
    that you need to, “have that experimental mindset that allows you to work with
    vague problem and solution definitions.” In some sense, the best data scientists
    are people with “*good statistical knowledge, programming and technical skills,
    and industry experience*” according to  Lindsay Farber, Senior Data Scientist
    at MoneyKey.

    in business there is a need “*to step back and get educated about what data science
    really is. It is the use of data to address business problems which sometimes
    means there is no need to use machine learning or artificial intelligence.*” Part
    of the misunderstandings that exists around data science originate from the hype
    that exists. Every business is in rush to get into data science without taking
    the time to understand why and how. Big companies are in a fierce competition
    to hire as many data scientists as they can without taking the foundational steps
    needed. “*If you have 100-200 data scientists (compared to say Facebook who has
    500-600 data scientists), you are in the wrong business*”, said Baiju Devani.
    He added “*while these organizations have big problems to solve through data science
    or machine learning, they have not thought about operationalization to bring those
    solutions at scale.*” On the other hand, there are startups who are too eager
    to solve everything with machine learning without thinking about the proper scale
    of the problems. “*If you are a startup with a thousand clients, you should not
    be doing sentiment analysis instead of calling and talking to every one of your
    clients,*” said Baiju Devani. Practitioners are also rushing into becoming data
    scientists without understanding what it means. “*Everyone who has taken a few
    online courses thinks they have transitioned without putting nearly enough time
    and effort into it,*” said Ozge Yeloglu.

    interesting business use cases that have been creating an excitement in the industry.
    “*I really feel happy when our clients come to us with a real data business problem
    and we can help them with our resources while leveraging their domain knowledge;
    that makes me optimistic that the hype can get us to the reality sooner than later,*”
    said Ozge Yeloglu. “*Organizations want to find this new way of of doing business
    in a new direction that was not possible before,*” said Amir Hajian. He added
    that practitioners want to be data scientists because “*they want jobs that do
    not end, and are not repeating the same thing over and over again every day.*”
    He said “*it is the perfect time for people who are not computer scientists but
    want to get into the industry and do something good.*” This is, afterall, a field
    that is not as rigid; “*it is changing and it's finding its own way and it's evolving
    so you have to be ready for that and you have to find your favorite thing and
    your niche and and you have to keep going.*”

    to increase the likelihood of success as a data-driven business. One of the most
    important steps is to “*ask what the objective is and why you need data science,
    and you need to keep asking why until you get a good answer to do that and then
    the rest falls into place,*” said Baiju Devani. Next step is to create an efficient
    data science team. The core of the team should come from the business itself,
    rather than any new hires. “*If you can find that one person in your team who
    is a domain expert already and understands the data and most likely is already
    doing traditional Business Intelligence, and if they want to become the data scientist,
    let them be and invest in them,*” said Ozge Yeloglu. Once that core is formed
    and depending on the priority, timeframe, and the complexity of the problem you
    might end up hiring people with various skill sets. Most of the time the best
    solution is to have a data engineer to build the infrastructure and then a data
    scientist on top of it in addition to the business domain experts. In fact, “*for
    every data scientists there are other roles that you need: data visualization
    experts, developers, and UI/UX designers,*” said Amir Hajian.'

    of backgrounds and mentalities provides the right ingredient to be successful.
    “*We''ve talked a lot about data science being a science but I think it''s as
    much artistic and requires a lot of creativity and it is clear from research that
    diversity leads to creativity,*” said Baiju Devani. “*At my company I had to work
    with other data scientists in my team to come up with better answers,*” said Lindsay
    Farber. “*It is  hard work that is beyond coming up with an algorithm: you have
    to clean the data, talk to the customer, build the whole model and then present
    it to the stakeholders, and be patient and come up with different ways of putting
    it in front of the customer and explaining it to them; that''s where you see that
    people who have different technical backgrounds can make a huge impact because
    they are looking at things differently and and they have the expertise,*” said
    Amir Hajian.This is especially important in terms of social, gender and racial
    diversity for companies in public sector or social innovation. “*One story that
    I heard recently was about one group that built a model for detecting a disease
    and it worked great in training, but failed when tested in real life; their training
    data was all for white Caucasian and it was failing on all Latino population and
    African Americans and Asians; it was an eye-opener for companies who have social
    impact that if your team looks the same then they''re gonna think the same,*”
    said Ozge Yeloglu.'

    will certainly lead into failure. So far, it should be clear how different technical
    roles and expertise along with soft skills intertwine to create a team that can
    achieve great objectives in data science. Selecting individuals to join such a
    team is a great challenge and needs to be done with care. “*To me team culture
    is one of the biggest things, so I look for the fit for my team and for our clients.
    In my team data scientists are technical people with very high communication skills
    who can talk with people ranging from data scientists to VPs and CIOs. A typical
    question that I ask in interviews is a very open-ended case study and see if the
    candidate is able to ask the right questions, and figure out what the right technical
    solution is, and I observe that thought process end to end.*” said Ozge Yeloglu.
    She added “*obviously, technical skill is important but as long as they know Python
    or R, I trust that they're gonna keep learning and improving. This is important
    because data science is one of those areas that keeps growing, so you can't really
    stay static.*” Another important thing that hiring managers should look into in
    interviews is the ability of the candidate to brainstorm and work with them and
    with the team. “*I try to have a conversation to see if you are able to hold a
    conversation around data science beyond whatever technically you are good at.
    If we go beyond that I tend to pick up a paper and send it to the candidate and
    ask them to come in for a paper review. I think that works well, like an oral
    exam, better than having a time-pressured write-your-sort-algorithm,*” said Baiju
    Devani. It is also crucial to find people who are good at teamwork. “*I want to
    stress that having the communications skill with the head of marketing or the
    head of operations and everyone else in the company is really important. You need
    to talk to them to understand their data needs and show them what they need to
    see even though they might not necessarily be able to describe it,*” said Lindsay
    Farber. A great way to test for many of the important skills is to ask the candidates
    to walk the interviewer through one of their most interesting projects. “*I have
    discovered the best candidates that way and it never fails because that immediately
    gives the candidate hands to show you what exactly they can do and what technology
    they know, and how they think about problems, and how they communicate. You can
    see that there are some people who can't do it and some people who come ready
    and open their laptops and show you what they have built,*” said Amir Hajian.

    important. That causes a big contradiction as there is almost no experienced data
    scientist out in the market. Majority of people looking for data science jobs
    are right out of school and therefore don't have the business experience needed.
    “*If you're lacking that industry experience I think doing Andrew Ng’s course
    and learning Python or working with really clean unrealistic data sets from Kaggle
    is one way to do it, but I think to build on that you need to get out there, come
    to meetups and summits, talk to other data scientists to find out what they do,
    and take a course in person. That helps you understand what different types of
    data scientists do,*” said Lindsay Farber. She also thought it is important not
    to aim too high for the first job; “*just get into a company at a junior level
    and work your way up. When you show interest and work hard, you will have that
    data analytics and data science background and the business insight to create
    a job for yourself.*” It is also crucial to tell others what is special about
    you beyond things that every can do like taking online courses. A good way to
    do that is “*to pick a problem that you're interested in and start building something
    around it. Teach yourself everything that you need to solve that problem. That
    makes the process of learning fun and you'll start learning all the technologies
    and the science you need as a data scientist*”, said Amir Hajian. You can do that
    if you are coming from academia or if you are already working in industry and
    looking into switching to data science. “*You should find that one extended project
    that is not in your job description but it will push you to get into the data
    science world. You can actually use your company's data, real-world data, and
    get experience that way and then you can show that you have the potential and
    desire,*” said Ozge Yeloglu. If you have a Kaggle competition dataset, go ahead
    and think outside of the box and figure out what else you can do with it. Even
    augment that with so many open-source datasets that exist and hopefully something
    interesting comes out of it.

    and how companies monitor for that. The other side of the coin are people who
    are considering jobs and companies to join and they should ask questions in interviews
    or even before getting to the interviews when they''re collecting info about the
    company. “*The most interesting thing I heard when I was looking for a data science
    job was that when the interviewer is interviewing you, you are also interviewing
    the interviewer. That is your chance to find out what life is going to be like
    at this role. The important questions are: ‘who am I going to work with?’, ‘what
    is the team like’, and ‘what are the problems that you''re solving’. Ask them
    to walk you through the most exciting project that they have recently done and
    and listen very carefully and ask a lot of questions about it because that will
    show you everything about that company and that team*”, said Amir Hajian. An important
    point to remember in such conversations is that people work for managers not necessarily
    the company. “*Your manager is really the immediate person that you''re gonna
    deal with every day and they''re gonna decide your success in that company one
    way or another. So I think it''s really important to get a call with the hiring
    manager. Even if you''re not lined up for that call ask the recruiter for it.
    Then actually learn from that person and and see if you connect with them,*” said
    Ozge Yeloglu. She added “*I really love it when someone asks me about the growth
    opportunities because that tells me that they are aware that this is not an easy
    job and they have to really keep learning every day.*” It is also important for
    people to research what the company and the team they want to join do beforehand.
    “*Go on YouTube and see if any of the data scientists have given talks recently
    and watch all of them; see if they''ve published any papers read them and so that
    you bring that up in the interview instead of them telling you about it and then
    you can showcase your knowledge,*” said Lindsay Farber. It might be slightly harder
    but you should also “*try to figure out if you can talk to people who the data
    science team works with closely whether that''s on the business side or most likely
    from the engineering side. Figure out how well the engineering and data science
    teams work together and what kind of dynamics there are,*” said Baiju Devani.'

    their lives will be like as data scientists. “*If you're coming from academic
    background, remember that companies are not looking for this scholar person who
    knows everything and can talk about the philosophy of it. The company that is
    interviewing you has problems and there is a reason that they are interviewing
    you. Most probably they want you to help them with that specific problem. If you
    can figure that out and convince them that you are going there to help them to
    solve that problem you have that job. So be confident, figure out what the problem
    is, and tell them how you're going to solve it for them,*” said Amir Hajian. Lindsay
    Farber added “*you need to realize that you're not going to just wave a magic
    wand and solve everything with machine learning. 70% of the job is cleaning data
    and pre-processing. You also need to realize that you can have a huge impact doing
    just regular reporting basic statistics. You can take your company almost 80%
    of the way there and that you can then use hard core data science and build your
    own custom models to take that to the next level.*” In some sense, “*you're just
    a glorified SQL coder or business intelligence reporter most of the time. However,
    you got to be passionate about data and remember there are always ups and downs
    to any cycle, but if you are really passionate and excited about data then you
    will have a very interesting and fulfilling career,*” said Baiju Devani.

    other. One of the best ways to find your best next job opportunity or hire is
    to network with like-minded people. Keep an open mind, and be respectful of everyone,
    and try to help others as much as you can, and they will come back and help you
    when they can. It is very crucial to establish good professional relationships
    and maintain them. “*This might sound like a no-brainer to some of us but don't
    burn the bridges! For example, If you're going through an interview and if you
    realize it's not going the way that you were hoping don't get upset and defensive,
    rather ask them for their suggestions for things that you can improve,*” said
    Ozge Yeloglu. This is a small community of intellectuals that works hard to improve
    its collective wisdom and achieve great things, after all.
