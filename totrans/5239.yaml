    19th annual KDnuggets Software Poll had over 2,300 voters, somewhat less than
    in 2017, perhaps because only one vendor - RapidMiner - had a very active campaign
    to vote in KDnuggets poll. On average, a participant selected about 7 different
    tools used, so votes with just one tool selected stood out. We removed about 260
    such "lone" votes (which mainly were from RapidMiner), because even if they represented
    legitimate users of that tool, their experience was very atypical and would skew
    the results. To compare "apples" to "apples" I also removed such lone votes from
    2016 and 2017 data (about 11% in 2017 and 12% in 2016), so the 2017 percentage
    in this blog for most tools will be slightly higher than what was reported in
    2017 post.'

    a number of channels, including sending a few emails to people who have used our
    product in the past 12 months. We''ve done the same promotion before, but two
    different things happened this year. First we received a much better response.
    Over 400 users personally replied to my email expressing how happy they were to
    help us out. But more importantly, we''ve seen a 300% increase in monthly active
    RapidMiner users over the past year, so we emailed more people than in prior years.
    We''re humbled to have such an engaged and loyal user community."'
