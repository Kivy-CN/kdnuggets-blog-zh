    replace relational databases, and they aren’t trying to. But they will start to
    enter the spaces where datalakes and data warehouses are struggling. A graph database
    is faster and more intuitive to analyze networks of events, resources, and people:'

    to mimic the real-world networks in business.

- en: As you get started with graph databases and the query languages, it is important
    to prepare for a shift in your mental model. First off, there is not yet a widely
    accepted standard query language like SQL. As you can see in the attachment, there
    is a group of competing languages and a committee struggling to get everyone to
    agree on a single GQL standard. For our purposes today, we will use the Cypher
    query language, which is developed and promoted by the top database vendor, Neo4j.

    has been replaced by MATCH. FROM and JOIN have been discarded. But the WHERE and
    ORDER BY commands are used in the same way. Aggregate functions like SUM and AVG
    are all there, but the GROUP BY has been discarded. Most importantly, though,
    we gain the ability to query patterns in the graph using the node relationships. In
    the attached Cheat Sheet, you will see a list of most-commonly used query approaches.

    in their life! Obviously, this graph could be much more complex if we added the
    full list of properties for each node.

    source such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/startupsci/awesome-datasets-graph)
    or from a vendor, such as [JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org/) or [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/developer/example-data/).

    relationships, give a graph database a try. You will find that the data that fits
    awkwardly in a relational database will be right at home in a graph!
