- en: This has been one of the most intriguing questions in science fiction and philosophy
    since the advent of machines. With modern technology such questions are no longer
    bound to creative conjecture, machine learning is all around us. From deciding
    which movie you might want to watch next on Netflix to predicting stock market
    trends, machine learning has a profound impact on how data is understood in the
    modern era.

    learning techniques for your own projects and datasets. In just 20 minutes, you
    will learn how to use Python to apply different machine learning techniques, from
    decision trees to deep neural networks, to a sample dataset. This is practical,
    not a conceptual, introduction; to fully understand the capabilities of machine
    learning I highly recommend that you seek out resources that explain the low level
    implementations of these techniques.

    dataset that provides data on the passengers aboard the infamous doomed sea voyage
    of 1912\. By examining factors such as class, sex, and age, we will experiment
    with different machine learning algorithms and build a program that can predict
    whether a given passenger would have survived this disaster.'

    a few software packages if you do not have them yet.

    using the “pip” [Python package manager](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), which
    will allow you to simply run “pip3 install <packagename>” to install each of the

    overall chance of survival for a Titanic passenger.

- en: The calculation shows that only 38% of the passengers survived. Not the best
    odds. The reason for this massive loss of life is that the Titanic was only carrying
    20 lifeboats, which was not nearly enough for the 1,317 passengers and 885 crew
    members aboard. It seems unlikely that all of the passengers would have had equal
    chances at survival, so we will continue breaking down the data to examine the
    social dynamics that determined who got a place on a lifeboat and who did not.

    true on the Titanic where the luxurious 1st class areas were completely off limits
    to the middle-class passengers of 2nd class, and especially to those who carried
    a 3rd class “economy price” ticket. To get a view into the composition of each
    class, we can group data by class, and view the averages for each column:'

    passengers in 1st class had a 62% chance of survival, compared to a 25.5% chance
    for those in 3rd class. Additionally, the lower classes generally consisted of
    younger people, and the ticket prices for first class were predictably much higher
    than those for second and third class. The average ticket price for first class,
    £87.5, is equivalent to $13,487 in 2016.
