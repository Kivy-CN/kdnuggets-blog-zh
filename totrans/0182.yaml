- en: Previously, the Databricks team released **Dolly 1.0**, LLM, which exhibits
    ChatGPT-like instruction following ability and costs less than $30 to train. It
    was using the Stanford Alpaca team dataset, which was under a restricted license
    (Research only).

    model ([Pythia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373)) on a high-quality human-generated
    instruction in the following dataset, which was labeled by a Datbricks employee.
    Both model and dataset are available for commercial use.

- en: Dolly 1.0 was trained on a Stanford Alpaca dataset, which was created using
    OpenAI API. The dataset contains the output from ChatGPT and prevents anyone from
    using it to compete with OpenAI. In short, you cannot build a commercial chatbot
    or language application based on this dataset.

    issues, models like [Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html),
    [Koala](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2023/04/03/koala/), [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all),
    and [Vicuna](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/). To get around, we need to create new
    high-quality datasets that can be used for commercial use, and that is what the
    Databricks team has done with the databricks-dolly-15k dataset.

- en: The OpenAI research [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155.pdf) states that
    the original InstructGPT model was trained on 13,000 prompts and responses. By
    using this information, the Databricks team started to work on it, and it turns
    out that generating 13k questions and answers was a difficult task. They cannot
    use synthetic data or AI generative data, and they have to generate original answers
    to every question. This is where they have decided to use 5,000 employees of Databricks
    to create human-generated data.

- en: The dolly-v2-12b is not a state-of-the-art model. It underperforms dolly-v1-6b
    in some evaluation benchmarks. It might be due to the composition and size of
    the underlying fine-tuning datasets. The Dolly model family is under active development,
    so you might see an updated version with better performance in the future.

    and EleutherAI/pythia-6.9b.
