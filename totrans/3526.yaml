- en: This fun demo video shows how machine learning can be applied to video games.
    This is achieved using neural networks and genetic algorithms. What's really great
    about this video is how the author concisely describes how the neural network
    acts to achieve the given performance. Having played Super Mario World myself,
    I can say the gameplay is extremely impressive, learned or not!

- en: This is the first video in the great series of Stanford machine learning lectures
    given by Andrew Ng. This would make a good starting point for self-learning the
    essentials of machine learning. If the material in this video appeals to you,
    his [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) may also appeal to you.

- en: This Google Tech Talk by Geoffrey Hinton covers the next generation of neural
    networks. This acts as a good introduction to deep learning. It's a few years
    old, but still acts as a great technical introduction to the topic.

    machine learning in particular, Andrew Ng dives into applications of AI for robotics.
    If you're interested in these topics, give this video a watch.

    series, it is given by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa of Caltech. This series also
    has an [online course](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html), which also has
    a great companion textbook. This is another great way to learn the foundations
    of machine learning.

- en: This Google Tech Talk is also delivered by Geoffrey Hinton. This talk also goes
    in depth on the topic of neural networks. Where this talk differs is how it discusses
    the way this reacts with biological neurons and how that is represented in the
    algorithms.

- en: This demo video shows a system that uses machine learning to detect NHL goals
    based on the audio feed of the game. When a goal is detected, the system communicates
    with the hardware in the living room to create a light show. This is a great integration
    of learning into living spaces.

- en: This video demonstrates machine learning applications in video games as well.
    In this case, the applications are some what more "malicious". By observing many
    previous games of Hearthstone, an electronic trading card game, the system developed
    by the author learns to predict the hands of opponents. This is fascinating for
    anyone interested in competitive applications of machine learning.

- en: This Google Tech Talk, delivered by Andrew Ng, covers the use of feature learning
    to automatically learn features from unlabeled data. This is great way to save
    time over the conventional methods of feature selection. If you're interested
    in the theoretical basis of this method, this video provides a wonderful explanation.

- en: This panel, hosted by the Stanford Graduate School of Business, has many industry
    professionals discussing the impact of deep learning. This is interesting because
    it gives many viewpoints and different ways of understanding the same concept.
    This is a good video to watch to get a diversity of opinions.
