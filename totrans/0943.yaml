    become the most sought-after field. All the companies in today's world get a competitive
    advantage if they leverage data science in an effective way. This has led to an
    increase in the number of job openings in all the companies for data analysts
    and data scientists. To get a job in this field, it's a great idea to show–off
    your skills by building [data analytics projects](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/data-analytics-project-ideas-that-will-get-you-the-job/)
    to solve real-world problems. Before we start discussing the projects, let’s see
    why a Data Science project will help you in getting a job and why you should have
    an impressive data science project portfolio.

    understanding of what kind of problems are solved using data science and how to
    approach them. If you want to get into this field, you would need an understanding
    of the skills required to solve specific data science problems. Online courses
    and books can only take you to a certain level but if you really want to get into
    this field, you should know how data is being used to solve real-world problems.
    To understand this, working on projects is the only way to help you get all the
    skills required for entering into Data Science.

    begins with this step where you need to understand and define the problem clearly.
    This is one of the most important aspects of a data science project lifecycle.
    For example, if you want to invest your money in Tesla stock but you want to understand
    how retail investors are viewing the company, and what are the overall sentiments?
    Then you need to define this problem clearly. In this example, your problem statement
    would be: *“Understand how Tesla is being perceived by the retail investors?”*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have identified the problem, the next step is data collection. You
    would need to identify the data sources from which you would be able to solve
    the problem you have defined in the first step. You may need to acquire data from
    one source or multiple sources using API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the example discussed in the first point, let’s say you are planning to
    invest in Tesla stock but are trying to understand the overall sentiment of retail
    investors toward this company. To solve this problem, you need to gather the information
    that will have comments about this company by retail investors. You decide to
    go on Twitter and see how people are reacting to different announcements by these
    companies. You can go through individual tweets and understand the sentiment since
    there will be millions of tweets available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In such scenarios, you would need to get the data regarding tweets that talk
    about Tesla. To get the data, you will create a developer account on Twitter and
    use Python to extract the tweets using Twitter API. These will be the data collection
    steps required to solve any project. In most companies, there are dedicated Data
    Engineers who are responsible to gather data, but sometimes a Data Scientist would
    also need these skills to gather information using an API.

    data analysis is all about understanding the data, identifying the columns that
    are required, removing the columns that are redundant, missing value treatment,
    outlier detection, and identifying patterns in the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the Twitter example discussed above, you will have to clean the tweets, remove
    the redundant information and keep only relevant tweets that are required for
    the analysis, understand the volume of tweets over time to find seasonality, etc.
    This step is used to understand and explore the data and make changes to the data
    if that doesn’t suit your needs.

    analysis using the techniques of EDA, you will be starting with the model-building
    phase. When you define a problem, you will realize whether that problem can be
    solved using supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Based on
    what your problem requires, you will need to understand what model to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This phase takes a bit of time to understand which model will be relevant to
    your problem. There are many models available in the market that can be used to
    solve the same problem and thus, you will need to evaluate these models based
    on their accuracy. Evaluation is a time-consuming process since there is a lot
    of trial and error involved in this step. Once your model is built and performs
    good-enough, then you can start working on data visualization and storytelling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the Twitter example discussed above, you can train a machine learning model
    using a labeled dataset (Information about each tweet that is tagged as either
    positive/negative/neutral). Once the model is trained, you need to input a new
    tweet to test the performance of that model. Once you test multiple samples, you
    can check the number of false positives and false negatives to understand how
    the model is performing. You will need to try out other models to compare the
    accuracy of different classification algorithms.

    site users, leads, or customers will take particular actions. It is a statistical
    method that identifies the probability that a customer would do a certain action
    by taking into account all the independent as well as confounding factors that

    and determine the probability or likelihood that a lead might convert and become
    a paying customer. Or it can also be used to understand the likelihood of existing
    customers churning from the platform. Thus, propensity modeling can help the companies
    to allocate resources wisely and get better results thereby reducing costs. For
    example, instead of sending a marketing campaign to all 10K customers, a company
    can run propensity modeling to identify which customers are more likely to respond
    to emails and thereby send emails to only those specific customers which will
    result in time and resource savings. There is a good dataset on kaggle for [propensity
    modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/code/benpowis/customer-propensity-to-purchase/notebook)

    Processing (NLP). NLP is used to break down the text data into machine readable
    format, tokenize the text data, extract meaning out of the data and then identify
    insights. There are many applications of natural language processing; understanding
    the sentiments of your customers, building conversational agents or chatbots,
    building services like Alexa or Siri, building language translation engines and
    many more. Thus, it is a good idea to have projects related to natural language

    [Facebook/Meta uses Text analytics](https://dev.to/nate_at_stratascratch/how-faang-companies-are-leveraging-data-science-and-ai-kfc)
    heavily. Unlike Instagram which has the majority of data in the form of videos
    and photos, Facebook has mostly text data. They use this text data to automatically
    categorize posts into different categories and automatically remove the posts
    which are abusive. In fact, Facebook has developed an in-house tool called Deep
    Text which is used to analyze and extract the meaning of posts and thereby automatically
    identify abusive posts and remove them from the platform.

    built Alexa](https://dev.to/nate_at_stratascratch/how-faang-companies-are-leveraging-data-science-and-ai-kfc)
    which is a smart virtual assistant. Alexa responds to customer queries with accuracy
    because it uses heavy machine learning algorithms underneath to first translate
    speech to text, then identify the meaning of the text using NLP, then use machine
