    No Longer Overlook](/tag/overlook)" -- the modest quest of bringing formidable,
    lesser-known machine learning projects to a few additional sets of eyes -- this
    time for April 2017\. Previous lists have included both general purpose and specialized
    machine learning and deep learning libraries, along with auxiliary support, data
    cleaning, and automation tools.

- en: This time around we showcase 5 more machine learning-related projects which
    you may not yet heard of, including those from across a number of different ecosystems
    and programming languages. You may find that, even if you have no requirement
    for any of these particular tools, inspecting their broad implementation details
    or their specific code may help in generating some ideas of your own. Like the
    previous iteration, there is no formal criteria for inclusion beyond projects
    that have caught my eye over time spent online, and the projects have Github repositories.
    Yes, it's subjective, but there is no qualitative approach to this task that would
    make any sense.

    The other is more orthodox in nature (the [Functions API](http://scikit-plot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Quickstart.html#the-functions-api)),

    by Data Mining and Machine Learning Lab at Arizona State University. It is built
    upon one widely used machine learning package scikit-learn and two scientific
    computing packages Numpy and Scipy. scikit-feature contains around 40 popular
    feature selection algorithms, including traditional feature selection algorithms
    and some structural and streaming feature selection algorithms.

- en: Though all methods of feature selection share the common goal of identifying
    redundant and irrelevant features, there are numerous algorithms for approaching
    these related problems -- this is an active area of research. In that regard,
    scikit-feature is for both practical feature selection and feature selection algorithm
    research. The project has a [website hosted by ASU](http://featureselection.asu.edu/),
    where it was conceived (originally in MATLAB, but later ported to the Python ecosystem).
    A list of algorithms which are supported by scikit-feature can be found [here](http://featureselection.asu.edu/algorithms.php).

    libraries has sprung up around TensorFlow enabling common tasks to be accomplished
    quicker. Sonnet shares many similarities with some of these existing neural network
    libraries, but has some features specifically designed around our research requirements.
    The code release accompanying our Learning to learn paper included a preliminary
    version of Sonnet, and other forthcoming code releases will be built on top of
    the full library we are releasing today.
