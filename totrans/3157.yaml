    for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives
    another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This,
    simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time
    are not “aging” like persons, but “aging” in reverse. Every year that passes without
    extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some
    robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life!

    as a concept was first invented in the 1800’s by [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss)

    They used it to determine the orbital paths of planets and other bodies around

    so going by the Lindy Effect heuristic it will last another 200 years. So in fact
    I might be little conservative in saying that Regression will continue to be in
    use in year 2118.

    example, in marketing, the driving force behind [Market Mix Modeling](https://towardsdatascience.com/market-mix-modeling-mmm-101-3d094df976f9)
    is regression. It is still a popular technique and many FMCG companies believe
    the outputs from MMM. The same holds true for other domains too. If Regression
    was not useful in delivering the results, it would have gone the dodo way. It
    is still used by the Industry and Academia alike because ‘IT WORKS’.

    AI. It has already faced [AI Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter).
    The longevity of Neural Nets and its variants have been hampered by ‘AI Winter’
    in the 20th century. Such disruption is not a good sign for the longevity of technology
    or in this case algorithms.

    strength in last decade. And I as an eternal student, continue to be fascinated
    about the latest AI breakthroughs. So a safe bet could be that we could see Neural
    Nets and its variants to survive another 10–20 years, with the hope that ‘Singularity’
    fear expressed by Elon Musk does not cause another AI winter.
