- en: R is a powerful and versatile programming language used widely in data analytics
    and statistics. A key strength of this programming language is the robust ecosystem
    of packages that support it. These enhance the capabilities of base R and make
    it easier to perform various analytical tasks.

  id: totrans-11

- en: 1\. dplyr
  id: totrans-12
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
    collection of packages designed for effective data manipulation. It provides intuitive
    functions to make working with data easier. These include filter to select rows
    from a dataset that meet certain conditions, mutate to create new columns, arrange
    to sort data, and summarize to create summary statistics.'
  id: totrans-13

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key feature of dplyr is the pipe operator (%>%). This allows you to link multiple
    steps in your data analysis into a continuous flow. For example, you can start
    by filtering your dataset, then pipe the result of that into a mutate function
    to create new columns, then pipe that into arrange to sort the final result, all
    in a single line of code. Dplyr also works well with other packages discussed
    below like ggplot2 and tidyr, making it a key package for any time of data analysis
    project in R.

- en: 2\. ggplot2
  id: totrans-15
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[The ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is also part of the tidyverse
    collection. It allows you to make a wide variety of plots, including scatterplots,
    bar charts, and line graphs with minimal lines of code. Each plot is developed
    in layers where you first set up the axes, then overlay the points or lines you
    want to include, then add labels, legends, and other elements. This allows for
    the creation of very complex but highly customized visualizations.'
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A benefit of ggplot2 is that this layering method allows you to create unique
    visualizations. For example, you can start with a box and whisker plot, then overlay
    a scatterplot over the top. The ggplot2 package also integrates very well with
    other tidyverse packages, making it a reliable part of any workflow.

- en: 3\. tidyr
  id: totrans-18
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[The tidyr package](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) is again part of the tidyverse
    collection. Its purpose is for data cleaning and organization, essentially taking
    data from a messy, raw format into a tidy version. Key functions include gather
    to turn wide data into long format, spread to turn long data into wide format,
    and unite to combine multiple columns into one. While it is a simple package,
    it is indispensable when working with complex datasets or combining multiple data
    sources.'

  id: totrans-20
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Handing date and time variables can be notoriously tricky due to various formats
    and the intricacies of time zones. [The lubridate package](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)
    helps simplify these complexities by providing a set of functions custom built
    for working with date and time variables. The central feature are the date and
    time format functions, like ymd and mdy_hms, that automatically recognize common
    datetime formats and convert them into date objects that R can then directly manipulate.
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Functions like year or minute also allow you to extract specific components
    of a datetime object. You can use these to quickly create a new column that just
    contains the year of a variable, for example, or calculate the years elapsed between
    two dates. This package is critical for anyone working with events, time series
    data, or demographics data that contains date of birth.

  id: totrans-23
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[The shiny package](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) is a powerful
    framework for building interactive visualizations and web applications directly
    in R. You can create dynamic data dashboards and visualizations without any knowledge
    of web development languages, like HTML or JavaScript. An application built in
    shiny will include both the user interface section, which defines the visual layout
    and appearance, and the server section, which defines how data is processed and
    updated in response to user interactions.'
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shiny is driven by reactive programming, so the visualizations will automatically
    update when users interact with it. For example, you can create a scatterplot
    that filters data based on user inputs. Shiny integrates well with other R packages,
    like ggplot2 and dplyr, to strengthen the analysis and visualziations.

    ways to manipulate, visualize, and analyze data. Mastering these packages will
    significantly enhance your analysis capabilities and improve your productivity.
