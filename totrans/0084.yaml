- en: When it comes to using large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, getting
    an ideal prompt structure can be hard to come across. You need to take into consideration
    many different factors to create the ideal prompt, such as personas, guidelines
    that need to be followed, and the type of context in order to reach your goal.
    With the Synapse CoR system prompt, you no longer need to do this anymore.

    Synapse‚Äô, a conductor of expert agents. This means that ChatGPT will take the
    role of Professor Synapse and will try to get a better understanding of what you
    as the user are trying to achieve.
