    It enables the leaders to get to the bottom of what moves the needle and cuts
    the mark with the customers. Put simply, data is an asset to any organization
    when used effectively and smartly. Gone are the days when organizations were data-deprived
    and did not have enough awareness to leverage its power. Recent times have shown
    that a lot of organizations have moved beyond the data constraints and have it
    in abundance to start the analytics drill.

    issues organizations face in their digital transformation journey. They need data
    management systems in place that take birth from the marriage of IT and business
    teams.

    data is ingested, stored, organized, and maintained within an organization. Data
    management is conventionally owned by IT teams but **effective data management**
    is only possible through the cross-collaboration of IT teams with the business
    users in the loop. Business needs to provide the data requirements to the IT as
    they have better visibility of the end goal the organization is aiming to achieve.

- en: Let me elaborate on this a little more. Think of a case where a business analyst
    presents a report to the business leaders that focuses on solving a particular
    objective, say customer segmentation. Now, if the business needs to know some
    additional details that are not captured in the first draft of the analysis, they
    need to funnel down this request back to the analyst through the entire data cycle
    and wait for the updated results before they are in a position to take action.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As it must be evident by now, this leads to an uncalled delay in getting enough
    information on the table to empower all leaders and executives to trust the data
    and analysis and design the business strategy. Not only does such delay lead to
    lost business opportunity in terms of competitive edge, but the report along with
    the data also becomes stale by the time it is exhaustive as per the business needs.
  prefs: []

- en: Great, so we have understood the problem now. Let us shift gears to how we can
    fill this gap between the business needs and the analysis presented. Now, one
    issue is clear in the scenario explained above - the current situation where the
    data is mostly handled and used by the analysts aka the tech users. Well-managed
    data systems enable non-tech business users (data consumers in general) to simply
    pull out the analysis of their needs and take timely decisions.

    most ubiquitous **consumer of organizational data**. We need to give more emphasis
    on the words highlighted above - data science does not own the data, it is the
    consumer of the potentially (and wishfully!!!) well-managed and organized data.
  prefs: []

- en: Why potentially managed data - that's because more often than not, data is not
    present in its right form and shape. Echoing the voice and concerns of the data
    science community, data issues are what keep the data scientists on their toes
    most of the time.

    the data-first culture and promote data literacy to ensure that the key strategic
    asset to the business i.e.data is looked after well and used well, too.

- en: Well, that's not an easy question to answer. One can not wait for the data management
    teams to give a green signal for the data science team to start consuming the
    data into their machine learning pipeline. A pragmatic way would be to lay strong
    groundwork for robust and effectively managed data teams, keeping in mind that
    it is an iterative process. Yes, just like the iterative nature of the machine
    learning algorithms, the underlying data management is also a lifecycle approach.
    It continues to evolve as data science works in collaboration with the data management
    teams in improving and enhancing the best practices and guidelines.

    policies, practices, and data-access protocols with strong data-governance frameworks.

    aggressively looking to monetize the data in various ways including but not limited
    to understanding the end user better, improving operational efficiencies by understanding
    the internal processes, or by providing the better end-user experience. Hence,
    the focus on data and data governance frameworks has increased sharply over the
    last few years.

    All three teams need to have a strong channel for communication and feedback.
    Also, the teams’ receptiveness to iterate and improve the current data processes
    is the key accelerator of the organizations’ strong digital journey.

    restricted to any particular team or an individual. It is the shared responsibility
    of each employee of the organization to contribute and establish the data processes
    of the highest standards.
