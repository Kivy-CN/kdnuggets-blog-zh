    Statistics. I compiled these references based on my experience and opinion as
    to what a good introduction and next steps are in this process. This is not an
    academic curriculum or anything tremendously rigorous, but it is a comprehensive
    list that will surely get you embarked on the journey to revisiting/starting your
    statistics. Many of the references below were recommended to me in several workshops
    I’ve attended, and I want to share with those like me that want to be better at
    statistics and Machine Learning (ML).

- en: The first resource I can think of out there for beginners interested in Bayesian
    statistics and modeling is Richard McElreath’s [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).
    Here you’ll learn everything from applying Bayes’ rule in simple problems to complex
    multilevel/hierarchical models. Since this is not only a book but also a full
    course, you should definitely follow along your reading with the [video lectures
    on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI).
    I would encourage you to work through the code and exercises at the end of each
    chapter, as it is the best way to start getting hands-on expertise in this topic.
    Another great thing is that the book’s R package [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking)
    and all the example code has been translated into multiple programming languages,
    so you are free to choose the one of your preference to go through the reading.

    examples, Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill’s [Data Analysis Using Regression and
    Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/) is
    a fantastic book for those with more interest on Applied Statistics on a social
    science setting. An updated version of this book is called [Regression and Other
    Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) (Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill,
    Aki Vehtari), and it will be released later this year. If you’d like to work through
    another more advanced course on Bayesian Statistics, I suggest you visit [Aki
    Vehtari’s teaching page](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto). Although
    more challenging than McElreath’s class, it is worth checking it out. Again, the
    course material is available in R and Python.

    book, but you are also looking into ML. You may wonder, where should I go? What
    to do next? Challenge yourself to read Christopher Bishop’s [Pattern Recognition
    and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738).
    Bishop’s book presents all the well-known ML concepts from regression and classification
    to neural networks through a concealed Bayesian lens. It is fair to say that I’ve
    deeply strengthened my knowledge in both ML and Bayesian statistics just by working
    through the first chapters. Although I highly recommend it, keep in mind, this
    is an advanced book, and it takes some time to get your head around the concepts.

- en: At the same level as Bishop’s book, you can also find a rigorous and detailed
    explanation of Bayesian statistics and modeling on [David MacKay’s Information
    Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html).
    I was fortunate enough to use this book in college, and it still proves to be
    essential whenever I want to revisit some probability concepts, Bayesian statistics,
    and ML. The book’s webpage also provides software resources and examples for you
    to experiment and play around as you navigate the text.

- en: Whenever you feel comfortable enough with the basics to go deeper into the math
    and the theoretical concepts behind probabilistic modeling, probabilistic computation,
    and applied Bayesian statistics, I strongly encourage you to read *all* of [Michael
    Betancourt’s case studies](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/) in due order.
    This will be challenging to grasp at first, but as you go back over the content
    and dedicate the time to understand these concepts, the reward is huge.

    in industry, especially nowadays, against the huge amount of attention on ML and
    AI. For those that like podcasts to listen to stories about practitioners and
    people applying Bayesian statistics to their fields, I strongly advise that you
    check out Alexandre Andorra’s podcast Learning Bayesian Statistics. Alex does
    an amazing job of interviewing professionals from a wide variety of fields, with
    incredibly diverse backgrounds and experiences, hence introducing you to the vast
    universe of applications of Bayesian statistics.

    and resources listed above is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To fully explore
    probability spaces and distributions, you need efficient and reliable computational
    methods like MCMC and its advanced variants. Today, many programming languages
    are capable of implementing such an advanced estimation algorithm, but the most
    popular are 1) [Stan](https://mc-stan.org), which is built on C++, and has multiple
    interfaces to R ([rstanarm](http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/), [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/)),
    Python ([PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), Julia and others,
    and 2) [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io). If you are interested in learning the basics,
    you may visit their webpages to see examples with code.

    Statistics. This topic is not easy, and you should invest some time to see some
    progress. The references above are a great starting point, and I’ve noticed an
    important step forward in my learning path by trying to apply Bayesian methods
    to my work. For me, its fundamentals are more intuitive and transparent, and overall
    simpler to grasp (at least conceptually), but considerably harder to apply.
