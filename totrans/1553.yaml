    as a set of tasks with dependencies between them. That is your data science workflow
    should be a DAG.

    a DAG. In the end you just need to run TaskTrain() and it will automatically know
    which dependencies to run. For a full example see [https://github.com/d6t/d6tflow/blob/master/docs/example-ml.md](https://github.com/d6t/d6tflow/blob/master/docs/example-ml.md)

- en: Writing machine learning code as a linear series of functions likely creates
    many workflow problems. Because of the complex dependencies between different
    ML tasks it is better to write them as a DAG. [https://github.com/d6t/d6tflow](https://github.com/d6t/d6tflow) makes
    this very easy. Alternatively you can use [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi)
    and [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) but they are more optimized for ETL
    than data science.
