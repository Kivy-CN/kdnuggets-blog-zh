    So many potential data scientists are interested in knowing what it is that those
    on the other side keep themselves busy with all day, and so I thought that having
    a few connections provide their insight might be a useful endeavor.

    As data scientists we are expected to solve complex business problems and make
    sure that the models we develop provide value to the business. For this, it is
    crucial to understand what is important to the business and stay in constant contact
    with business units to avoid divergence between what we develop and what they

    in hand and a two hour commute (thank you, Los Angeles), I am (usually) excited
    to start learning and doing something productive. I use this time to catch up
    on my favorite podcasts (Masters of Scale, Recode Decode, or Data Skeptic), listen
    to YouTube videos on ML/DL, prep for my next teaching lesson, brainstorm new product
    ideas/approaches, or put on some good music to get me pumped for the day.

    the morning to get caught up on emails and Slack. The first thing I look for are
    any urgent requests from clients. If there isn’t anything on fire, I read the
    Business Insider updates that come in daily. These updates help me keep current
    on trends and new product features on the platforms with which we work. These
    updates are enormously helpful when it comes time to make high-impact decisions
    on campaign strategy.

    reporting needs, internal meetings, client meetings, refinement of existing models,
    building out new tools, and many more things I cannot fully list here. Each of
    these tasks play a key role for the business and for my personal development.
    Administrative tasks like sprint planning and hiring challenges and improves my
    time-management skills and ability to make quick decisions. Client meetings challenges
    and improves my communication skills and business acumen. Refining and building
    out new models challenges and improves my technical skills and creativity. As
    a data scientist, I find cross-functional roles that allow you to develop holistically
    to be the most exciting and rewarding.

    up by 6am at the latest. I’ve held this early morning schedule for close to 4
    years now and I love it! I make a cup of coffee, sit down, and check my phone
    (guilty of doing this first thing in the morning). After reviewing my emails/
    messages for work, as well as my personal messages, it’s time to start getting
    my older daughter (age 3) to her school. We pack her lunch together, pick out
    her outfit and then spend some time playing before I drop her off at 8am. The
    best part of my routine is that I work from home (it is super cool that my job
    provides this flexibility). If the weather is nice and the mood strikes, I go
    for a run (about 2-3 miles) before starting work.

    up my daughter from her school and bring her home (it’s walking distance and takes
    only a few minutes; but I love the energy that I come back with after this short
    walk). The rest of the afternoon is spent on work and thinking about how to automate

    classes at Dartmouth as a computer science major undergraduate; I thought the
    material was intriguing, exciting, and new. After realizing the potential of this
    field, I was certain this was what I wanted to get into. I also knew I wanted
    to work at a startup.
  prefs: []

- en: From there, I taught myself how to use some data science APIs properly through
    online resources. I had already developed a good mathematical and theoretical
    machine learning foundation from my classes at school, but still needed to learn
    many of the basics of data visualization and engineering, such as how to efficiently
    index Pandas Dataframes, create Sci-Kit learn pipelines, visualize data with Seaborn/MatPlotlib,
    clean data properly with lambda functions, and more. (Python libraries; R equivalents
    exist). I found [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) to be a great resource for
    this. Similarly, I thought the Sci-Kit Learn documentation was great resource
    for reinforcing my understanding of each algorithm, and how its hyper parameters
    affect each model.

    in New York City. Dataiku is a high growth international startup that makes a
    platform for Data Science; the company was founded in Paris and raised a 28 million
    series B this past September. From day one, I knew I’d made the right decision
    in both field and career path. Not only does Dataiku have a phenomenal company
    startup culture, but everyday I also get to work on something new and exciting.
    No day is the same here, which makes my job a lot of more fun.

    heavily integrated with most other departments of the company - from helping the
    sales/partnerships team with data science expertise throughout the sales process,
    to helping the marketing team create relevant and at times technical content for
    meetups, our blog, 3rd party events, and so on. When I am not working with other
    departments of our company, I typically am supporting our customers, or furthering
    my Dataiku platform skills by working on some of my own data science projects.

    to teach their data engineers, analysts, and scientists how to leverage Dataiku
    to enable collaboration between their teams, easily put data pipelines/ models
    into production, and teach them how to use many more of the features our platform
    offers. I typically need to do this two to three times a month while traveling
    all over the country and being exposed to different data science processes and
    teams. It’s very interesting to observe how different industries and companies
    are organized and what they are doing with their data.

    work with a lot of different firms on their data projects. I have been exposed
    to a wide range of data science toolbox stacks, use cases, teams, and organizational
    structures. I’ve worked on NLP projects, time series forecasting, database deduplication,
    visualization, deep learning, production pipelines, Spark pipelines, and much
    more with our customers. One of my favorite parts about working at Dataiku, is
    that I’m not confined to working within one industry, or using one tool stack;
    every week I’m working with different companies, learning new things, and helping
    them truly get the most out of their data with Dataiku. I’m lucky to be working
    at a startup like this, and I really look forward to seeing it continually improve
    and grow.

    reading the latest deep learning research papers. I am able to stay updated with
    news/ tools in AI and Data Science by browsing my LinkedIn feed; I actually like
    it more than any other social media platform Some great people to follow I recommend
    - Matthew Mayo, Florian Douetteau, Andriy Burkov, Rudy Agovic, Gregory Renard.
    I typically get up around 8AM and then take the subway to downtown Manhattan to
    work. I get home around 7PM. I try to work out as much as possible also, since
    I am an ex-D1 basketball athlete.
