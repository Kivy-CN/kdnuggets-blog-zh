    and wrote [the answers](/2016/02/21-data-science-interview-questions-answers.html).
    Here is part 2 of the answers, starting with a "bonus" question.

    reproduced by subsequent studies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We frequently see newspaper reports about studies that overturn the previous
    findings, like eggs are no longer bad for your health, or [saturated fat is not
    linked to heart disease](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/study-questions-fat-and-heart-disease-link/).
    The problem, in our opinion is that many researchers, especially in social sciences
    or medicine, too frequently commit the cardinal sin of Data Mining - **Overfitting
    the data.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The researchers test too many hypotheses without proper statistical control,
    until they happen to find something interesting and report it.  Not surprisingly,
    next time the effect, which was (at least partly) due to chance, will be much
    smaller or absent.

    Ioannidis in his landmark paper [*Why Most Published Research Findings Are False*](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020124)
    (PLoS Medicine, 2005). Ioannidis found that very often either the results were
    exaggerated or the findings could not be replicated. In his paper, he presented
    statistical evidence that indeed most claimed research findings are false.

- en: In most data mining / data science applications there are many more records
    (rows) than features (columns) - such data is sometimes called "tall" (or "long")
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some applications like genomics or bioinformatics you may have only a small
    number of records (patients), eg 100, but perhaps 20,000 observations for each
    patient. The standard methods that work for "tall" data will lead to overfitting
    the data, so special approaches are needed.
