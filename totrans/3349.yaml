    by basing future decisions from observed patterns in historical events can far
    outweigh anything that can be achieved by relying on gut-feel or being guided
    by anecdotal events.  There are numerous examples that demonstrate the possible
    lift that can be achieved across all possible industries, but a test we did recently
    in the retail sector showed that applying stable predictive models gave us a five-fold
    increase in the take-up of the product when compared against a random sample. 
    Let’s face it, there would not be so much focus on Predictive Analytics and in
    particular Machine Learning if it was not yielding impressive results.

- en: There have been a few epic fails where the test data has been included in the
    training data – giving the impression that the model is going to perform fantastically,
    but in reality results in a broken model. In the predictive analytics world, if
    the results are too good to be true, it is worth spending more time on your validations
    and even getting a second opinion to check over your work.

    or features that can be used to better explain the trends in the data. Too often
    data scientists will work with what has been provided and will not spend enough
    time considering more creative features from the underlying data that can strengthen
    the models in ways that an improved algorithm cannot achieve.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, out of 10,000 cases you have only two cases that are fraudulent
    and 9,998 cases that are not fraud. If the performance metric used in the model
    training was just straightforward accuracy, the model would attempt to maximize
    accuracy. So if it predicts all 10,000 cases to not be fraud, the model would
    have an accuracy of 99,98% which is seemingly amazing, but it does not serve any
    purpose in identifying fraud. It simply identifies 99,98% percent of the non-fraud
    instances correctly. So, for rare event modelling (of which fraud is a good example),
    alternative approaches need to be applied.

    regression is chosen as the preferred method, when in reality the relationship
    between the features are not linear. Using tree-based models or support vector
    machines work better in such cases. Not knowing which methods are applicable to
    which problems results in poor models and subsequent predictions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many practitioners are not aware of the redundancy of applying regularisation
    to the model’s features without first standardising the data so all the data is
    on the same scale. Regularisation would be biased, because it will penalise features
    that are on smaller scales more. For example, if there is a feature that is on
    a scale of 3,000 – 10,000, and another variable that is on the scale of 0 – 1,
    and another on the scale of -9,999 to 9,999.
