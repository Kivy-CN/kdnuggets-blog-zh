- en: Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe the behavior
    of random variables. In data science and machine learning, probability distributions
    are often used to describe the underlying distribution of a dataset, to make predictions
    about future events, and to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
    For example, the Gaussian distribution is a parametric distribution that depends
    on two variables, the ***mean*** and ***standard deviation.*** Hence, once the
    mean and standard deviation parameters are known, a dataset that is normally distributed
    can be created. As an example, the code below creates a dataset containing 1000
    values that are normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation
    of 0.1.

    because they provide a way to quantify and analyze uncertainty, which is an inherent
