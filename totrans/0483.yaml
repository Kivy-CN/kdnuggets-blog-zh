    of data is increasing **exponentially** year on year – driven by the digitization
    all around us, from interactions among people, and between people and machines.
    All these iterations are captured & digitized with billions of sensors, screens,
    and devices.

    discovery using a browser and search engine is no more. Now there is an expectation
    that data is instantly delivered to end user devices as information. No longer
    will search be conducted in an ocean of unprocessed data, a delivery of a clear
    stream of consumable information on end user devices is expected. Apps are **fantastic**
    at this.

    a rate five times greater than Global IT's capacity to deliver -an excess of 500
    million apps in four years. Professional Development in IT functions cannot cope.
    You can pivot to fill this gap, self-serve and remain relevant in the future.
    Citizen Development **t****ools** are available to fulfill app production and
    business process automation.

    Sitting back lets machines automate your current role and do it better. Pivot
