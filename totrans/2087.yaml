    the first concept of language models started with rule-based systems dubbed Natural
    Language Processing. These systems follow predefined rules that make decisions
    and infer conclusions based on text input. These systems rely on if-else statements
    processing keyword information and generating predetermined outputs. Think of
    a decision tree where output is a predetermined response if the input contains
    X, Y, Z, or none. For example: If the input includes keywords "mother," output
    "How is your mother?" Else, output, "Can you elaborate on that?"'

    first introduced in 1943 inspired by neurons in human brain function, by mathematician
    Warren McCulloch. Neural networks even pre-date the term “artificial intelligence”
    by roughly 12 years. The network of neurons in each layer is organized in a specific
    manner, where each node holds a weight that determines its importance in the network.
    Ultimately, neural networks opened closed doors creating the foundation on which
    AI will forever be built.

    the same way humans can. To improve computer comprehension for semantic analysis,
    a word embedding technique must first be applied which allows models to capture
    the relationships between neighboring words leading to improved performance in
    various NLP tasks. However, there needs to be a method to store word embedding
    in memory.

    to focus on different parts of an input sequence when making predictions. Transformer
    models, introduced with the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" in 2017,
    leveraged the attention mechanism to process entire sequences simultaneously,
