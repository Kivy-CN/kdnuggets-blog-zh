    you’ll know that the field has evolved a lot since its Wild West phase in the
    early/mid 2010s. Back then, a couple of Jupyter notebooks with half-baked modeling
    projects could land you a job at a respectable company, but things have since
    changed in a big way.

- en: Today, as companies have finally come to understand the value that data science
    can bring, more and more emphasis is being placed on the implementation of data
    science in production systems. And as these implementations have required models
    that can perform on larger and larger datasets in real-time, an awful lot of data
    science problems have become engineering problems.

    in and managed data science teams at Amazon, League and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative
    (formerly Meta.com). Akshay works at the intersection of data science and data
    engineering, and walked us through the fine line between data analytics and data
    science, the future of the field, and his thoughts on best practices that aren’t
    getting enough love. Here were our key take-homes:'

    through your choice of tools. Why are you using S3 as your data warehouse? Why
    not redshift or BigQuery? Forcing yourself to understand the answers to these
    questions, and not accept tools as given is a great way to grow, and is mission-critical
    if you’re going to impress potential employers.

    Production systems aren’t static, and you or someone else will have to revisit
    most parts of the codebase sooner or later. That’s why learning how to use docstrings,
    using clear function and variable names, and understanding best practices around
    inline comments is so important.

    as well next week. That can be due to any number of factors: seasonality is one,
    but user behaviour can also just change on you. Akshay suggests that collecting
    user feedback on the fly is key to addressing this problem: if you notice that
    their feedback turns unexpectedly negative, build an alarm into your system that
    lets you know that something’s not right.'

    lost in a technical problem, but the mark of a great data scientist is the ability
    to stop and ask whether that problem is even worth solving. Do you really need
    a recommender system, or would a simple rule-based system work just as well? If
    you can’t access the exact training labels you would need for a supervised learning
    model, can you hack together a decent proxy? The real world is messy, and often
    calls upon you to treat data science problems with more creativity than a Kaggle
    competition.

- en: The importance of seeing the big picture is only increasing over time, as more
    and more of the data scientist’s workload is being abstracted away through more
    and more powerful tools. Slowly but surely, data science is becoming a product
    role.
