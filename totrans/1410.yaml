  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Based on what we’ve learned from the early adopters of Dataset Search, we’ve
    added new features. You can now filter the results based on the types of dataset
    that you want (e.g., tables, images, text), or whether the dataset is available
    for free from the provider. If a dataset is about a geographic area, you can see
    the map. Plus, the product is now available on mobile and we’ve significantly
    improved the quality of dataset descriptions. One thing hasn''t changed however:
    anybody who publishes data can make their datasets discoverable in Dataset Search
    by using an open standard (schema.org) to [describe the properties of their dataset](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset)
    on their own web page.'

- en: Dataset Search also gives us a snapshot of the data out there on the Web. Here
    are a few highlights. The largest topics that the datasets cover are geosciences,
    biology, and agriculture. The majority of governments in the world publish their
    data and describe it with schema.org. The United States leads in the number of
    open government datasets available, with more than 2 million. And the most popular
    data formats? Tables–you can find more than 6 million of them on Dataset Search.
