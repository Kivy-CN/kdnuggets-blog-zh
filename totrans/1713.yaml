    first two acting as attributes). We hence construct a final data frame of vertices

    maps using R.As seen, this can come in helpful in cases where typical process
    discovery tools might not be available, but also provides hints on how typical
    process mining tasks can be enhanced by or more easily combined with other more
    data mining related tasks.We hope you enjoyed reading this article and hope that
    can’t wait to see what you’ll do with your event logs.
