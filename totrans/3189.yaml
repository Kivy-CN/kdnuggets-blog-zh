    was held last week in Long Beach, and by all accounts it lived up to the hype.
    While I was not in attendance (I wish I had been), third year Ph.D student [David
    Abel](https://cs.brown.edu/~dabel/), of Brown University, *was*, and he labouriously
    compiled and formatted a [fantastic 43-page set of notes](https://cs.brown.edu/~dabel/blog/posts/misc/nips_2017.pdf)
    which can only be described as inferiority complex-inducing. He has made them
    available to all in PDF form, and has encouraged their distribution.'

    he clearly managed to pack his schedule, and we get to live vicariously through
    his experience, if even after-the-fact.

- en: '**Ali Rahimi’s test of time talk.** This had lots of conversation buzzing throughout
    the conference. In the second half, he presented some thoughts on the current
    state of machine learning research, calling for more rigor in our methods. This
    was heavily discussed throughout the conference, (most) folks supporting Ali’s
    point (at least those I talked to), and a few others saying that his point isn’t
    grounded since some of the methods he seemed to be targeting(primarily deep learning)
    work so well in practice. My personal take is that he wasn’t necessarily calling
    for theory to back up our methods so much as rigor I take the call for rigor to
    be a poignant one. I think it’s uncontroversial to say that effective experimentation
    is a good thing for the ML community. What exactly that entails is of course up
    for debate (see next bullet).'

    that two approaches, let’s call them A and B, dominated one another on the exact
    same task depending on the random seed chosen. That is, A achieved statistically
    significant superior performance over B with one random seed, while this dominance
    was flipped with a different random seed. I really like this work, and again take
    it to be at just the right time. Particularly in Deep RL, where most results are
    of the form: “our algorithm did better on tasks X and Y”.'
