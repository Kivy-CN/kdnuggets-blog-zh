- en: Any AI model training and deployment goes through a long data journey. Some
    of these steps are standard and can be automated thereby enabling fast model development
    and deployment. PyCaret is one of the packages developed in pursuit of churning
    out machine-learning models at a factory scale. Let's get started with learning
    about it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PyCaret is an open-source, low-code data science package in Python that speeds
    up the experiment cycle by automating ML workflows. It replaces hundreds of lines
    of code with only a few lines, facilitating faster and more efficient experimentation.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a wrapper around multiple ML libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn,
    boosting libraries like LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost, spaCy, Hyperopt, Ray, etc,
    providing seamless and flexible development.

    and the lower status of the population. This means that the weaker the financial
    status of the population, the lower the disposable income, and thus the lower
