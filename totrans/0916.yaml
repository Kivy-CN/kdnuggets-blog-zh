    it is intuitive and easy to use. Furthermore, Pandas have much support from the
    community to enhance the packages.

    functions by Pandas were special and offered insight for your data analysis. What
    were these functions? Let’s explore it together.

- en: Boostrap plot is a plotting function from Pandas to estimate the statistical
    uncertainty by using the bootstrap function (Data sampling with replacement).
    It’s a quick plot to use when measuring the data statistic (mean, median, midrange)
    with interval estimation.
  prefs: []

    data number is on the size parameter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The spread estimation of the means is close to 30 to 40, and the Median is close
    to 12 to 15\. With this plot, we can try to estimate the actual population statistics.
    Your result could be different compared to mine as the sampling is randomized.

    all the available numerical data. Let’s try the function to learn about the scatter
    matrix.

- en: As you can see from the image above, the scatter matrix function automatically
    detects all the numerical columns from the data frame and create a scatter matrix
    for each combination. The function creates a histogram plot for the same column
    to measure the data distribution.

- en: Radviz plot is a plot to visualize N-dimension data into a 2D plot. Usually,
    data with more than 3 dimensions would be hard to visualize, but we can do it
    with Radviz Plot. Let’s try it with the data example.

    the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The result is shown in the image above. However, how could we interpret the
    plot above? For each variable, it would be evenly represented as a circle. Each
    data point in the variable would be plotted inside the circle according to its
    values. The highly correlated variable would be closer in the circle than the
    low correlated variables.

    identify clusters within the data. It also could be used to identify if there
    is any separation within the data. Let’s try it out with the data example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Andrew Curves work best when the data is normalized within 0 to 1, so we would
    preprocess the data before applying the function.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lag plot is a specific time-series data plot to check if the time-series data
    is correlated to themselves and random. A lag plot works by plotting the time
    data with their lag. For example, T1 data with lag 1 would be T1 plotted against
    T1+1 (or T2) data. Let’s try the functions to understand better.

    It means there is an autocorrelation with 1-day differences in data. Let’s see
    the data if there is a correlation when we use a monthly basis.
