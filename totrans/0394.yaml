    affected. This includes some of the most talented data scientists with which I
    have ever worked. Having shared my personal experience with some close friends
    to help them find a new job after being laid off, I thought it worth sharing publicly.
    After all, this touches more than me and my friends. Any data scientist who was
    laid off due to the pandemic or who is actively looking for a data science position
    can find something here to which they can relate, and which I hope will ultimately
    offer hope in your job search.

    in January 2019\. Three months before, the VP of Engineering of my then startup
    company had written a letter to our head of People Success. This letter explained
    why I was one of the top performers in the company and advocated for an increase
    in my salary. This helped me get a 33% increase in my salary. I was naturally
    feeling motivated and eager to crack the next milestone on an important project.
    The company’s future and my own looked bright. It was during this moment of success
    that I was told that I was impacted by the company-wise cost-cutting initiative.
    I was let go on January 15th.

    After browsing the data science job openings on the market, I soon realized my
    knowledge gap. What I was doing at the B2B startup (a mix of entry-level data
    engineering and machine learning) was simply irrelevant to many of the job requirements
    out there, such as product sense, SQL, stats, and more. I knew the basics but
    was unsure how to fill the gap towards more advanced skills. However, even that
    issue seemed secondary to more pressing questions, such as how do I even get an
    interview? I had a mere 1.5 years of work experience with a startup, and I lacked
    any statistics or computer science-related degree. More questions soon followed.
    What if I cannot find a job before I lose my visa status? What if the economy
    takes a downturn before I can find a new job? Despite my fears, there was little
    choice. I had to find a new job.

    to decide my next steps. After doing some research, I realized that more than
    half of the data science positions on the market were product-driven positions
    (‘product analytics’), and the rest were either modeling or data engineering oriented
    positions. I also noted that positions other than product analytics tended to
    have higher requirements. For example, most modeling positions required a PhD
    degree, and engineering positions required a computer science background. Clearly,
    the requirements for different tracks varied widely, so it followed that preparation
    for each would differ as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'With this knowledge in hand, I made an important decision: preparing for all
    tracks would be both overwhelming and most likely less effective. I would need
    to focus on one. I choose product analytics because, based on my background and
    experience, there was a higher chance that I could get interviews on this track.
    Of course, not everyone in data science has my exact background and experience,
    so below I have summarized the general requirements for three categories of data
    science positions at big companies. Understanding this basic breakdown saved me
    a lot of time, and I trust it will prove useful for others looking for a job in
    data science. I will add, however, that for small startups it’s possible that
    the interview will be less structured and require more of a mixture of all three.'

    a day to rest after submission. Because of this, I did my best to schedule the
    interview accordingly. There were no interviews the morning after my take-home
    assignment. Simply being aware of the basic structure can go a long way in making

    and typically obtaining offers for the last few companies with which they interview,
    I did not feel I could take this approach. When I graduated in 2017, I only received
    4 interviews out of 500 raw applications. I was not expecting to get many more

    No more. From previous interviews, I had learned that a deep understanding allows
    you to give more thorough answers during interviews. It especially helps to have
    a depth of knowledge in an interview situation when you tend to be more nervous
    and anxious than usual. That is not the time when you want to try faking things.

    in product or A/B testing, but I believed that those skills could be gained by
    reading, listening, thinking, and summarizing. After all, this is the same way
    we were taught things in school. Actually, as I get to know more senior data scientists
    I continue to learn that this method is common, even for people with years of
    experience. What you will be interviewed on may not be related to what you were
    doing at all, but you can gain the knowledge you need in ways other than job experience.'

    The next few subsections summarize the most useful resources (all freely available)
    I used when preparing for interviews. In general, [GlassDoor ](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm)was
    a good source to get a sense of company-specific problems. Once I saw those problems,
    I understood both what the company needed and where my gaps were in fulfilling
    those needs. I was then able to develop a plan to fill those gaps.

    such as “how to measure success?” or “how to validate the new feature by current
    users’ behaviors?”, I had utterly no idea how to approach such questions. At the
    time, they seemed far too abstract and open-ended.

    using the resources listed below. All this reading helped me build up my product
    knowledge. As a result, I came up with a structured way (my own ‘framework’) to
    answer any type of product questions. I then put my knowledge and framework to
    the test with that all essential to learning any skill: practice. I wrote out
    answers to questions involving product sense. I said my answers out loud (even
    recording myself with my phone), and used the recordings to finetune my answers.
    Soon I could not only fake it for an interview, I actually knew my stuff.'

    to improve the products and what metrics can be used to measure the success of
    those products. It’s also helpful to understand what data scientists do at each
    company by reading their blogs. Doing this kind of research leads to deeper and
    ultimately better conversations in interviews.'

    scripts!) which I followed religiously during my offer negotiation phase. Every
    single rule was so true. I negotiated with all companies that gave me an offer.
    The average increase for offers was 15%, and the highest offer was, in total value,
    increased by 25%. Negotiating works, so don’t be afraid to try it!

    and it is okay to admit that), I finally got 4 offers within 2 months of being
    laid off. 3 of those offers were from companies that I have never dreamed of joining:
    Twitter, Lyft, and Airbnb (where I ultimately joined) and another offer from a
    healthcare startup. By the end of two frenzied months, I had received a total
    of 10 interviews, 4 onsite interviews, and 4 job offers, giving me a 40% TPS-to-onsite
    rate and 100% onsite-to-offer rate.'

    being laid off, which was critical to landing a job at my dream company. It was
    difficult. Ironically looking for a job is also a lot of work, but everything
    was worth it.
