  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While GPT-4 remains closed and inaccessible, exciting open-source large language
    models are emerging as alternatives that anyone can use. Models like Anthropic's
    Claude2, Meta's LLaMA2, and MPT-30B show remarkable progress in conversational
    ability, reasoning, and multilingual versatility. Although not as massive in scale
    as GPT-4, these freely available models demonstrate that state-of-the-art language
    AI continues to advance rapidly. Their strengths in areas like math, coding, and
    logic make them capable replacements for many applications.
