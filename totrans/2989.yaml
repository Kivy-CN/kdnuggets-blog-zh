    resources and papers on subjects you’re interested in can be a hassle. Often you’re
    required to sign up to a website and some will even try to charge you a subscription
    fee for reading the work of others.

    This paper aims to combine the advantages of both methods of semantic segmentation:

    and is titled *[BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language
    Understanding](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/bert-pre-training-of-deep-bidirectional2)*.
    The paper introduces a new language representation model called BERT, which stands
    for **B**idirectional **E**ncoder **R**epresentations from **T**ransformers. Unlike
    recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional
    representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all
    layers.'

    Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/semi-supervised-knowledge-transfer-for-d2)*.
    This paper sets out to solve the problem that affects models using private data,
    in that a model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data
    and that subsequent careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive
    information. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates a generally applicable
    approach to providing security for sensitive data: Private Aggregation of Teacher
    Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models
    trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users.
    This paper also includes a link to the GitHub repo with all the code in TensorFlow
    for this project.'

    by Oleksii Kuchaiev and Boris Ginsburg. This paper suggests a novel model for
    the rating prediction task in recommender systems which significantly outperforms
    previous state-of-the art models on a time-split Netflix data set. The model is
    based on deep autoencoder with 6 layers and is trained end-to-end without any
    layer-wise pre-training. This is an NVIDIA research project in PyTorch with all
    the code used available for public use.
