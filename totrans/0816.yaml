    observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis was true. To put
    it simply, it is the probability to the right of the respective test statistic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of significance, alpha, by comparing this probability directly with alpha, and
    this is the final step of hypothesis testing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    an alpha of 5% means there is a 95% level of confidence. The null hypothesis is
    only kept when the p-value is less than or equal to alpha.
