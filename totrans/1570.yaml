    on what it is, and then why it matters for the data world. I’ll be explicit in
    the difference between philosophical ontology and the ontology related to information
    and data in computer science.

    there is another part to that definition that will help us in the following sections,
    and that is ontology is usually also taken to encompass problems about the most
    general features and** relations of the entities** which do exist.

    For some physicists in the 1900s there was simply no reality expressed in the
    quantum formalism. At the other extreme, there were many quantum physicists who
    took the diametrically opposite view: that the unitarily evolving quantum state
    completely describes actual reality, with the alarming implication that practically
    all quantum alternatives must always continue to coexist (in superposition). And
    thus opening the whole world to a new view and understanding of the “things” that
    “exists” in nature.'

- en: But let’s come back to the relation of entities part of the definition. Sometimes
    when we talk about entities and their relation, ontology is referred as **formal
    ontology. **These are theories that attempt to give precise mathematical formulations
    of the properties and relations of certain entities. Such theories usually propose
    axioms about these entities in question, spelled out in some formal language based
    on some system of formal logic.

- en: If we bring back the definition of formal ontology from above, and then we think
    of data and information, it’s possible to set up a framework to study data and
    its relation to other data. In this framework we represent information in an especially
    useful way. Information represented in a particular formal ontology can be more
    easily accessible to automated information processing, and how best to do this
    is an active area of research in computer science like data science. The use of
    the formal ontology here is **representational**. It is a framework to represent
    information, and as such it can be representationally successful whether or not
    the formal theory used in fact truly describes a domain of entities.

    huge numbers of links between different data.

    the way we can connect entities and understand their relationships. With ontology
    one can enable such a description, but first we need to formally specify components
    such as individuals (instances of objects), classes, attributes and relations
    as well as restrictions, rules and axioms.

    You had previously thought that the property was single-valued, but now it needs
    to be multi-valued. For almost all modern relational databases, this change would
    require you to delete the entire column for that property and then create an entirely
    new table that holds all of those property values plus a foreign key reference.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not only a lot of work, but it will also invalidate any indices that
    deal with the original table. It will also invalidate any related queries that
    your users have written. In short, making that one change can be very difficult
    and complicated. Often, such changes are so troublesome that they are simply never
    made.
