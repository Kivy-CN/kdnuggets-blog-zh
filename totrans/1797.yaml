    Everyone wants to jump right into the real meaty, highly technical data science
    books. But I recommend to my students to start with the book “Moneyball.” The
    book does a great job of making the power of data science come to life (and the
    movie doesn’t count, as my wife saw it and “Brad Pitt is so cute!” was her only
    takeaway... ugh). One of my favorite lessons out of the book is the definition
    of data science:'

    science definition. Business stakeholders must feel comfortable brainstorming
    different variables and metrics that *might* be better predictors of performance
    without feeling like their ideas will be judged. Some of our best ideas come from
    people whose voices typically don’t get heard. Our Big Data Vision Workshop process
    considers all ideas to be worthy of consideration. If you do not embrace that
    concept, then you risk constraining the creative thinking of the business stakeholders,
    or worse, miss out on surfacing potentially valuable data insight.'

    identify (and quantify) which variables and metrics **are** better predictors
    of performance. Let me walk through an example.

- en: We recently had an engagement with a financial services organization where we
    were asked to predict customer attritors; that is, to identify which customers
    were at-risk of ending their relationship with the organization. As we typically
    do in a Big Data Vision Workshop, we held facilitated brainstorming sessions with
    the business stakeholders to identify those variables and metrics that might be
    better predictors of performance (see Figure 1).

    an “Attrition Score” that can be used to identify (or score) at-risk customers.
    The data science team embraced the iterative, “fail fast / learn faster” process
    in testing different combinations of variables and metrics.   The data science
    team tested different data enrichment and transformation techniques and different
    analytic algorithms with different combinations of the variables and metrics to
    see which combinations of variables yielded the best results (see Figure 2).

    that “works.” The data science teams needs to constantly push the envelope and
    as a result, fail enough in their testing of different combinations of variables
    to feel personally confident in the results of the final model.

- en: After much testing and failing – and testing and failing – and testing and failing,
    the data science team came up with an “Attrition Score” model that *had failed
    enough times* for them to feel confident about its results (see Figure 3).

- en: The creative data science process of combining different variables and metrics
    is highly dependent upon the success of the business stakeholder brainstorming
    exercises. If the business stakeholders are not brought into this process early
    and allowed to think creatively about what variables and metrics ***might*** be
    better predictors of performance, then the collection of variables and metrics
    that the data science team will seek to test will be limited. Put another way,
    the success of the data science process and the creation of the actionable score
    is highly dependent upon the creative involvement of the business stakeholders
    at the beginning of the process.
