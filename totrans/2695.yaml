    recruiters from all over the world rely on LinkedIn to source and filter candidates
    for specific career opportunities. Specifically, [LinkedIn Recruiter](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruiter) is
    the product that helps recruiters build and manage a talent pool that optimizes
    the chances of a successful hire. The effectiveness of LinkedIn Recruiter is powered
    by an incredibly sophisticated series of search and recommendation algorithms
    that leverage state of the art machine learning architectures with the pragmatism
    of real world systems.

    been pushing the boundaries of machine learning research and development. In addition
    to nurturing one of the richest datasets in the world, LinkedIn has been constantly
    experimenting with cutting edge machine learning techniques in order to make artificial
    intelligence(AI) a first class citizen of the LinkedIn experience. The recommendation
    experience in their Recruiter product required all LinkedIn’s machine learning
    expertise as it turned out to be a very unique challenge. In addition to dealing
    with an incredibly large and constantly growing dataset, LinkedIn Recruiter needs
    to handle arbitrarily complex queries and filters and deliver results that are
    relevant to a specific criteria. Search environments are so dynamic that result
    really hard to model as machine learning problems. In the case of Recruiter, LinkedIn
    used a three-factor criterial to frame the objectives of the search and recommendation
    model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1) **Relevance:** The search results need to not only return relevant candidates
    but to surface candidates that could be interested on the target position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2) **Query Intelligence:** Search results should not only return candidates
    that match a specific criteria but also similar criteria’s. For instance a search
    for machine learning should return candidates that list data science in their
    skillsets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3) **Personalization:** Very often, finding the ideal candidates for a company
    is based on matching attributes that fall outside the search criteria. Other times,
    recruiters are not certain of what criteria to use. Personalizing search results
    is a key element of any successful search and recommendation experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A fourth key criteria of the LinkedIn Recruiter search and recommendation experience
    that is not as visible as the previous three is its focus on simple metrics. To
    simplify the recommendation experience, LinkedIn modeled a series of key metrics
    that are tangible indicators of a successful recruitment. For instance, the number
    of accepted InMails seem to be a clear metric to judge the effectiveness of the
    search and recommendation processes. From that perspective, LinkedIn use those
    key metrics as the objective to maximize in its machine learning algorithms.

- en: The initial search and recommendation experience in LinkedIn Recruiter was based
    on linear regression models. While linear regression algorithms are easy to interpret
    and debug, they fall short to find non-linear correlations in large datasets such
    as LinkedIn’s. To improve that experience, LinkedIn decided to experience with [Gradient
    Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Gradient_tree_boosting) to
    combine different models in a more complex tree structure. Aside from a larger
    hypothesis space, GBDT has a few other advantages, like working well with feature
    collinearity, handling features with different ranges and missing feature values,
    etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GBDT by itself provided some tangible improvements over linear regression but
    also fails to address some key challenges of the search experience. In a famous
    example searches for dentists were returning candidates with software engineering
    titles as the search models were prioritizing job seeking candidates. To improve
    this, LinkedIn added a series of context-aware features based on a technique known
    as pairwise optimization. Essentially, this method extends GBDT with pairwise
    ranking objective, to compare candidates within the same context and evaluate
    which candidate better fits the current search context.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another challenge of the LinkedIn Recruiter experience is to match candidates
    with related titles such as “Data Scientist” and “Machine Learning Engineer”.
    This type of correlation is hard to achieve by just using GBDT. To address that
    LinkedIn introduced representation learning techniques based on network embedding
    semantic similarity features. In this model, search results will be complemented
    with candidates with similar titles based on the relevance of the query.

- en: Arguably, the most difficult challenge to address in the LinkedIn Recruiter
    experience was personalization. Conceptually, personalization can be divided in
    two main groups. Entity-level personalization focuses on incorporating preferences
    for the different entities in the recruiting process such as recruiters, contracts,
    companies, and candidates. To address this challenge, LinkedIn relied on a well-known
    statistical method called [Generalized Linear Mixed (GLMix) ](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0562-zhangA.pdf)which
    uses inference to improve the results of prediction problems. Specifically, LinkedIn
    Recruiter used an architecture that combines learning-to-rank features, tree interaction
    features, and GBDT model scores. Learning-to-rank features are used as input to
    a pre-trained GBDT model, which generates tree ensembles that are encoded into
    tree interaction features and a GBDT model score for each data point. Then, using
    the original learning-to-rank features and their nonlinear transformations in
    the form of tree interaction features and GBDT model scores, the GLMix model can
    deliver recruiter-level and contract-level personalization.

- en: The other type of personalization model required by the LinkedIn recruiter experience
    focuses more in the in-session experience. A shortcoming of utilizing offline-learned
    models is the fact that, as the recruiter examines the recommended candidates
    and provides feedback, that feedback is not taken into account during the current
    search session. To address this, LinkedIn Recruiter relied on a technique known
    as [Multi-Armed Bandit models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) to
    improve the recommendations across different groups of candidates. The architecture
    first separates the potential candidate space for the job into skill groups. Then,
    a multi-armed bandit model is utilized to understand which group is more desirable
    based on the recruiter’s current intent, and the ranking of candidates within
    each skill group is updated based on the feedback.

    on top of the Lucene search stack. The machine learning models described in the
    previous section contribute to build an index for different entities that are
    used as part of the search process.

    to multiple search index partitions. Each partition retrieves the matched documents
    and applies the machine learning model to retrieved candidates. Each partition
    ranks a subset of candidates, then the broker gathers the ranked candidates and
    returns them to the federator. The federator further ranks the retrieved candidates
    using additional ranking features and the results are delivered to the application.
