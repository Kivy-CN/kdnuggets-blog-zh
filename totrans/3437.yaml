    woman, being in 1st class, and being a child were all factors that could boost
    your chances of survival during this disaster.'

- en: Let’s say we wanted to write a program to predict whether a given passenger
    would survive the disaster. This could be done through an elaborate system of
    nested if-else statements with some sort of weighted scoring system, but such
    a program would be long, tedious to write, difficult to generalize, and would
    require extensive fine tuning.

    from the sample data in order to predict whether a given passenger would survive.'

    remove missing values and split it into training and test sets.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we perform a count of each column, we will see that much of the data on certain
    fields is missing. Most machine learning algorithms will have a difficult time
    handling missing values, so we will need to make sure that each row has a value
    for each column.

- en: Most of the rows are missing values for “boat” and “cabin”, so we will remove
    these columns from the data frame. A large number of rows are also missing the
    “home.dest” field; here we fill the missing values with “NA”. A significant number
    rows are also missing an age value. We have seen above that age could have a significant
    effect on survival chances, so we will have to drop all of rows that are missing
    an age value. When we run the count command again we can see that all remaining
    columns now contain the same number of values.

    algorithms will accept.

- en: The “sex” and “embarked” fields are both string values that correspond to categories(i.e
    “Male” and “Female”) so we will run each through a preprocessor. This preprocessor
    will convert these strings into integer keys, making it easier for the classification
    algorithms to find patterns. For instance, “Male” and “Female” will be converted
    to 0 and 1 respectively. The “name”, “ticket”, and “home.dest” columns consist
    of non-categorical string values, and as such are difficult to use in a classification
    algorithm, so we will drop them from the dataset.

- en: Next we separate the dataset into two arrays, “X” containing all of the values
    for each row besides “survived”, and “y” containing only the “survived” value
    for that row. The classification algorithms will compare the attribute values
    of “X” to the corresponding values of “y” in order to detect patterns in how different
    attributes values tend to affect the survival of a passenger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally we break the “X” and “y” array into two parts each - a training set
    and a testing set. We will feed the training set into the classification algorithm
    in order to form a trained model. Once the model is formed, we will use it to
    classify the testing set, allowing us to determine the accuracy of the model.
    Here we have have made a 20/80 split, such that 80% of the dataset will be used
    for training and 20% will be used for testing.
