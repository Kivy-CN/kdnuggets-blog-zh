    field. From generating text similar to a conversation with people to generating
    images from text, it’s all become possible now.

- en: That advancement also comes into the music generation field, signified by Google,
    which launched a music generation model called MusicLM. This model was released
    in January 2023, and people have been trying out their capabilities since then.
    So, what is MusicLM in detail, and how can you try it out? Let’s discuss them.

- en: MusicLM was first introduced in the paper by [Agostinelli et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11325.pdf),
    where the research group explained MusicLM as a model to generate high-fidelity
    music from textual description. The model is generally built on top of [AudioLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03143.pdf),
    and the experiments showed that the model could produce several minutes' worth
    of high-quality music at 24 kHz while still adhering to the text description.

    for anyone who wishes to develop a similar model or extend the research. The data
    is manually curated and hand-picked by professional musicians.

- en: Also, MusicLM has been developed following responsible model development practices
    for people who fear the potential misappropriation of creative content because
    of the music generation. By extending the work of [Carlini et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07646),
    the generated token by MusicLM is significantly different than the training data.

    has provided a simple [website](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/)
    for us to see how capable MusicLM is. For example, you can explore the generated
    audio samples from the text caption on the website.

    different styles of music can be integrated into one by using several text prompts.

    capturing the image's mood.

    accepted the registration to test the MusicLM since May 2023 in the [AI Test Kitchen](https://g.co/aitestkitchen).
    Go to the website and sign up with your Google account.

    The model can provide several minutes of high-quality music while following the
    text instruction. We can try out MusicLM by signing up for the [AI Test Kitchen](https://g.co/aitestkitchen).
    Although, we can visit the Google Research [website](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/)
    if we are only interested in the sample result.
