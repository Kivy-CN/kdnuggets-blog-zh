    we selected the tools with at least 400 votes. There were 11 such tools, and this
    selection also makes sense because there was a big gap between n. 11 (Apache Spark,
    with 442 votes) and n. 12 (Java, 309 votes).

    binary features, like chi-square or T-test, but we used the same Lift measure
    as in our [2016 analysis](/2016/06/big-data-science-deep-learning-software-associations.html)
    and [2017 analysis](/2017/06/ecosystem-data-science-machine-learning-software.html).

    with Tensorflow and Keras, until we arrived to the figure 1 below. To reduce clutter,
    we also filtered it to show only associations with abs(Lift1) > 15%.

- en: I don't think so, because R is an excellent platform with tremendous depth and
    breadth, which is widely used for data analysis and visualization, and it still
    has about 50% share. I expect R to be used by many data scientists for a long
    time, but going forward, I expect more development and energy around Python ecosystem.

    2018 Software Poll, exactly the same fraction as in 2017. This suggests that most
