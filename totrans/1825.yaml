- en: The recent explosion of interest in data science, data mining, and related disciplines
    has been mirrored by an explosion in book titles on these same topics. One of
    the best ways to decide which books could be useful for your career is to look
    at which books others are reading. This post details the 10 most popular titles
    in Amazon's [Data Mining Books](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books-Data-Mining/zgbs/books/3654/ref=zg_bs_nav_b_3_549646)
    category as of Nov 10, 2016, skipping over repeated titles as well as titles which
    have been obviously miscategorized and are of no use to our readers.

    framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather
    than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics.
    It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining
    in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning
    (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks,
    support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive
    treatment of this topic in any book.
