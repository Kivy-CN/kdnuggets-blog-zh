    of manually annotating data have become too time-consuming and inefficient. Of
    course, this is largely due to the amount of data companies are tasked to process.
    Today, we require more reliable and effective techniques. Artificial Intelligence
    and machine learning can provide us with these tools. This guide will explore
    how we can use machine learning to label data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data labeling describes the process of tagging and annotating data. This data
    can be in media files such as images, videos, or audio. Alternatively, it can
    consist of text or text files. Data labels often provide informative and contextual
    descriptions of data. For instance, the purpose of the data, its contents, when
    it was created, and by whom.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This labeled data is commonly used to train [machine learning](https://dataconomy.com/2021/05/machine-learning-vs-artificial-intelligence-future-data-science/)
    models in data science. For instance, tagged audio data files can be used in deep
    learning for automatic speech recognition. In a business context, labeled marketing
    data can be used with machine and deep learning models to produce more effective
    [sales productivity tools](https://www.dooly.ai/blog/sales-productivity-tools/)

    human labelers may be asked to describe the contents of an image file. Depending
    on the complexity and purpose of the machine learning model involved, responses
    for labels can range from being highly detailed to binary – consisting of an on/off
    or yes/no answer.

    models is known as model training. Even established machine learning models can

    Some NLP companies acquire user app data for their final datasets (recorded when

    has to be annotated and sorted in some cases. Often, this is initially done by
    human operators.'

    At first, human labels will be tasked to label and categorize certain sounds and
    noises. If the audio in question is made up of speech, labels may be required
    to transcribe it.'

    for training. This process is extremely time-consuming and expensive – especially
    when done manually. Once the data is prepared, it can ultimately be marked and
    annotated by human labelers. This process can also be costly and cumbersome, adding
    to final overheads.

    and accuracy are key. Data labeling can be tedious and repetitive. This unfortunate
    fact can make it easier for data labelers to lose interest and make mistakes.

    burnout, these can’t guarantee error-free labeled data. You still have to contend
    with human biases and mistakes. Furthermore, applying strategies such as auditing
    may assist in ensuring the validity of data labels, which is time-consuming too.

    learning to get around some of these downsides and disadvantages. For instance,
    we don’t have to completely replace internal human labeling with a machine learning
    or AI solution. We can implement a machine learning model to help sort and prepare
    the data. We can train a machine learning model to separate high-quality data
    from excess data. Furthermore, we could implement another machine learning model
    to validate and audit data labels after data preparation.

    data. This method can be done with statically coded algorithms or a machine learning
    model. Nevertheless, the latter is the most efficient – especially for larger
    projects. It involves first training the machine learning model with already established
    datasets and labels from humans. Once it is tested and reaches competency, it
    can label new raw data. Synthetic labeling using machine learning eliminates the
    need for human labelers.

    doesn’t have to build the machine learning model in-house. You can modify and
    use an [open-source machine learning library](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/top-open-source-machine-learning-libraries/)
    or project. A litany of established models probably already caters to your data
    labeling needs. Some crowdsourcing platforms already use machine learning to help
    identify the best candidates for projects. Or, you can use software like Datasaur
    to automate the labeling process.

    that they can no longer rely solely on human interaction to achieve this. This
    fact doesn’t imply that human labelers are obsolete, but as the nature of data
    and its processing continues to change, how we sort and annotate it must change
    too.
