    automated? This billion dollar question is greatly interesting and greatly unsurprising
    at the same moment. The immense scope of advancement possible through automation
    of data science activities such as data model selection, optimization, inference,
    etc. has led to great interest in this idea. Meanwhile, the fact that we live
    in Big Data era implies that there is no way the manual approach to Data Science
    can keep pace with the rapid increase in volume, velocity and variety of data.
    So, automation is inevitable for sustainable progress. However, how soon we will
    reach there is still debatable.'

    a variety of machine learning models and selecting the best combination of model
    and predictor variables is extremely time consuming and not remotely as interesting
    as it might sound in theory. If the underlying data was perfect, we could have
    been able to decide the best model from theory itself. But, in real life, data
    comes along with a lot of imperfections - errors, missing values, different scales/units,
    etc. With such varying data characteristics, one needs a lot of experimentation
    to determine which Machine Learning (ML) model would represent it the best. Today,
    we have a considerable number of ML models, each having a lot of inherent minor
    variations which are better suited to particular situations. Selecting a model
    goes hand-in-hand with selecting predictor variables, which is no less daunting
    considering the highly multi-dimensional nature of the data we are dealing with.
    So, choosing the right model is the same as looking for a needle in haystack.

    just how many man-hours are required but also the mandatory skills required for
    the task. So, essentially there are two solutions (assuming that automation is
    yet not feasible): recruit more people with the mandatory skills (i.e. data scientists)
    or through use of innovative technology eradicate the need for those specialized
    skills, thus, enabling almost everyone in the organization to understand and perform
    those Data Science tasks. The latter is the focus of the [Automatic Statistician](http://www.automaticstatistician.com/)
    project led by [Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) at
    the University of Cambridge.'

    learning required in the areas of automated inference, model construction & comparison,
    and data visualization & interpretation. For any input dataset, the Automatic
    Statistician refers to an open-ended language of models to search (greedy approach)
    and evaluate the models that are potential candidates for selection. The selected
    model and other data inferences are then explained in a 10-15 page report that
    can be understood by non-experts.

    of its report which is targeted at non-experts. The conversion of insights from
    statistical representation to human-interpretable form plays a crucial role in
    widespread understanding and application of Analytics. Here is an excerpt from

    criticism answers key questions (for example, does the data match the assumptions
    of the model?) and includes the results of posterior predictive checks, dependence
    tests and residual tests.

    expertise in devising appropriate features and models. The second problem is that
    the output of current methods, while accurate, is often hard to understand, which
    makes it hard to trust. The “automatic statistician” project from Cambridge aims
    to address both problems, by using Bayesian model selection strategies to automatically
    choose good models/ features, and to interpret the resulting fit in easy-to-understand
    ways, in terms of human readable, automatically generated reports.

    challenges such as reducing the computational complexity of searching through
    a large space of models and increasing the expressivity of language to describe
    sophisticated statistical inferences.

    such as [Skytree](http://www.skytree.net/company/pr/skytree-automates-data-science-new-enterprise-class-machine-learning-platform/)
    and [BigML](https://bigml.com/) have made significant strides in this direction.
    There are also a few startups such as [Narrative Science](http://www.narrativescience.com/)
    offering services to turn numerical analytics results into readable reports.

    is keenly desired. ![data-cleaning](../Images/635956536cf928f0cc746cb6d8430ff0.png)In
    fact, for underlying data to reach this stage, it needs to first go through data
    cleaning (also known as “data wrangling”, “data munging” or “data janitor work”).
    [KDnuggets poll](/polls/2003/data_preparation.htm) suggested that data cleaning
    and preparation take up more than 60% of time on data mining projects. The goal
    of automatic data preparation is being chased by several startups including [Paxata](http://www.paxata.com/)
    and [Trifacta](http://www.trifacta.com/).

    to perform data science tasks, automation also offers the key benefit of performing
    these crucial tasks with speed, scale and accuracy. This is a core requirement
    for sustainable analytics.

    and their job prospects? It depends. If you are a data scientist who treats his/her
    work as a typical 8am – 5pm job with well-defined tasks that need to be performed
    repetitively, you must be scared of automation. On the other hand, if you are
    a data scientist who loves his/her job, but is bored of non-challenging, repetitive
    tasks, you would certainly embrace automation.
