    point: Of all the ingredients that are key to success with machine learning, the
    one that’s most often missing isn’t about technology or data. It’s about leadership.
    Many business leaders do know that machine learning can''t succeed in optimizing
    operations without a proven management process guiding the project – but data
    scientists tend to focus on one thing and one thing only: hands-on practice with
    analytics.'

- en: Now, it's true that you learn best from doing – *but the number crunching is
    only half of what needs to get done*. There's also a business-side leadership
    process critical to machine learning's value-driven deployment, and data scientists
    must ramp up on it just as well as business leaders. Whether you'll participate
    on the business or tech side of a machine learning project, the business-side
    skills of ML are essential, pertinent know-how. They're needed in order to ensure
    the core technology works within – and successfully produces value for – business
    operations.

    – End-to-End Mastery](http://www.machinelearning.courses), addresses this need.
    First, allow me to tell you about the overall course: It will guide you and your
    team to lead or participate in the end-to-end implementation of machine learning.
    It''s an expansive curriculum that''s accessible to business-level learners and
    yet vital to techies as well. It covers both the state-of-the-art techniques and
    the business-side best practices.'

    "Machine Learning Leadership and Practice – End-to-End Mastery" prepares you to
    avoid the most common management mistake that derails machine learning projects:
    jumping straight into the number-crunching before establishing and planning for
    a path to operational deployment.'

    of machine learning – for marketing, financial services, fraud detection and more.
    We'll illustrate the value delivered for these domains by way of case studies
    and detailed examples. And we'll precisely measure the performance of the predictive
    models themselves, focusing on model lift, a predictive multiplier that tells
    you the improvement achieved by a model.
