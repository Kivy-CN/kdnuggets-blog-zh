    ways to approach and achieve the same task. These snippets shed light on one such
    approach for a given situation; you might find them useful, or find that you have
    come across another approach that makes more sense to you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with concatenating multiple text files. Should you have a number
    of text files in a single directory you need concatenated into a single file,
    this Python code will do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First we get a list of all the txt files in the path; then we read in each file
    and write out its contents to the new output file; finally, we read the new file
    back in and print its contents to screen to verify.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Staying with the theme of file concatenation, this time let's tackle concatenating
    a number of comma separated value files into a single Pandas dataframe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We first get a list of the CSV files in our path; then, for each file in the
    path, we read the contents into its own dataframe; afterwards, we combine all
    dataframes into a single frame; finally, we print out the results to inspect.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's say you are working with a Pandas dataframe, such as the resulting frame
    in the above snippet, and want to compress the frame directly to file for storage.
    This snippet will do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First we will create a dataframe to use with our example; then we will compress
    and save the dataframe directly to file; finally, we will read the frame back
    into a new frame directly from compressed file and print out for verificaiton.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps you have a situation where you are working with a list of lists, that
    is, a list in which all of its elements are also lists. This snippet will take
    this list of embedded lists and flatten it out to one linear list.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First we will create a list of lists to use in our example; then we will use
    list comprehensions to flatten the list in a Pythonic manner; finally, we print
    the resulting list to screen for verification.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This snippet will entertain the idea of sorting tuples based on specified element.
    Tuples are an often overlooked Python data structure, and are a great way to store
    related pieces of data without using a more complex structure type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this example, we will first create a list of tuples of size 2, and fill them
    with numeric data; next we will sort the pairs, separately by both first and second
    elements, printing the results of both sorting processes to inspect the results;
    finally, we will extend this sorting to mixed alphanumeric data elements.
