    AI has a great potential to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by
    2030\. The world is already seeing widespread adoption of AI in commercial use
    ever since digital acceleration induced by pandemic. IBM leaders project a 90%
    increase in adoption rate within the next 18-24 months. And it totally resonates

    lot of firms are sitting on heaps of data and find themselves in a race against
    time to get the competitive edge. Everyone is working on building quick prototypes
    but is missing out on a foundation question – whether they really need AI to solve
    that problem, rather every problem. It looks and sounds fancy to sell your product
    as an AI-powered solution, but the reality is different.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A problem that requires examining data and finding patterns will find AI in
    its solution. Now that you have understood the problem in its entirety, start
    working on some potential solutions that best address your problem. Note that
    you will not hit a jackpot with the first few iterations – generally, these initial
    reiterations involve scratching the surface and exposing the weak points of your
    baseline model, and setting the motion.
  prefs: []

    as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you iterate your way through the different versions of the model in search
    of the best model, the documentation will reveal your “tangible efforts” across
    different experiments and their suitability for the problem. But what is not shown
    on the paper is your knowledge bank, it is getting richer with all the failures
    that eventually lead to the best model. This knowledge bank will distinguish your
    intuitiveness in identifying ML solvability as a data scientist.

- en: Next comes the biggest weapon that can win this AI war – the data. Is it available
    in the first place – if not then you will find yourself in soup. You will wander
    to get the closest publicly available data or simulate one for your business case.
    In either case, the model’s ability to solve the problem is just a proxy to the
    model built from actual data (which is not yet available to you, unfortunately).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If data is available, then the predictive power of the model depends on getting
    the right attributes carrying a good signal. And the buck does not stop here -
    the next concern is to evaluate how much data is needed to get the first model
    version out? Well, it depends on how complex a task ML needs to solve? If the
    features are easily segregating the different classes of the target variable (assuming
    classification ML), lesser data will also do the job like in ‘[Iris toy data’](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Always remember that ML can do only as good as the data supplied to it and learn
    from the statistical associations. Not only do you need to input good signal attributes
    but removing the features that add noise will also help the model to learn faster
    and better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have built many hypotheses and run many experiments, but how do you select
    the best model. In fact, what is the best model? A model with a good generalizability
    quotient on previously unseen data is what everyone adores. That defines how robust
    the model is. Running experiments is easy but finding a robust model isn’t. Create
    an evaluation dataset that best represents what your model will get to see and
    perform on when deployed in production. Run your best model on this unseen evaluation
    dataset to find if it is truly the best.

    dynamic. Let me explain with an example. Suppose you are building a stock price
    prediction model where stock prices change for various reasons – sentiment-driven,
    quarterly and annual releases, macroeconomic factors, news-based, foreign investments,
    near derivative expiry movements, FED announcement, and many more.

    a reasonable human can achieve that outcome. What I mean by reasonable is that
    an average human can pick the stock patterns and trade profits as compared to
    a seasonal stock market expert who has learned the nuances and intuitions by failing
    and learning many times. Exogenous environments, in general, are difficult to
    model and require extensive domain knowledge to build an ML model.

    evaluate whether it is overpriced or underpriced. One way to estimate the price
    is to correlate it with the area - the greater the area, the higher the price.
    It can give an approximate which might not be very accurate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, you look for the other factors like the number of rooms in a house or
    how old it is i.e., the year it was built to get a closer estimate. Similarly,
    you hunt other factors like - does this house have a school nearby and is surrounded
    by medical facilities to get better price prediction.

    factors that go into deciding the house price, the better your estimate became.
    But it becomes humanly difficult to perform such calculations with increasing
    factors. In such cases, ML has the advantage of mining data associations on a
    huge dataset as compared to human experts.

    problems. We also talked about how the problem-first and not the solution-first
    traits are important to understand whether ML will serve good use to the given
    problem. Later the article explains how and why the pattern is crucial to use
    ML, why ML is not exclusively useful for constantly changing environments, how
    ML is apt for increasing dimensions, and how to set up a mechanism to validate
    the model output.
