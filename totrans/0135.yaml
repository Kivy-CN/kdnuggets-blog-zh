    emerging trends are shaping the landscape, with the potential to greatly impact
    various industries and everyday life. One of the driving forces behind recent
    breakthroughs in AI is Deep Learning (DL), also referred to as artificial neural
    networks (ANNs). DL has shown remarkable advancements in areas such as natural
    language processing (NLP), computer vision, reinforcement learning, and generative
    adversarial networks (GANs).

    Researchers often draw insights from the complexity and functionality of the human
    brain to develop DL techniques and architectures. For example, convolutional neural
    networks (CNNs), activation functions, and artificial neurons in ANNs are all
    inspired by the structure and behavior of biological neurons in the human brain.

    another area that holds even greater promise for transforming our lives – quantum
    computing. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computing power
    and unlock unprecedented advancements in various fields, including AI. Its ability
    to perform complex calculations and process vast amounts of data simultaneously

    due to their complex architecture. These networks are a type of machine learning
    model that takes inspiration from the structure and functionality of the human
    brain. Comprising multiple interconnected layers of neurons, ANNs process and
    transform data as it flows through the network. The term "deep" refers to the
    network's depth, determined by the number of hidden layers in its architecture.
    Traditional ANNs typically have only a few hidden layers, making them relatively
    shallow. In contrast, deep learning models can possess dozens or even hundreds
    of hidden layers, making them significantly deeper. This increased depth empowers
    deep learning models to capture intricate patterns and hierarchical features within
    the data, leading to high performance in cutting-edge machine learning tasks.

    to learn the complex relationships between text and images from vast datasets.
    Such models find use in various fields, including computer graphics, art, advertising,
    fashion, entertainment, virtual reality, gaming experiences, data visualization,
    and storytelling.

    challenges and limitations. The primary obstacles lie in Computational Resources
    and Energy Efficiency. DL models often demand substantial computational resources,
    such as powerful GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or specialized hardware, to
    perform predictions efficiently. This reliance on extensive computing infrastructure
    can restrict access to deep learning for researchers or organizations lacking
    sufficient resources. Moreover, training and running DL models can be computationally
    intensive, consuming a considerable amount of energy. As models continue to grow
    in size each year, concerns about energy efficiency become increasingly relevant.

    and evolving perspective on how the human brain processes information and generates
    intelligent behavior. The Thousand Brains Theory proposes that the brain functions
    as a network of thousands of individual mini-brains, each responsible for processing
    sensory input and producing motor output simultaneously. According to this theory,
    the neocortex, the outer layer of the brain associated with higher-level cognitive
    functions, consists of numerous functionally independent columns that can be likened
    to mini-brains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The theory suggests that each column within the neocortex learns and models
    the sensory input it receives from the surrounding environment, making predictions
    about future sensory input. These predictions are then compared with the actual
    sensory input, and any disparities are used to update the internal models within
    the columns. This continuous process of prediction and comparison forms the foundation
    of how the neocortex processes information and generates intelligent behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to the Thousand Brains Theory, sensory input from various modalities,
    such as vision, hearing, and touch, is processed independently in separate columns.
    The outputs of these columns are subsequently combined to create a unified perception
    of the world. This remarkable ability allows the brain to integrate information
    from different sensory modalities and [form a coherent representation of the surrounding
    environment](https://www.numenta.com/resources/books/a-thousand-brains-by-jeff-hawkins/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key concept in the Thousand Brains Theory is "Sparse Representation." This
    notion highlights the idea that only a subset of neurons in the human brain is
    active or firing at any given time, while the remaining neurons remain relatively
    inactive or silent. Sparse coding allows for efficient processing and encoding
    of information in the brain by reducing redundant or unnecessary neural activity.
    An important benefit of sparse representation is its ability to enable selective
    updates in the brain. In this process, only the active neurons or neural pathways
    are updated or modified in response to new information or experiences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This selective updating mechanism allows the brain to adapt and learn efficiently
    by focusing its resources on the most relevant information or tasks, rather than
    updating all neurons simultaneously. Selective updating of neurons plays a vital
    role in neural plasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt
    through learning and experience. It enables the brain to refine its representations
    and connections based on ongoing cognitive and behavioral demands while conserving
    energy and computational resources.

    cutting-edge technologies that enable direct communication and interaction between
    the brain and external devices or systems, bypassing the need for traditional
    peripheral nervous system pathways. BCIs find applications in areas such as neuroprosthetics,
    neurorehabilitation, communication, control for individuals with disabilities,
    cognitive enhancement, and neuroscientific research. Moreover, BCIs have recently
