    experienced a higher level of job satisfaction than I would have thought possible.
    To celebrate my first half year in this engaging field, here are six lessons I’ve
    collected along the way.

  prefs:

    of remarkable ideas and state-of-the-art advancements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve been pleasantly surprised, though, by the amount of actionable advice I
    come across on the platform. For example, I might not have access to [16 TPUs
    and $7k to train BERT from scratch](https://syncedreview.com/2019/06/27/the-staggering-cost-of-training-sota-ai-models/),
    but the recommended hyperparameter settings from the Google Brain team are a great
    place to start fine-tuning ([check Appendix A.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hopefully, your favorite new package will have an enlightening read on arXiv
    to add color to its documentation. For example, I learned to deploy BERT using
    the supremely readable and abundantly useful [write-up on ktrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10703),
    a library that sits atop Keras and provides a streamlined machine learning interface
    for text, image, and graph applications.

    questions in the field, new approaches to old problems, underlying psychological
    insecurities common across the profession, etc.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    p-hacking, data scientists need to set limits on how they investigate their data
    for predictive features and on the number of tests they run to evaluate metrics.

    recommendation engines, discriminatory credit algorithms, and criminal justice
    systems that deepen the status quo. [I’ve written a bit about these social ills
    and how to avoid them with effective human-centered design](https://medium.com/atlas-research/model-selection-d190fb8bbdda).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to address these challenges and prevent future breaches in public trust. Check
    out [Google’s PAIR](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/), [Columbia’s
    FairTest](https://github.com/columbia/fairtest), and [IBM’s Explainability 360](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/08/ai-explainability-360/).
    Collaborations with social scientist researchers can yield fruitful results, such
    as this project on [algorithms to audit for discrimination](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/27/1912790117).

    such as how to give an effective presentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s crucial to study the social sciences to understand where human intuition
    about data inference is likely to fail. Humans are very good at drawing conclusions
    from data in certain situations. The ways our reasoning breaks down is highly
    systematic and predictable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much of what we understand about this aspect of human psychology is captured
    in Daniel Kahneman’s excellent *Thinking Fast and Slow*. This book should be required
    reading for anyone interested in decision sciences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One element of Kahneman’s research that’s likely to be immediately relevant
    to your work is his treatment of the anchoring effect, which “occurs when people
    consider a particular value for an unknown quantity.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When communicating results from modeling (i.e., numbers representing accuracy,
    precision, recall, f-1, etc.), data scientists need to take special care to manage
    expectations. It can be useful to provide a degree of hand-waviness on a scale
    of “we are still hacking away at this problem, and these metrics are likely to
    change” to “this is the final product, and this is about how we expect our ML
    solution to perform in the wild.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re presenting intermediate results, Kahneman would recommend providing
    a range of values for each metric, rather than specific digits. For example, “The
    f-1 score, which represents the harmonic mean of other metrics represented in
    this table (precision and recall), falls roughly between 80–85%. This indicates
    some room for improvement.” This “hand-wavy” communication strategy decreases
    the risk that the audience will *anchor* on the specific value you’re sharing,
    rather than gain a directionally correct message about the results.
