- en: Businesses generally run campaigns of 8-10 weeks duration with weekly e-mails
    sent to the reachable customer base. Since the customer’s purchase pattern depends
    on the nature of products in the product catalog, the time to the next purchase
    is usually a month or more, depending on the category. As a result, for most of
    the customers, the content being sent across the weekly campaigns is usually the
    same because the model recommendations do not change weekly based on the historical
    data. Therefore, stagnant recommendations over a period of 3 to 4 weeks may lead
    to a bad customer experience.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the flip side, based on the frequency of purchase, sending e-mails with similar
    content may also serve as a reminder in case the customer misses any of the previous
    e-mails. Hence, the strategy of sending repeat e-mail with the same recommendation
    may also lead to increased revenue.

    for marketing campaigns, such as offers at an SKU, Product, Category, etc., and

    options at a weekly level rather than at the monthly level, with recommendations
    from the ML model to improve the overall customer experience without sacrificing
    the ROI. We will also talk about the different stages in the campaign that are
    ideal for introducing such a strategy.

    where possible such that the model recommendations do not change and the campaign
    lift is not sacrificed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned before, since the recommendations from the ML model usually do
    not change frequently, the idea is to identify the categories outside the top
    3 or 4 recommended categories by the ML model, which the customer is most likely
    to purchase without sacrificing the ROI.

- en: Let us assume that there are 50 categories that have been earmarked for a campaign.
    These are the categories from which the client would like to send e-mails to their
    customers and inform them about the discounts available on the categories most
    relevant to their customers. We call this group of categories as the “***Choice
    Pool***.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The expectation from the Data Science Team is to identify the top 3 or 4 categories
    which the customer is most likely to purchase within the “***Choice Pool***.”
    While building a model, the model will stack rank all the categories within the
    choice pool from which we select the top 3 or 4 categories we will send in the
    e-mail.

    where we are dealing with campaigns of long duration where the customers get exposed

    same recommendations across multiple e-mails.'

    and would enable us to make more informed decisions.'

    an important role in variety-related decisions. The decision around variety becomes
    insignificant in cases with a very small choice pool as it leaves very few options
    to try out. A choice pool with 20 options seems like a good place to start. We
    can also think about it in terms of the percent of options that are left after
    one run, e.g., we have to recommend 4 choices of the 20 choices pool, which leaves
    us with 80% of choices in the pool after the first recommendation cycle for the

    Rule Mining. Association Rule Mining is a technique that identifies the strength
    of association between pairs of products purchased together and identifies patterns
    of co-occurrence. A co-occurrence is when two or more things take place together.
    Association rules do not extract an individual's preference, rather find relationships
    between sets of elements of every distinct transaction.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One rule-based approach to include variety could be to consider price as the
    foundation for categorizing the choices into groups. This kind of categorization
    enables us to provide recommendations to the customers from across the price band
    range.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could go ahead selecting the choices with the highest model probability of
    being bought from each of these price-based groups and provide variety in the
    form of the options that have not been presented to the respective customer yet.
    This way also provides a way to understand if providing variety in the form of
    different priced options gels well with the customer base.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another rule-based approach that can be followed is to use choice categories
    defined by the business as the basis for selecting choices and provide variety
    across different categories. Similar to the last strategy, we could present the
    highest model likelihood options from each of the choice categories that have
    not been presented to the respective customers yet.
