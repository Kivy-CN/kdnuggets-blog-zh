- en: More and more application workloads are moving to the different cloud platforms.
    This could be a move to a public, private or hybrid cloud (where the latter is
    a mixture of public and private). Big data and analytics application workloads
    are on the move too. It is important that the data science/engineering community
    has a good understanding of these clouds at a deeper level so as to make the best
    use of them for doing their analytics work more effectively.

    infrastructure shown below. The unit that provides the flexibility, elasticity,
    ease of management and scaling in any cloud is the virtual machine – essentially
    through the hardware independence and portability that virtual machines offer.

- en: Although non-virtualized servers may be supported in some clouds, it is very
    rare in our experience that a cloud deployment would use this native hardware
    approach – and it can become inefficient. No cloud service provider wants to be
    duty bound to acquire and provision new hardware servers when you want to expand
    your analytics processing cluster or other distributed application– that kind
    of setup can take some time! Virtualization is the answer here, through rapid
    provisioning of virtual machines for this purpose – given the hardware capacity
    to do so, of course. Multi-tenancy on the cloud is also achieved through virtualization.
    Two tenant workloads may live on common servers, but are separated from each other
    through their encapsulation in virtual machines.

    processing and analysis work on a bare metal or physical environment up to now.
    But with the recent rapid growth in cloud infrastructure, these folks need to
    understand the new virtualized infrastructure within their clouds, as it is now
    underlying and controlling their workloads. We will go through the main points
    of interest for the data scientist in this virtualization area and the benefits
    from using it here.

    today, with Python, Scala, R, Java or others as the programming environment that
    operate on them. We see a big growth in interest in deploying these platforms
    to all types of clouds over recent months. As one example, the Databricks company,
    a leader in the development of Spark, deploys the platform to the public cloud,
    first. The Spark technology is absolutely suitable for the private cloud too,
    as we will see in a later section.

    tools for deploying their distributions to public and private clouds. The pure
    play analytics/machine learning vendors, like H2O and Turi also deploy their software
    as a service on the cloud. We see many smaller software companies deploying their
    big data products or infrastructure from day one to some form of cloud, no longer
    just to bare metal.

- en: There was an early misconception that virtualization in this way would slow
    the big data analytics workload down. However, extensive testing has shown that
    quite the opposite is true. Performance is as good as bare metal for virtualized
    private cloud-based big data workloads that use the underlying virtualization
    layer in the right way. We will show some testing results here to prove that point.
    The result of all of this is that the pace of companies’ moving to cloud is now
    picking up.

    questions. Data scientists depend on their data engineers to integrate, load,
    cleanse, index and manage the data so it is suitably organized for their queries.
    These queries or jobs can range from questions about fraud detection, customer
    pattern analysis, product feature use, sentiment analysis, product quality or
    many other business areas.

- en: Data science teams are made up of people with a variety of skills, with analytics
    and statistical processing in general being very prevalent among them, along with
    data cleansing, data integration and SQL/programming ability as essential skills
    for data engineers.  Data scientists/engineers are often not involved in choosing
    or managing the infrastructure supporting their applications, though naturally
    they want to get the highest level of flexibility and the best performance from
    their applications.

- en: It is very advantageous to the organization if the data science/data engineering
    people can speak the language of the cloud infrastructure decision makers, so
    they can have a conversation about the best deployment choices. This can be as
    fundamental as how many virtual CPUs or how much memory a set of virtual machines
    should have, for optimal behavior of particular workloads –or about the architecture
    of the system as a whole.

- en: Data scientists often iterate several times on the solution to a data analytics
    question. They refine queries that give different answers to a question over time
    before they are happy with the results. They expand or contract the quantity of
    data used for queries and along with that, the processing framework that holds
    the data – such as a Spark cluster as one example. This is a dynamic environment,
    where the amount of compute power and storage needed to support the analysis is
    unpredictable. Demand on the infrastructure can fluctuate widely over the course
    of a single project’s lifetime. This variability means that the application infrastructure
    must be open to expansion and contraction at will, according to user needs.

    a lot of freedom of configuration by the end user community. One group may be
    using dashboards, another workbooks/notebooks, others SQL engines for querying
    data while others still will write programs in Python and Scala to process the
    data. The toolkit for the data scientist/data engineer is growing continually
    with new features appearing regularly.

    and high-performance data storage mechanism to support them.  Their demands on
    the infrastructure will vary, but when they need it, performance is at a premium.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data science teams also need their supporting infrastructure to be available
    on-demand – their time should not be wasted in waiting for that infrastructure
    to be provisioned. The scientist may use the infrastructure heavily for a period
    of time and then move off the initial project to some other activity.

    measures can be a significant task for the manager or the Chief Data Officer (CDO),
    who is in over all of these teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the key area in which virtualization and cloud can help these communities.
     When managers such as the CDO are concerned with keeping their data analytics
    teams operating at maximum efficiency, they don’t want the infrastructure getting
    in the way.  By carving up their total set of computing resources into pools that
    can be allocated to teams flexibly, they can avoid the single-use purpose to which
    many physical clusters were initially put and use cycles from elsewhere that happen
    to be available.

- en: In big data, one infrastructure does not fit all processing needs. At the Hadoop
    level, for example, older distributed platforms may be suitable for some batch-type
    workloads whereas Spark should be used for other more interactive requirements
    or for iterating over a dataset. This means that there will almost certainly be
    more than one distribution of the platform (e.g. the Spark version) or combinations
    of other products in use at any one time. We have found many versions and two
    or more distributions of this software in use at once at many of the enterprises
    that we interact with, for example. Virtualization provides the key to running
    all of these variants at once, with separation between them.

    platforms provide. It does so by separating each group/version/distribution/application
    from others, giving them their own sandbox or collection of virtual machines to
    work in and isolating the performance of one collection from another.
