- en: I would say, if you are enrolling yourself in masters or PhD programs in any
    area - you are brave. You are showing a courage to learn and grow. So, what goes
    wrong after this step? Once you start studying, you get lots of assignments, lots
    of things to self-learn and explore, do work on research topics etc. Students
    start worrying about completing assignments On TIME to get maximum score, completing
    assignments 100% to get maximum score, completing assignment ACCURATE for maximum
    score. Which in turn counts towards their GPA. So, they start ignoring the fact
    of learning things and run behind scoring and getting good GPA. I would like to
    tell you, if you are worrying about getting maximum grades and for that if you
    are asking somebody else’s work to complete your assignment, this is going to
    give you nothing more than score. The consequences of it you realize when you
    start looking for a job. If you are maintaining your GPA equal to or greater than
    3.0 [whatever standard, you have in your university], you are good to go. GPA
    doesn’t matter, what matters is how much knowledge you gained. GPA is just a number,
    if you are having minimum criteria required to be eligible for applying to any
    job in the market, you are doing good. And if you follow the learning and gaining
    knowledge you will definitely end up scoring good.

- en: So, don’t limit yourself in exploring things during your academic years. Treat
    yourself as a blank slate and explore that area as much as you can within your
    academics. This is your time to explore being new bee in the area. Don’t hesitate
    to audit the courses apart from your required semester credits. The best part
    of universities here is you can audit courses for free. For that sometimes you
    may need to approach to a particular professor to audit his/her class. You are
    gaining knowledge by auditing too. If you are not allowed to audit any class,
    I am sure you should be knowing someone else taking that class. So, approach and
    ask that friend about what’s going in that class, what are they learning. This
    way you will get to know what’s going on around. What skills are in demand in
    the market. What’s going on in other areas too. Once you start exploring, you
    will get to know more and more about it and start getting to know your areas of
    interest too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Talking specifically for data – take / audit maximum courses provided in your
    universities related to data analysis, data mining, machine learning, deep learning,
    data science, cognitive, data visualization, programming [ R, python, Scala etc.],
    big data, business intelligence, probability, statistics, and many more. Don’t
    just fall for completing credits, graduating and getting degree. You are enough
    grown up to figure out what works for you. Try to find time. Try to do your assignments
    your own. Don’t worry about getting score. If you want to really worry about something
    then worry about understanding concepts right, worry about utilizing your university
    time effectively, worry about helping yourself on time. So please, “Be an explorer!!”.

    work place gives you motivation to work harder as it might be your dream job to

    you to make friends, have social life, gives an opportunity to lead or organize
    some events. So, every facility you are getting has its own purpose. Its only
    your job to figure out the priority of each one of those. You are a student, and
    it’s your job to take right advantage of any facility that university provides

    you are getting in university. Read books on stats, probability, mathematics,
    machine learning etc. Take the prints of book pages you want to refer in future
    too or write notes for your reference. Use group study rooms to discuss and understand
    your data. Do presentations. Attend company seminars or presentations to see their
    case studies. Join data clubs, if it’s not there form one and organize events/meetings.
    Participate in competitions, it’s easy to form a group in university as you will
    find lots of people having common interest in your class. Take an advantage and
    be wise to utilize the facilities provided by University.

    connect with people participating in the event. Not required to connect with everyone

- en: Lots of employers visit the university campus to present their case studies,
    kind of work they are doing in their industry, it’s important to meet and greet
    them, ask questions if you find something interesting to your area, and discuss
    your thoughts on it.

    work culture of couple of employers, there too it’s important to show courage,
    present yourself with confidence and build relation.

- en: Apart from University activities there are other ways to do networking and connect
    with people. Like you can join technical meet ups in data [ there are lots of
    available in every area], show up there, interact with people, ask them what they
    are working on, and show what you can do contribute. There are couple meetups
    run specifically to collaborate and work on Kaggle competitions, it’s a great
    way to form group and work.
  prefs: []

- en: If, sometimes you don’t want to go for technical meetups, you can go for non-technical
    meets ups as well like gaming, hiking, movie clubs, Sunday brunches, those connections
    can turn into good and gives you more knowledge about area you are trying to build
    your career in.

    Robotics and AI, Other university events – like MIT, Harvard etc. If you are not
    able to purchase the ticket, advantage of being student is these conferences promote
    students and provide them discounts on tickets or you can join them to volunteer.
    That way you can again listen to and connect with lots of leaders and learn about
    their work in Data.

    seek always what you are looking for. It’s important to approach people and ask
    questions. Always keep in mind, no question is right or wrong, may be sometimes
    it can be easy one or hard one. But never hesitate to find answer by yourself
    or to ask someone. Never fall for finding any purpose talking to any person, you
    never know that contact can help you further in your career change. So, please
    “Seek, Network and Showcase”.

    or interest. Though the keywords sound very easy, it’s a very hard and continuous
    process. Most of the people have tendency to give up in between. I don’t think
    it’s their fault, but it’s an attitude or a human tendency, where everybody needs
    or seeks a success and a fame overnight. Bitter part is, it never happens so.
    Always we see success of a person but never see how long it took for that person
    to get that success or a fame. There might be some exceptions who became billionaire
    in early age, but life wasn’t easy for any one of them after that too, even though
    they achieved so much success, maintaining, digesting and further growing that
    success is an important factor.

    lots of job opportunities/openings in similar area, salaries are pretty fat too.
    No doubt, every individual wants to build their career into it. In result it’s
    competitive field. And considering the kind of  job application process we have,
    - it’s not effective, it’s almost outdated in turn people hardly get calls. Lots
    of profiles get filtered out with automated parsing system. So, students might
    find it challenging to get interview calls, but its important to be patient and
    persistent. You should not lose your interest and patience if you are really looking
    to get into any specific job role. Keep applying to jobs through online job boards.
    People with whom you are networking always handover your resume. Its important
    not to give up and if you don’t then definitely you will get what you want.

- en: I do remember, when I started my job search in Data science, my first concern
    was, why do they need PhD candidates? How come degree can be a filter to any job
    role? How experience doesn’t take priority over the degree? No doubt you are going
    to be in similar situation now or later. But one very good quality I have is,
    " I never give up ". I was persistently applying to jobs – all the platforms –
    LinkedIn, Glass door or Monster [whichever you feel or all]. And finally got into
    one opportunity.
  prefs: []

- en: If you are getting your masters or PhD in any specific area, it is required
    to work hard and get into same area of interest. There might be more challenges
    being an immigrant or being new in that field, but definitely these three qualities
    helps to overcome those challenges.  So, keep applying. It’s not good to compromise
    before putting on efforts to achieve it. Be persistent & patient. I am sure things
    will work out for you one day, the way it worked for me.

    additional which makes my profile stronger compare to other applicants, it could

    projects, but you might believe and showcase your own interesting projects apart
    from academics to show your skills and creativity. You might find lots of people
    going to technical meetups, but adding value to those meetups, showing knowledge
    and sharing it, also holding and organizing those might out-stand you from others.
    You might find people following lots of leaders to gain knowledge, but there will
    be only few who believes in sharing knowledge and enhancing skills. Only thing
    you need to find out which side you would like to prefer to out-stand yourself.

- en: I have seen lots of people changing their resume as per data job roles, does
    that really a need? The answer is may be for automatic parsing system sometimes
    it is a need, but trust me, if you are good in any specific field or area, those
    obstacles don’t affect much.  Being creative at making your resume, is another
    separate topic, I will not go much in details for this blog, but rather than that
    important factor is “Finding out your strengths and utilizing those to out-stand
    yourself in the job market”. Hope you are following ????. Remember "Everyone doesn't
    born as a SMART, but people definitely learn to be SMART".
