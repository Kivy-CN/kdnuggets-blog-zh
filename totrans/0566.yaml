- en: A couple of weeks ago, while taking my dog out for a walk, I stumbled upon my
    neighbor. Coming from a statistics background, she asked me about the different
    roles in the data world, trying to figure out her next career move. After I outlined
    the various responsibilities for each one of the job roles, I witnessed she was
    quite puzzled. "I had no idea this field is so fragmented", she said. And she’s
    not the only one.

- en: Data related positions are considered the hottest in the job market during the
    last couple of years. The demand keeps growing rapidly, and it’s not expected
    to change anytime soon. While everyone wants to join the party and enter this
    fascinating field, it is essential to first get an understanding of the various
    R&Rs (Roles and Responsibilities). In this quick guide, I’ll do my best to dispel
    the confusion by crystalizing the essence of the different positions.

    questions, then process and use data for enabling the organization to make more
    informed data-driven decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and organizing it to reach insights. Data analysts must possess both analytical
    and technical capabilities, and are expected to be familiar with ETL tools, data
    visualization and languages / technologies such as: R, Python, SQL, SAS, etc.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'While this role is not as technical as the other ones on the list, business
    analysts play an important role in the data world, as the link between the technical
    personas and the business side / management. They must have a deep understanding
    in their specific industry (e.g.: healthcare, insurance, finance) and the business
    processes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    they need to be able to produce reports, have decent data visualization skills
    and obviously be top-notch communicators.

- en: Data Engineers are the “builders” in the group. Some refer to them as the DevOps
    of the data sphere. I’ve seen different companies define this role quite differently**,**
    but in my view data engineers lay the groundwork that enables other roles, such
    as data scientists and data analysts to successfully do their jobs. In order to
    achieve that, the data engineers are trusted with the important responsibility
    of building and maintaining the big data eco-system for the organization, while
    making sure it’s robust and running smoothly.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Well, I initially wanted to leave this one to the end, since it’s obviously
    the most sought-after position out there - not only in the data world, but also
    generally in the tech community. Nevertheless, I do believe the collaboration
    between all the roles on this list significantly contributes to the success of
    an organization. That said, the reason I think it attracts so many professionals
    lies in the fact that data science, by definition, is the junction between three
    key areas: programming, statistics and business knowledge. It also involves a
    lot of creativity, since data scientists start from a business question and need
    to find the optimal path for answering it, using a variety of advanced techniques
    like predictive analysis. They are tuned towards conducting research for observations
    one wouldn’t have reached without deep analysis of data to the point of realizing
    patterns, linkages and behaviors of data, and then being able to realize how to
    utilize those to the benefit of the organization they are working for.'

    science.

- en: Machine learning engineers are in charge of bridging the gap between the data
    scientist and technology that would facilitate delivering the benefits of a data
    scientist’s outcome to production or to the service of the organization. They
    do so by building data pipelines, moving models to production, exposing APIs,
    training the models and performing A/B testing.

    up and maintaining the database. By being responsible for the health of the organization’s
    database, the DBA is basically in charge of one of the firm’s most valuable assets.
    The DBA’s activities include: manage access to the database (grant / revoke, etc),
    plan and archive backup routines (and recoveries), plan and execute installations

    data from a source database to a target database, including monitor and test the
    performance of the process and fix it when needed. In large-scale systems, this
    process occurs very frequently, therefore is crucial.

- en: I consider this role and the one that follows to function as the glue of the
    team. The data architect is basically the technical glue, leading all architectural
    activities. That includes creating blueprints and design documents for specifying
    database flows and integration points, evaluation and approval of proper tools
    for the engineers to deploy and use. The data architect should also act as a “gate
    keeper”, making sure the organization’s data vision is enforced, obviously with
    the needed security measures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    having in-depth knowledge when it comes to data technologies and best practices
    and keeping up-to-date with the latest advances.

    and overseeing the product portfolio in terms of leveraging data and alignment
    to the vision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First and foremost, a data product owner is, well, a product owner. In general,
    product owner defines the roadmap, collaborates with internal and external stakeholders
    to make sure it’s moving forward and function as the “glue of the project”. On
    top of all these activities, the data product owner is in charge of making sure
    the organization maximizes the value of data to achieve optimal business results.
    In some cases, this means influencing senior management by presenting the benefits
    of leveraging data, and also making sure it is widely enforced and embraced across
    the company.

    days, most companies out there already understand the power of data and its importance
    to the growth of the organization. Keep in mind that companies might vary in their
    definitions and scope of the different roles described above.

    role, there are many more roles that comprise the data world. Each with its specific
    challenges and required skills. If you want to land a job in the data sphere,
    make sure you’re well familiar with the variety of roles and the differences between
    them, which sometimes may be subtle and even overlap.
