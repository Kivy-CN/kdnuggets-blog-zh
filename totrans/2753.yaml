- en: Recently, I have come across several articles and conversations where Data Science
    & Analytics leaders across industries have been expressing concerns over the performance
    and reliability of AI/ML. The problem of concept drift or data drift is not new,
    but it has just made its presence felt very significantly with COVID-19\. In this
    article, I talk about some best practices to ensure the creation of resilient
    AI/ML solutions to tackle such data shifts.

- en: AI/ML has an extremely broad use-case across all industries and verticals. However,
    not all industries or use-cases are getting impacted by COVID triggered data shifts.
    As I assess and see around, only areas where AI/ML is being used to capture consumer/end-user
    behaviour have been impacted, because that is the only thing COVID has changed.
    So, for example, your Alexa has not suddenly stopped understanding English or
    self-driving cars have not forgotten how to drive because there is no user behaviour
    involved here. What has changed is our lifestyle, daily needs, online presence,
    etc. In a B2B market, what has changed is how companies are carrying out their
    business, what products are they consuming vs which ones are they shedding off.
    On top of these changes, the other problem is that the change is volatile. We
    see shifts, which themselves are driven by a lot of extraneous factors on a weekly
    basis.

- en: The problem primarily exists because AI/ML uses historical data to profile behaviours
    and predict future events. If the recent behaviours have changed drastically and
    continue to be volatile, it makes sense that static AI/ML solutions would not
    stand a chance and would be inaccurate at best and misleading at worst.

- en: While there is no definitive and exhaustive guidebook to get around this, and
    depending upon the problem statement at hand, one may have to employ one or more
    strategies in different permutations and combinations. Below are some of the ways
    that I think can help in that direction.

- en: One of the key things I have learned as a data science leader is that a successful
    data science team should always have the capability to monitor underlying data
    and analytical features. This is a key step to take control of your advanced analytics
    strategy, where you have a direct line of sight on how your data is faring and
    how your models are performing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am not talking about ad hoc monitoring, which I sense most of us already do
    on-demand as we see our end goals are not being met by an analytical solution.
    I am talking about creating proactive measures with the ability to alert solution
    owners on possible deteriorations in data shifts, outcome degradation, etc.

- en: Agility is key to everything, and so is AI/ML. Ask yourself whether your model
    requires retraining for every change in feature distribution or has some degree
    of dynamism built into the way you have engineered features and your model. What
    is the kind of effort it would take to make your solution more sensitive to recent
    data to track recent user behaviour? How easy is it to make human corrections
    to the weights that you are giving to different decision parameters? Can rule-based
    business filters be applied over your AI/ML workflow?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dynamic features, self-learning models, ability to increase the sensitivity
    of your solutions, and ease of introducing human corrections in your AI/ML decision
    flow are key in deciding how agile your data science and analytical solutions
    are in making quick tweaks to accommodate for changing data patterns. A termed
    that has been coined for this is MLOps, similar to DevOps in technology, to bring
    similar agility into the Data Science domain.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because what we call as normal has shifted, it does warrant that data scientists
    revisit the definitions of their outcome variables to see if what they have been
    calling abnormal is the new normal and vice versa. Can our data fall in a new
    category that was nonexistent prior to or have some categories vanished? Questions
    should also be asked on how your model treats new data points that have not been
    seen earlier during training? Does it outcast them as a positive or negative outlier
    or consider them as a part of the normal population, more of a use-case based
    decision that may need to be taken.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this section may not be applicable everywhere, however, wherever possible,
    one should explore for methodologies that do not require a normal profile to train
    rather have intrinsic ability to find outliers in the data basis the given sample.
    The statement is mainly applicable for outlier based detection systems in unsupervised
    and hybrid setups.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that our current data may have shifted drastically from what we have seen
    in past, trusting past model performances that we may have established during
    training, test and validation would no longer provide the real picture. Data science
    units should move as much as possible to real-time validation setups using A/B
    testing to be able to observe how the model is faring against a scenario with
    no AI/ML solution in the current setup.

- en: As I read it somewhere, AI/ML is living and breathing. So, as with any other
    living and breathing object, it requires constant care and intervention. One cannot
    build an AI/ML solution and go away. Data science setups, in my perspective, should
    invest around 20-30% of their effort in monitoring, management, and potential
    enhancements to be successful.

    performance? What other techniques is your team employing to curb the potential
    impact of frequent data shifts?
