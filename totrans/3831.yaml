- en: Last year, GitHub publicly unveiled **[Copilot](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/07/github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer.html)**,
    the preview of its "AI pair programmer," a code completion style tool designed
    to provide line or function suggestions in your IDE. It has certainly made waves
    in the world of programming and beyond, and you have likely heard at least something
    about it.

- en: But Copilot is more than simple autocomplete and is more context aware than
    other code assistants. Powered by OpenAI's Codex AI system, Copilot contextualizes
    a situation using docstrings, function names, comments, and preceding code to
    best generate and suggest what it determines to be the most appropriate code.
    Copilot is designed to improve over time, "learning" from how developers use it.

    you need at your fingertips, saving you time and helping you stay focused.

- en: Currently available for Visual Studio Code and platforms powered by a VS Code
    backend — such as GitHub's Codespaces — Copilot "understands" dozens of languages,
    with the technical preview being noted as doing "especially well for Python, JavaScript,
    TypeScript, Ruby, and Go." You can accept default code suggestions, cycle through
    additional proposals, modify the code you accept, or ignore Copilot suggestions
    at a particular point in your code altogether.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Presently, Copilot is only available via [approved request](https://copilot.github.com/).
    But fret not; open source alternatives of varying specification exist, and are
    available for you to try out right now.

- en: Let's have a look at 4 code-generation and -suggestion alternatives to GitHub
    Copilot that you can use in your programming today. Though my investigation into
    these was prompted by the discovery of Second Mate (below), I have listed the
    options in descending order by number of GitHub stars, as it seemed as good a
    way to do so as any.

    a code *suggestion* tool, as opposed to code generation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This feature is somewhat similar to [Github Copilot's](https://copilot.github.com/)
    code suggestion. But instead of using AI, it sends your search query to Google,
    then retrieves StackOverflow answers and autocompletes them for you.

- en: This extension also sits completely atop this other clone of Github Copilot
    aptly named [Captain Stack](https://github.com/hieunc229/copilot-clone), since
    instead of synthesizing the answers using deep learning, it extracts them from
    StackOverflow posts.

    to hold you over until Copilot is released to the masses. You might even find
    that one of these are useful enough to work for you long term. Thanks to the respective
