- en: Every year, an international Data Science challenge is organised by the association
    in order to promote students skills in this domain. The challenge has two phases
    and the teams gather four students with no more than one PhD student. The first
    step of the challenge is online which gives a ranking. This ranking is based on
    the performance of the solutions given by the different teams to the problem they
    had to solve and the top 20 teams are allowed to compete in the second phase of
    the challenge. Two teams of the same university cannot be selected for this final
    phase.
