- en: There is a lot of confusion these days about Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine
    Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). There certainly is a massive uptick of articles
    about AI being a competitive game changer and that enterprises should begin to
    seriously explore the opportunities. The distinction between AI, ML and DL are
    very clear to practitioners in these fields. AI is the all encompassing umbrella
    that covers everything from Good Old Fashion AI (GOFAI) all the way to connectionist
    architectures like Deep Learning. ML is a sub-field of AI that covers anything
    that has to do with the study of learning algorithms by training with data. There
    are whole swaths (not swatches) of techniques that have been developed over the
    years like Linear Regression, K-means, Decision Trees, Random Forest, PCA, SVM
    and finally Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Artificial Neural Networks is where
    the field of Deep Learning had its genesis from.

- en: Some ML practitioners who have had previous exposure to Neural Networks (ANN),
    after all it was invented in the early 60’s, would have the first impression that
    Deep Learning is nothing more than ANN with multiple layers. Furthermore, the
    success of DL is more due to the availability of more data and the availability
    of more powerful computational engines like Graphic Processing Units (GPU). This
    of course is true, the emergence of DL is essentially due to these two advances,
    however the conclusion that DL is just a better algorithm than SVM or Decision
    Trees is akin to focusing only on the trees and not seeing the forest.

    eating ML”. Two publications by practitioners of different machine learning fields
    have summarized it best as to why DL is taking over the world. Chris Manning an
    expert in NLP writes about the “[Deep Learning Tsunami](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00239)“:'

    several years now, but 2015 seems like the year when the full force of the tsunami
    hit the major Natural Language Processing (NLP) conferences. However, some pundits
    are predicting that the final damage will be even worse.

- en: It might be simply because deep learning on highly complex, hugely determined
    in terms of degrees of freedom graphs once endowed with massive amount of annotated
    data and unthinkable — until very recently — computing power can solve all computer
    vision problems. If this is the case, well it is simply a matter of time that
    industry (which seems to be already the case) takes over, research in computer
    vision becomes a marginal academic objective and the field follows the path of
    computer graphics (in terms of activity and volume of academic research).

    disruptive to conventional ML practices. Certainly it should be equally disruptive
    in the business world. I am however stunned and perplexed that even Gartner fails
    to recognize the difference between ML and DL. Here is Gartner’s August 2016 Hype
    Cycle and Deep Learning isn’t even mentioned on the slide:'

    a myopic notion of ML and are going to be blind sided by Deep Learning.

- en: Anyway, despite being ignored, DL continues to by hyped. The current DL hype
    tends to be that we have these commoditized machinery, that given enough data
    and enough training time, is able to learn on its own. This of course either an
    exaggeration of what the state-of-the-art is capable of or an over simplification
    of the actual practice of DL. DL has over the past few years given rise to a massive
    collection of ideas and techniques that were previously either unknown or known
    to be untenable. At first this collection of concepts, seems to be fragmented
    and disparate. However over time patterns and methodologies begin to emerge and
    we are frantically attempting to cover this space in “[Design Patterns of Deep
    Learning](http://www.deeplearningpatterns.com/)“.

- en: Deep Learning today goes beyond just multi-level perceptrons but instead is
    a collection of techniques and methods that are used to building composable differentiable
    architectures. These are extremely capable machine learning systems that we are
    only right now seeing just the tip of the iceberg. The key take away from this
    is that, Deep Learning may look like alchemy today, but we eventually will learn
    to practice it like chemistry. That is, we would have a more solid foundation
    so as to be able to build our learning machines with greater predictability of
    its capabilities.
