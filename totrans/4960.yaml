    its new Python library for interpreting predictive models. Skater uses a combination
    of algorithms to explain the relationships between the data that go into a model
    and the predictions it makes, allowing users to assess a model’s performance and
    identify key features.

    such as scoring the creditworthiness of loan applicants, recommending relevant
    content to viewers, and predicting the amount of money online shoppers will spend
    — interpretation is also becoming an indispensable part of the model-building
    process. Skater provides a common framework for describing predictive models regardless
    of the algorithm used to build them, giving data science practitioners the freedom
    to use the technique of their choice without worrying about its complexity.

    regression or decision trees because the resulting model is easy to interpret,”
    said DataScience.com Chief Strategy Officer William Merchan. “In effect, he or
    she is sacrificing performance for interpretability; for example, neural networks
    or ensembles are harder to explain but produce highly accurate predictions. Skater
    aims to eliminate this compromise.”

    that describes the modeled relationship between a predictor and a target, and
    variable importance, a measure of the degree to which features drive predictions.
    It also improves upon existing methods for model interpretation like Local Interpretable
    Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). Skater allows these methods to be applied
    to any machine learning model — from ensembles to neural nets — whether it is
    available locally or deployed as an API.

    Skater allows for model interpretation on both the global and local level by leveraging
    and improving upon a combination of existing techniques including partial dependence
    plots, relative variable importance, and LIME.'

    can use Skater to understand how features relate to one another in specific use
    cases — such as how a credit risk model uses a bank customer’s credit history,
    checking account status, or number of existing credit lines to approve or deny
    his or her application for a credit card — and then use that information to inform
    future analyses.'

    the opportunity to measure how feature interactions change across different model
    versions.'

    is the ability to deploy models behind a REST API to make them instantly available
    for integration with dashboards or real-time applications,” Merchan added. “Skater
    is helping us take that one step further by making it possible to explain the
    complicated models deployed in our platform — or anywhere — in a way that is understandable
    to both data science practitioners and, ultimately, non-technical stakeholders.”
