    draw your conclusions. Data in, data out, where is the scope for creativity there?
    It is not like you are working with a blank canvas.

    out of nothing. This requires an incredible amount of imagination, and seeing
    past the obvious headline statistics to reach a deeper conclusion is the hallmark
    of a great Big Data professional.

    have interviews with us. They have no choice, moulding the data in unique and
    unexpected ways is their job. Just as Einstein found inspiration in his violin
    playing, many leading data scientists find that when their creative juices are
    flowing, they often find the most elegant solutions to the challenges that they
    face. These Data Creatives are some of hardest to find candidates – mainly due
    to the subjectivity involved. (See also a previous blog for more on [Data Creatives](http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140910155524-1724547-how-to-become-a-data-scientist))

    cannot be underestimated. As increasingly more people see Artificial Intelligence
    as the answer to all our data needs, I think that we will come up against a road
    block when humans will always have that crucial upper hand. Artificial intelligence
    might be able to do a good job of interpreting the data (in a fraction of the
    time), but it will never do an outstanding job. For that, creativity is the missing
    link.

    clear that harnessing their employees’ creativity is the key to getting them to
    collaborate more closely and have more empathy for each other. Data science does
    not exist in a vacuum, and it needs to relate to other areas in the business for
    it to have the maximum impact. Creatively packaging the numbers in a way that
    the rest of the business can understand is key to allow them to see the whole
    picture and therefore get behind finding the right solution.

    requires a decision to dive beneath the surface, and the risk that this entails.
    Accepting the data at face value will often be good enough, you will keep your
    job, and you won’t ruffle any feathers with whacky conclusions. When you are creative
    to suggest something that is not obvious to the untrained eye, you are sticking
    your neck out, and this requires courage. However, you only have to do it successfully
    a couple of times for your wider team to give you the latitude to do so in the
    future. If the employer culture is resistant to such deviant thinking, it will
    be that little bit harder, but it is still possible.
