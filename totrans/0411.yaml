    and especially to be a good one, you need these seven skills to do your job and
    stand out. These seven skills also transfer really well to other professions.

- en: The interesting thing about working in data science is that hard skills aren’t
    as in high demand as soft skills. Anyone can learn to code in Python. The company
    you work for might migrate to a new infrastructure next year. Hard skills are
    optional. Soft skills, by contrast, are non-negotiable and much harder to acquire.
    There’s no eight-week Bootcamp for business thinking. There’s no certificate for
    analytical problem-solving.

    translate technical use to businesses and back again with ease. As a data scientist,
    you have to communicate findings to a technical team in a way that makes sense
    to them, while also constructing a graph to help the business team understand
    the business implications of your awesome finding.'
  prefs: []

    business reason why they have to structure the data differently for you. Then
    you might need to share the outcome of that with your (business-side) boss to
    explain why they should care.
  prefs: []

    Only data scientists are asked to hop from technical to business on a daily basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How can you improve this? You can practice the business side of things with
    your non-technical friends and family. See if you can get them to care about your
    numbers. You can improve your technical team communication by asking the technical
    teams what they need from you, and how you can work more closely with them. Usually,
    they won’t be shy about giving you an answer.

- en: Many people think of data scientists as people who work with numbers day in
    and day out. Nothing could be further from the truth. While data scientists do
    crunch numbers and clean data, one of their primary roles is thinking about their
    findings critically, and asking the kinds of questions that affect businesses
    in the future.

- en: For example, let’s say a makeup company is asked to increase personalization
    to boost profits. A data scientist has to understand how the business works to
    be able to build a predictive model that allows her to say, “Well, hang on, the
    average customer has a loyalty card, right? We can use that to match transactions
    to individuals. Then we can predict that Customer A will want nail polish remover,
    while Customer B will be more interested in blush.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certain jobs will look at the numbers behind that. Others will look at customer
    behavior. Only the data scientist has to understand both. Knowing how the business
    works, and what the KPIs are, is critical to being a good data scientist.

- en: The best way to improve your business intelligence skills is by getting invested
    in a business - it doesn’t even have to be your own! Maybe there’s a potted plant
    company you love or a restaurant you adore. Get used to asking questions about
    how their businesses run, and what kinds of insights would be useful for them
    to grow. Then you can apply those skills to your own job.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data scientist runs into all kinds of thorny problems on a daily. However,
    data scientist doesn’t have time to fully address and unravel all these issues
    at their leisure. Instead, data scientists absolutely must be able to take a problem
    and think about it in a structured, analytical way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This comes back to data scientists being expected to straddle the technical
    and business sides of fences. Often, external clients or internal business teams
    will have a problem they’ll run by you. These teams may not have a clear idea
    of the outcome they’re expecting. It’s up to you as the data scientist to take
    the problem, simplify it down to its core elements, make assumptions, and think
    of ways to prove and solve it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists will also be slammed with complex and messy datasets, and they’ll
    be asked to dig through them to create predictive and useful models for the business
    to use. To do this, data scientists need a structured and logical approach to
    problem-solving.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Helpfully, there’s a great process to follow if you want to boost your structured
    thinking skills. First, understand how to identify problems. When you face a new
    scenario, think about the circumstances. Next, ask questions to get to the core
    of the problem. What’s the reason for this? What are you overlooking? After, determine
    your biases. Get into the habit of determining your assumptions. Next, anticipate
    the roadblocks – what could go wrong in the situation? What consequences could
    arise? Finally, practice coming up with answers without using Google. (You can
    use Google to check yourself, but you want to get into the habit of thinking independently.)

    how to build complex, sexy models. But data scientists also need to know when
    that isn’t necessary, and maybe when a simple analysis will suffice.
  prefs: []

    questions. Better data scientists instead keep their analyses simple enough to
    answer the question. That’s why one of the key skills that differentiate data
    scientists is avoiding complexity for the sake of complexity.

    are business people who will ask for technical things they don't understand. There
    will be technical people asking for things the business picture can’t allow. And
    in the middle, data scientists will need to work out who to accommodate and when.
    That requires a lot of calm, deep breaths.

    that he’s seen [data science companies](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/11-best-companies-to-work-for-as-a-data-scientist/)
    “demand that neural networks (because it is sexy) must be used in their project,
    even though it is completely inappropriate or underperforms compared to alternative
    algorithms.” The data scientist has to decide: do they figure out a way to make
    it work? Or do they tell their business lead this makes no sense?'

    you do, being assigned anything to do with data because it’s in your job title,

    Patience is a vital virtue for anyone in data science.

    anecdotes? By the end of their story, everyone’s laughing along with them. They
    have an impeccable sense of timing and storytelling. That’s the skill a data scientist
    needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So much of [data science is in storytelling](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-tell-your-story-in-an-interview/).
    Not just storytelling, but convincing storytelling. As the person who sits between
    the technical and business sides of the company, you need to share the numbers
    in a way that gets stakeholders to care. And a lot of that comes down to drama.
  prefs: []

    a relevant way. Data scientists need to do that with panache, style, and yes,
    drama.

    what you do and don’t like about the stories you’re consuming. What foreshadowing
    do they use? How does the hero’s journey convey emotion and results?

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s this idea that gut intuition is bad, and only data is good. That’s not
    quite true. After all, we hire humans, not machines, because machines can’t (yet)
    replicate our intuition and pattern identification.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to data science, pattern identification is a key soft skill. Data
    scientists have to sift through piles and piles of data until they get a feeling
    about a potentially significant signal. Then they have to look at the data again
    to back up their gut feeling. But having the ability to trust your gut to spot
    a pattern is as important as the technical skills needed to analyze the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s why many data scientists advocate leading with your gut and following
    the data. With so much data available, data scientists need to know where to look
    to begin. There are tons of fun word or math games you can use to practice your
    instinctive pattern recognition skills, like [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/practice/pattern-recognition-intro/).

    of occupying the business and technical hemispheres of a company. (Being able
    to walk that line also requires a bonus eighth soft skill: humor.) But a lot of
    these skills also rely on self-confidence, like trusting your gut; and personality,
    like being patient with repeated misunderstandings or ridiculous demands.'
