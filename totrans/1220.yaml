- en: Data science is undoubtedly one of the hottest career choices right now. Companies
    (many of whom have data science departments) are hiring data scientists around
    the board. It is a considerable thing to become a data scientist. It is also a
    fantastic opportunity to hone your expertise if you are already a statistician
    and want to step through the ranks.
