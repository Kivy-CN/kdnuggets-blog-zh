- en: A popular statistical technique to predict binomial outcomes (y = 0 or 1) is
    Logistic Regression. Logistic regression predicts categorical outcomes (binomial
    / multinomial values of y), whereas linear Regression is good for predicting continuous-valued
    outcomes (such as weight of a person in kg, the amount of rainfall in cm).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The predictions of Logistic Regression (henceforth, LogR in this article) are
    in the form of probabilities of an event occurring, ie the probability of y=1,
    given certain values of input variables x. Thus, the results of LogR range between
    0-1\.

    changes with the change in value of x, but the log-odds of the event remains constant
    with changing values of x.

    are taxed different amounts but are subject to the same tax rate. Suppose there
    is a tax of 30% for the $40000-$80000 tax bracket- the man earning $40000 pays
    $12000 as tax, and the man earning $80000 pays $24000 as tax, but the tax rate
    was constant (30%) for both people. The value of x (independent variable- earnings)
    changed, hence the y value (dependent variable- tax paid) also changed. But when
    considering a man earning $75000, and if talking purely in terms of 'earnings',
    one would have to mention the max, mean, min values of 'earnings' in order to
    correctly picture the y-value for $75000\. However, if talking purely in terms
    of the constant tax rate, one needs to consider only 1 number – the 30%, in order
    to predict his y-value correctly.

    x in terms of probability of an event, one would have to state 3 different probability
    values at the max, mean and min values of x- to derive the whole picture. But,
    log-odds is a single number that conveys the entire picture, as it remains constant
    inspite of change in x. Thus, for succinctness and to avoid the restricted range
    problem, log-odds is used to model the likelihood of an event; it is later converted
    into probability using the formula (e^ (Bt.X) )/(1+e^ (Bt.X) ).
