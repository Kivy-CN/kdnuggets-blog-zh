- en: Although data analytics and data science are quite unique disciplines, there
    is considerable overlap in the data processing steps used to effectively achieve
    them. Both benefit from having access to large amounts of high-quality data stored
    in a centralized location as well as efficient and reliable processes to bring
    data from sources to these central repositories. Until recently, work has been
    duplicated with separate technologies for the different fields, in a data warehouse
    for analytics and business intelligence and as a data lake for data science and
    machine learning. A number of new services are working on merging these data stacks
    into a single environment, and this article will provide an overview of these
    services and the value they can add to a data organization.

- en: A modern data stack is a collection of technologies that bring and store multiple
    data sources to a centralized cloud data warehouse that has become popular in
    analytics. It can be extended to accommodate machine learning workloads into something
    called the [modern data science stack](https://fivetran.com/blog/modern-data-science-stack).
    A modern data science stack removes silos and services performing duplicate work
    for data analytics and data science teams and moves models closer to data they
    are training with and using to make predictions, easing the shift from model-centric
    AI development to [data-centric AI development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo).
    Many organizations have a considerable investment in data warehousing technologies
    to keep the environment secure, governed, operational, organized and performant,
    but data loses all of these qualities the moment it is sampled from a data warehouse
    to a data lake.

    I discovered since my transition to a modern data science stack. Having models
    stored in a data warehouse means their predictions can be stored as well and obtained
    via SQL queries. Performing table lookups instead of requiring embedded models
    or frameworks to use machine learning can go a long way in democratizing the use
    of machine learning in an organization. Also, because each step of the machine
    learning process happens in the same place on the same data, there is less of
    a chance for differences between data being sent to models at training time and
    at serving time, which means [training-serving skew](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/tfdv#skewdetect)
    and the tools used to detect it can largely be avoided.  Finally, since every
    step of the machine learning process can be performed as SQL, it becomes straightforward
    to compose the different steps together into a data pipeline with a tool like
    Apache Airflow.

    Redshift, Google Cloud Platform’s and AWS’s respective data warehouses. AWS just
    recently announced the general availability of [Redshift ML](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/05/aws-announces-general-availability-of-amazon-redshift-ml/),

- en: Both extend SQL syntax with a CREATE MODEL command that allows for the creation
    of machine learning models and the specification of parameters such as model type,
    the table to be used as training data, and the target feature to generate predictions
    on. These new SQL commands leverage automated machine learning processes to provide
    data transformations and model tuning to identify the best performance among candidate
    models. Custom models can be used with each as well and offer considerable flexibility
    in model architecture and performance, but each has some restrictions in development.
    Custom models have to be saved as TensorFlow models to be used in BigQuery, and
    Redshift ML must use models deployed with the AWS data science development platform
    SageMaker. Once models are either trained or imported into the warehouse, SELECT
    statements can be used with FROM specifying a trained model in place of a table
    to invoke inferences, which can then easily be inserted into a predictions table
    in the warehouse for use, auditing, and error analysis.

    that their “entire initiative in AI and ML has been to build extensibility into
    [their data warehouse] so you can interface with your tool of choice.” AWS’s Sagemaker
    platform mentioned earlier is an example of an ML tool Snowflake can integrate
    with, and Databricks is as well. More impressive development is happening at Databricks,
    which just released [version 1.0.0 of Delta Lake](https://delta.io/news/delta-lake-1-0-0-released/),
    which converges data analytics and data science technology stacks from the opposite
    direction. Instead of bringing machine learning capabilities to a data warehouse,
    Delta Lake adds traditional analytics and business intelligence capabilities like
    ACID transactions to a data lake into a new data lakehouse architecture that provides
    similar benefits to a modern data science stack.'

- en: If your organization is interested in performing both data analytics and data
    science, there are a number of options to facilitate the two disciplines, but
    there’s too much in common between their data pipelines to have separate tooling
    for data ingestion, storage, and transformations for separate workloads. In-warehouse
    machine learning tools can be used to build a modern data science stack that can
    remove the silos that occur in the data engineering and model serving components
    of a data science practice by moving everything data and the practitioners operating
    on that data to a centralized location.
