- en: PlotNeuralNet does not work directly from existing architecture code. Instead,
    you have to separately and explicitly define network code for the program to consume
    and use to output its diagram. This makes PlotNeuralNet library agnostic, but
    you trade some additional manual work for this.

    want to use them? That's easy; just use a cloud-based Latex editor like Overleaf
    to generate the image and save it to your computer from there. Now use it in your
    blog post or wherever else you want it.
