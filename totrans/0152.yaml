- en: ChatGPT has generated excitement and concern in equal measure across many use
    cases. One of its most prominent — and controversial — is its use in schools.
    As ChatGPT’s popularity continues to skyrocket, many school districts are banning
    it, but its potential positives for education are growing, too.

    of the most significant reasons behind school bans on ChatGPT.

- en: The most prevalent concern over ChatGPT in schools is its tendency towards plagiarism.
    Like all AI models, ChatGPT doesn’t necessarily create new content but rather
    compiles, summarizes and rephrases existing work. Students can easily use it to
    finish their work for them, to the same effect as stealing someone else’s paper
    and turning it in.

- en: Many tools [can detect ChatGPT-generated content](/2023/05/top-10-tools-detecting-chatgpt-gpt4-bard-llms.html),
    so catching students trying to cheat is relatively easy. However, even if students
    only use it as a research tool, they may be unable to find the original sources
    for the information they get from ChatGPT, leading to accidental plagiarism. The
    lack of consent from the people behind the model’s training data introduces further
    plagiarism concerns.

    The answers ChatGPT provides [are not always accurate](/2023/05/chatgpt-trusted-educational-resource.html),
    even if they’re convincing, which could lead students to believe misleading or
    outright false information.
  prefs: []

    if they’re about topics teachers are less familiar with. As a result, using it
    in research or as a teaching tool could spread misinformation.

    amount of user data, and its privacy controls are minimal and not immediately
    evident. Considering the education sector was the [most likely to suffer ransomware
    attacks](https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/c949g7693gsnjh9rb9gr8/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2023-wp.pdf)

    workflows with tools like ChatGPT would help minimize that time and expense.

    out themselves, helping them learn what makes a quality essay. Alternatively,
    teachers could use ChatGPT as a way to show how AI works or to highlight the importance
    of watching for bias and misinformation in online resources.
