    context of images and build visual systems which truly understand intelligence.
    The huge amount of image and video content urges the scientific community to make
    sense and identify patterns amongst it to reveal details which we aren’t aware
    of. Computer Vision generates mathematical models from images; Computer Graphics
    draws in images from models and lastly image processing takes image as an input
    and gives an image at the output.

    as artificial intelligence, digital image processing, machine learning, deep learning,
    pattern recognition, probabilistic graphical models, scientific computing and
    a lot of mathematics. So, take this post as a starting point to dwell into this
    field. I will try to cover as much as possible in this post but still there will
    be a lot of advanced topics and some cools things which might be left out (maybe
    for later posts?).

    by following [GaTech Prof. James Hays](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/)’
    projects of his Computer Vision class. These assignments are also on MATLAB. Do
    not skip these. You only get the deep understanding of the algorithms and equations

    Vision. Although Coursera has removed this content from the website, you should
    be able to find that somewhere on the internet. Things now seem to look interesting
    and will definitely give you a feel of how complex yet simple models are built
    for machine vision systems. This course should also be a stepping stone to get
    going with academic papers.
