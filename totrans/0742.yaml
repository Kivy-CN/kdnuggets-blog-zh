    However, what makes data scientist skills different from the others? It’s not
    an easy question to answer as data scientists are a big umbrella, and the job
    responsibilities and the skills required differ for each company. Nevertheless,
    there are skills that data scientists will need if they want to stand out from
    the others.

- en: This article will discuss five essential skills for data scientists in 2024\.
    I would not discuss **Programming Language** or **Machine Learning** as they are
    always necessary skills. I also don’t talk about Generative AI skills as those
    are trending skills, but data science is bigger than that. I would only discuss
    further emerging skills essential for the 2024 landscape.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud computing is a service over the internet (“Cloud”) that could include
    servers, analytical software, networking, security, and many more. It’s designed
    to scale to the user's preferences and deliver resources as required.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the current data science trend, many companies have started implementing
    cloud computing to scale their business or to minimize infrastructure costs. From
    small startups to big companies, the usage of cloud computing has become apparent.
    That’s why you can start to see that the current data science job posting would
    require you to have cloud computing experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many cloud computing services, but you don’t need to learn everything,
    as mastering one means navigating to the other platforms more easily. If you have
    difficulty deciding which to learn initially, you could start with a bigger one,
    such as AWS, GCP, or Azure platform.

- en: Machine Learning Operations, or MLOps, is a collection of techniques and tools
    for deploying ML models in production. MLOps aims to avoid the *technical debt*
    from our Machine Learning application by streamlining the deployment of ML models
    in production, improving model quality and performance while implementing best
    practices in CI/CD, with continuous monitoring of machine learning models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MLOps has become one of the most sought-after skills for data scientists, and
    you can see the surge of MLOps requirements in job postings. Previously, the MLOps
    works could be delegated to a Machine Learning Engineer. However, the requirements
    for Data Scientists to understand MLOps have become bigger than ever. This is
    because Data Scientists must ensure that their machine learning model is ready
    to be integrated with the production environment, which only the model creator
    knows the best.

- en: That’s why learning about MLOps in 2024 is beneficial if you want to advance
    your data science career. To learn more about the MLOps topic, refer to [KDnuggets'
    first Tech Brief](/tech-brief-everything-you-need-to-know-about-mlops), which
    discusses everything about MLOps.

- en: Big Data can be described as the Three V’s, which comprise **Volume,** which
    refers to the massive quantities of the generated data; **Velocity,** which explains
    how fast the data is produced and processed; and **Variety,** which refers to
    various data types (structured to unstructured).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Big Data technologies have become important in many companies, as many of the
    insights and products rely on how they can do something with the Big Data they
    have. It’s one thing to have big data, but only by processing it can companies
    get value from it. This is why many companies are now trying to recruit data scientists
    who possess big data technology skills.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists need technical skills and strong domain expertise to advance
    their careers. A junior data scientist might want to model machine learning to
    achieve the highest technical metrics, but the senior one understands that our
    model should bring business values above everything else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Domain expertise means we understand the industry's business we are working
    on. By understanding the business, we could better align with the business user,
    select better metrics for the model, and frame the projects in a way that impacts
    the business. In 2024, it’s especially become more important as businesses start
    to understand how data science could bring significant value.
  prefs: []

    effectively learned if we are already working as data scientists in that industry.
    So, how could one acquire this skill if we are not working in the industry we
    want? There are a few ways, including:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some might see data as numbers or words in the database without concern for
    the individual that these data describe. However, much of this data was private
    information that could harm the users and the business if we mishandled it. The
    topic is becoming even more important in this modern era as data collection and
    processing become easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ethics in data science is concerned with the moral principles that guide how
    data scientists should work. The field covers the potential impact of our data
    science project on individuals and society, which should follow the best moral
    decision we could take. The topic usually concerns bias, fairness, explainability,
    and consent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, Data Privacy is a field concerned with the legality of how
    we collect, process, manage, and share data. It aims to protect the personal information
    coming from the individual and avoid misuse. Each area might have a different
    data privacy framework; for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    in Europe usually applies only to personal data in Europe.
  prefs: []

    as the consequences of breaking them are severe. The article from Nisha Arya on
    [Ethics](/2023/04/ethics-ai-navigating-future-intelligent-machines.html) and [Data
    Privacy](/2022/01/celebrating-awareness-importance-data-privacy.html) could become
    your starting point for understanding these topics further.
