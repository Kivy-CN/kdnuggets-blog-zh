  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With exponential growth in enterprise data, traditional methods of handling
    huge data volume quickly become inefficient. Organizations face a challenge in
    aggregating, maintaining, and generating value from their vast volumes of data.
    Among the most prominent hurdles that arise is the creation of multiple data repositories
    or data silos, leading to issues in the identification and management of data.
    The lack of skilled resources and poor understanding of data handling from disparate
    sources also acts as a bottleneck towards taking better data management initiatives.
    Without proper data management, businesses may fail to ensure the security and
    privacy of data, which can lead to financial and potential legal consequences.

- en: 1\. Growing Data Silos Amongst Multifaceted Distributed Systems
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data silos occur when data is stored in separate and disconnected systems, departments,
    or business units, making it difficult to access, share, and integrate. As organizations
    collect more data from various sources, data silos can grow, creating challenges
    for data integration, analytics, and decision-making.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data integration complexities arise when attempting to combine and synchronize
    data from multiple sources, especially when dealing with disparate data formats,
    inconsistent data quality, and varying data structures. Integration complexities
    can make it challenging to establish a single source of truth and derive accurate
    insights from the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To overcome these challenges, organizations must adopt a comprehensive data
    integration strategy that includes data governance, quality management, and integration
    tools and technologies.

- en: 2\. Inherent Complexity of Data Architecture
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Modern data strategies can only be implemented by evolving the existing data
    architectures. The inherent complexity of such architectures necessitates an overhaul
    of the associated underlying technologies, which can be an expensive and time-intensive
    undertaking. Furthermore, if legacy systems are not updated to meet modern-day
    business needs, data silos can become challenging to integrate, causing insufficient
    or inaccurate information to be shared across business units. Data architectures,
    thus, need to be flexible and adaptable to modern demands to ensure seamless and
    continuous data analysis, which further fuels innovation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most businesses still practice the waterfall approach to data sharing. However,
    a flexible data architecture must ensure seamless inter-department collaboration
    over data. This can be achieved by adopting DataOps principles within a data management
    strategy, as DataOps focuses on automating the seamless flow of data within an
    organization. In addition to flexibility, DataOps introduces the much-needed agility
    to rapidly scale data pipelines in alignment with the organization’s growth.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Organizations must implement proper data governance practices to enable data
    integrity and usability with easy accessibility. This ensures that data is trustworthy,
    flows seamlessly, and is protected from misuse. However, while implementing data
    governance, organizations must circumvent issues such as lack of skilled data
    governance leadership and resources, poor quality of data, and absence of control
    over enterprise data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data governance and compliance go hand in hand. Lapses in data governance practices
    and policies can lead to regulatory compliance infringements. Regulatory bodies
    can impose fines and penalties depending on the nature and severity of the infringement
    and the local governing laws and regulations. Such violations can attract a penalty
    of up to [€20 million or 4% of the annual gross revenue](https://gdpr-info.eu/) of
    the previous financial year (whichever is greater). In addition, businesses can
    be subject to one or multiple lawsuits in instances of data misuse or breaches
    by the affected parties. In severe cases, the operational workflow can be disrupted
    for extended periods when increased regulatory scrutiny is imposed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address data governance and compliance challenges, organizations need to
    establish clear policies and procedures, assign responsibilities, train employees,
    and implement appropriate technical and organizational controls. They also need
    to regularly monitor and audit their data practices to ensure ongoing compliance
    and continuous improvement.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Large data volume presents a critical challenge for businesses to keep sensitive
    data and personal identifiable information (PII) private. Furthermore, as cyberattacks
    and data breaches become more prevalent, the costs of investing and updating old
    security tools and infrastructure rise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to Check Point Research (CPR), cybersecurity attacks increased by [28%
    by the third quarter of 2022 compared to 2021](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2022/10/26/third-quarter-of-2022-reveals-increase-in-cyberattacks/#:~:text=Global%20attacks%20increased%20by%2028,organization%20worldwide%20reached%20over%201%2C130), indicating
    an increased potential in vulnerability to data breaches and misuse. With a rapid
    rise in business infrastructures adopting a digital model, strong security measures
    and practices must be deployed to safeguard data privacy and ensure its integrity.
    Under the umbrella of data management strategy, physical and digital access to
    data must be strictly enforced via authentication. In the advent of a system failure,
    data corruption, or unforeseen disasters, proper recovery measures must also be
    in place to recover data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Businesses must invest in data collection and categorization tools to segregate
    data that falls under regulatory obligations. Organizations must create stringent
    policies and procedures for managing data, including data retention, data quality,
    and data access. The solution should incorporate categorizing data based on its
    sensitivity and applying appropriate security controls based on the data's classification.
    Continuous risk assessments must be undertaken as necessitated to identify potential
    risks to data security and privacy and implement measures to mitigate those risks.

- en: Data ecosystems, which refer to the interconnected network of data sources,
    tools, technologies, and stakeholders, face several challenges. For example, ensuring
    data interoperability between different systems and platforms can be challenging.
    It requires establishing common data standards, protocols, and interfaces. Moreover,
    extracting meaningful insights from the data is a significant challenge in data
    ecosystems. It requires the use of advanced analytics tools, techniques, and skills
    to derive valuable insights from complex and large datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative effort from all stakeholders
    involved in the data ecosystem. Organizations must adopt a holistic approach to
    data management, focusing on data quality, integration, privacy, security, governance,
    scalability, and analysis. This requires a combination of technological solutions,
    such as data integration platforms, data analytics tools, and security software,
    as well as organizational change, including process improvements, training, and
    communication.

    can enrich data ecosystems. NLP, combined with process automation, can be used
    to convert raw and unstructured data to structured data. On the other hand, ML
    models can aid in evolving the operational logic within a data ecosystem and reduce
    the burden of human intervention to a minimum.
