    how data science is actually done, nor what it is exactly. They sort of jumped
    on the bandwagon — without really understanding it, nor why it was important to
    them in a very visceral way.

- en: Many organizations approach data science as though it was a marketing tool —
    relabeling things that they already do as ‘data science’ as it involves the use
    of data. That is not real data science, and it completely misses the point of
    engaging in data science. It would be the equivalent of comparing kids playing
    in their sandboxes with the operations of the oil majors when they are scouting
    for oil. The core value of data science, which appears to be overlooked, is the
    word science.

    diagnostic. Science leads to engineering — a systematic mathematical approach
    to creating technology solutions based on the exploitation of some natural phenomenon.

    start, I suppose – even though the best models in Kaggle are actually built by
    machines running genetic algorithms, where natural selection drives the outcome.
    For all its limitations, Kaggle is certainly a good training ground to get one’s
    feet wet.

    that results in the data that you observe. It is about exploiting that knowledge
    to derive statistically significant pockets of value, to drive operational change
    into an enterprise, resulting in the creation of measurable ROI. It is about systematically
    driving the decision-making process, in a repeatable, scalable, and iterative
    way.

    is when you can claim you have done real data science — it means you fundamentally
    understand how your business works at a very granular level.

    — but that isn’t just some low-level thoughtless job — cleaning intelligently
    requires you to understand the solution as you refine the solution iteratively
    by paying careful attention to: + what matters and + why it matters and + how
    it matters. The word cleaning should be eliminated in favor of the word curation.'

- en: If you don’t understand the endgame, you will inevitably botch the launch off
    the starting line — and then wonder why you don’t see any results for all the
    work you’ve put in. You are constructing a well curated data set that conforms
    to a certain standard of quality to ensure that your model reflects the simple
    truth you are trying to uncover, capture, and/or replicate. This requires some
    intuition about what you are modeling and its inherently complex, possibly layered,
    structure. Merely curve fitting and claiming that “you have a model” is barely
    table stakes, and certainly offers no sustainable competitive advantage over your
    competition. The real question is whether you understand the science of your business.

- en: You need to know when you are throwing out the baby with the bathwater. There
    is a fine line between feature engineering and data cleansing — you might just
    be cleansing out the most important stuff that is telling you what is really going
    on! So, NO, any random fresh graduate is unlikely to get this right — it’s just
    not that simple. It is actually telling that many data scientists I interview
    don’t understand that data cleansing is also modeling in a very real sense — because
    to identify noise, you have to have a model of the signal! There’s a reason why
    companies still pay top dollar for the 0.1% talent pool.
