    to enjoy thinking about math like a programmer. With accessible examples, scenarios,
    and exercises perfect for the working developer, you’ll start by exploring functions
    and geometry in 2D and 3D. With those basic building blocks behind you, you’ll
    move into the bread and butter math for machine learning and game programming,
    including matrices and linear transformations, derivatives and integrals, differential
    equations, probability, classification algorithms, and more. Don’t worry if it
    sounds intimidating or, worse yet, boring! Paul’s writing style makes everything
    come alive so learning these vital concepts is painless, relevant, and fun.
