    Transformers help machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
    In this course, you will be able to explain the concept of attention mechanisms
    in transformers and also be able to describe language modelling with the decoder-based
    GPT and encoder-based BERT. You will then move on to implementing positional encoding,
    masking, attention mechanism, document classification, and creating LLMs like
    GPT and BERT.
