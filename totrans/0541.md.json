["```py\nML_Model_for_Predicting_Ships_Crew_Size\n\nAuthor: Benjamin O. Tayo\n\nDate: 4/8/2019\n\nWe build a simple model using the cruise_ship_info.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size. This project is organized as follows: \n(a) data preprocessing and variable selection; \n(b) basic regression model; \n(c) hyper-parameters tuning; and \n(d) techniques for dimensionality reduction.\n\ncruise_ship_info.csv: dataset used for model building.\n\nShip_Crew_Size_ML_Model.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook containing code.\n\n```"]
