    to just over 175 articles! One fault in some of my previous articles is that I
    suggested data science projects that were interesting **but not practical.**

    already completed similar projects and work as the job posting itself. Therefore,
    I want to share with you some **practical** data science projects that I’ve personally
    done throughout my career that will beef up your experience and your portfolio.

    of this: instead of sending an email advertisement where there’s a 0%-100% chance
    of a user clicking it, with propensity modeling, you can target users with a 50%+
    chance of clicking it. Fewer emails, more conversions!'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Metric forecasting is self-explanatory — it refers to forecasting a given metric,
    like revenue or the total number of users, in the short-term future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Specifically, forecasting involves techniques that use historical data as inputs
    to generate a predicted output. Even if the output itself is not entirely accurate,
    forecasting can be used to gauge the general trend of where a particular metric
    is going.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Why?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Forecasting is basically like looking into the future. By predicting (with some
    level of confidence) what will happen in the future, you can make more informed
    decisions more proactively. The result of this is that you’ll have more time to
    make decisions and ultimately reduce the likelihood of failure.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    relevant information to users, whether that be similar products on Amazon, similar
    TV shows on Netflix, or similar songs on Spotify.
  prefs: []

    and content-based filtering.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    previously chosen items’ features. For example, if I watched a lot of action movies
    previously, it would rank other action movies higher.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Collaborative filtering*, on the other hand, filters items that a user might
    like based on the reactions of similar users. For example, if I liked Song A and

- en: Recommendation systems are one of the most widely used and most practical data
    science applications. Not only that, but it also has one of the highest ROIs when
    it comes to data products. [It’s estimated that Amazon increased its sales by
    29% in 2019, specifically due to its recommendation system.](https://rejoiner.com/resources/amazon-recommendations-secret-selling-online/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CJudging%20by%20Amazon's%20success,%20the,the%20same%20time%20last%20year.) As
    well, [Netflix claimed that its recommendation system was worth a staggering $1
    billion in 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-recommendation-engine-worth-1-billion-per-year-2016-6)!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    By providing users with more **relevant** products, shows, or songs, you’re ultimately
    increasing their likelihood to purchase more and/or stay engaged longer.
