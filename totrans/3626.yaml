    machine learning in all areas of knowledge, through the concept of hyperautomation,
    which involves a combination of many technologies, in addition to AI and machine
    learning, such as augmented analytics, IoT, iBPM and RPA. AI and ML will be increasingly
    used in the cybersecurity field, in corporate systems, smart cities and smart
    homes. The AIoT, union of Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things will
    also be a key trend, enabling to create solutions with more efficient operations,
    improving the interaction between machine and humans, and also gain more robustness
    in data analysis.

    the convergence of AI and DevSecOps in IT operations, as AIOps; a wake-up call
    to data scientists about the importance of both data drift and concept drift in
    our deployed models, particularly highlighted in the failure of previously successful
    models during COVID pandemic; the rise of diverse hybrid data architectures that
    include edge computing, edge-to-cloud, and fog computing; a rejuvenation of distributed
    data mining (popular 10-15 years ago) under the label "Federated Machine Learning",
    enabling incremental model training on distributed data sets without moving the
    data; the enormous widespread interest and investments in Data Literacy across
    all organizations and sectors of the market; and the growing awakening to IoT

    enabler of a new corporate Observability Strategy (as the reason why you do it).'

    AI, machine learning and data science is; so many are still talking about python/coding/software,
    but not many showing real life examples of how these great fields can help society
    "solve problems" - AI is reduced to chat bots, machine learning becomes character
    and or object recognition on some "big box site" to classify products or find
    similar products or recommendations... Now I'm not saying there isn't some really
    cool stuff being done, especially with Covid being on the forefront of everyone's
    mind, data science is being used as well as machine learning to find hotspots
    and/or aid in contact tracing which will help curb the rise in new infections.
    You know data science, analytics and machine learning were and continue to be
    used in the aid of all the vaccines that are coming out but as we've seen in the
    "reliability" and "reproduction" department aka "AstraZeneca/Oxford's COVID vaccine
    data", data quality and the ability to involve representative samples are still
    big issues.

    let's remember anytime we start a project - check your data, query and follow
    up on anomalies, don't assume anything. Interesting sidenote, at Thanksgiving
    dinner, outside and socially distant, my mother shows me this video of two "people
    dancing" I said ah "that's nice" and smiled - she said - Did you notice those
    two "people" were robots? Well, dancing is just math, right (wink, however, similar
    to AI paintings, no soul) 2021 and beyond have limitless capabilities of what
    we can do, so let's move machine learning and data science forward by remember
    the basics - reproducibility, transparency, accuracy and is it representative
    of true life and form - we have to get away from the black box type thinking period
    - just because it worked in a college setting or lab setting doesn't necessarily

    model, KNOW your audience... know your end game, what is the purpose or function
    and then - of course be logical - but also be PRACTICAL...
