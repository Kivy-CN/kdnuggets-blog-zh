  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), architecture is inspired by the biological
    neural network of the human brain. The network consists of interconnected layers,
    input, hidden, and output. Each layer contains multiple neurons that are connected
    to every neuron in the adjacent layer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As data moves through the network, each connection applies a weight, and each
    neuron applies an activation function like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh. These functions
    introduce non-linearity, making it possible for the network to learn from errors
    and make complex decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During training, a technique called backpropagation is used to adjust these
    weights. This technique uses gradient descent to minimize a predefined loss function,
    aiming to make the network's predictions as accurate as possible.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed specifically for tasks that
    involve spatial hierarchies, like image recognition. The network uses specialized
    layers called convolutional layers to apply a series of filters to an input image,
    producing a set of feature maps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These feature maps are then passed through pooling layers that reduce their
    dimensionality, making the network computationally more efficient. Finally, one
    or more fully connected layers perform classification.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) differ in that they have an internal loop,
    or recurrent architecture, that allows them to store information. This makes them
    ideal for handling sequential data, as each neuron can use its internal state
    to remember information from previous time steps in the sequence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While processing the data, the network takes into account both the current and
    previous inputs, allowing it to develop a kind of short-term memory. However,
    RNNs can suffer from issues like vanishing and exploding gradients, which make
    learning long-range dependencies in data difficult.
  prefs: []
