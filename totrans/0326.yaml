- en: As I reflect on my days as a student, I now realize that there were a few crucial
    elements that were missing from my data science resume. These shortcomings probably
    resulted in my being rejected for various job positions. Not only was I unable
    to present myself as a valuable asset to potential teams, but I also struggled
    to showcase my ability to solve data science problems. However, with time,  I
    got better and collaborated with multiple teams to figure out what I was missing
    and how I could do better if I had to start over.

- en: Complicating your resume with technical terms, too much information, or unconventional
    formats can lead to it being rejected right away. Your resume should be easy to
    read and understand, even by someone not deeply versed in data science. Use a
    clean, professional layout with clear headings, bullet points, and a standard
    font. Avoid dense blocks of text. Remember, the goal is to communicate your skills
    and experiences as quickly and effectively as possible to the hiring manager.

    section, it is recommended to focus on quantifiable achievements rather than simply
    listing your responsibilities.

    write "Developed a machine learning model that increased sales by 15%." This will
    demonstrate the tangible impact of your work and showcase your ability to drive
    results.

- en: When creating a list of your technical skills, it's crucial to highlight the
    ones that are directly relevant to data science. Avoid including skills that are
    not related to data science, such as graphic designing or video editing. Keep
    your list of skills concise, and write the number of years of experience you have
    in each.

    tools like Tableau or Power BI, and data analysis tools like SQL or pandas. Additionally,
    it's worth mentioning your experience with popular machine learning libraries
    such as PyTorch or scikit-learn.

    communication skills are crucial. Including experiences where you worked as part
    of a team, especially in multidisciplinary settings or instances where you communicated
    complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders, can demonstrate your soft
    skills.

    If you have completed internships, projects, or research in data science, be sure
    to highlight these experiences in your resume. Include details about the projects
    you worked on, the tools and technologies you used, and the results you achieved.

    it’s a class assignment, a capstone project, or something you built for fun, include
    projects that demonstrate your skills in data analysis, programming, machine learning,
    and problem-solving. Be sure to describe the project goal, your role, the tools
    and techniques used, and the outcome. Links to GitHub repositories or project
    websites can also add credibility.

    for the role changes. You can demonstrate your adaptability and problem-solving
    skills by highlighting any experiences in which you had to learn a new tool or
    technique quickly, or where you successfully tackled a complex problem.
