- en: It is safe to say proteins are **building blocks** and the machinery which defines living
    matter. In the last 70 years tremendous progress has been made in their isolation,
    production, characterization, and finally engineering. Although great advancements
    in laboratory and industrial-scale protein production have been made, protein
    engineering and all the associated steps remain laborious, expensive and truly complicated.

    which are connected sequentially into long non-branching chains, commonly known

    under different temperatures, pH or salinity. Frequently, researchers are aiming
    at improving catalytic performance of protein enzymes, or adding completely new
    types of chemical activities to known proteins.

- en: The most common and established way to engineer a protein is to create its variants with
    substituted amino acids, also known as mutants. Subsequently, newly produced mutants
    are characterized using various experimental techniques to measure the degree
    of enhancement; e.g. scanning calorimetry, isoelectric point determination, simple
    solubility studies or advanced enzymatic activity assays. However, since there
    are **20 standard** protein amino acids, a complete mutagenesis of 100-residue
    long polypeptide would yield **20^(100)** mutant combinations, should you decide
    to explore all possible combinations of typical protein amino acids.

    consequence of replacing a major part of a protein with a completely new amino
    acid sequence will likely be new fold, hence new functionality. Moreover, I have
    intentionally left out a fundamentally important fact — mutations may significantly
    affect protein dynamics, and thus its function).

    on the size and quality of input data. This argument is especially important for inference and prediction techniques

    methodology are not an exception. However, even with the **relatively sparse** (compared
    to a number of possible combinations of all protein amino acids in lengthy polypeptide
    chains) protein databases, Machine Learning can help to unravel complex, non-linear relationships
    between protein sequences and their structural variability and dynamics. These
    relationships are either very difficult to model or simply not fully understood.

    of proteins is their ability to “**equate**” loosely related protein features to
    measurable experimental data. Thus predictions using complex numerical models
    that underlie Machine Learning methodology, can be further tweaked and refined
    by providing independent experimental proxies of protein structure and dynamics.

    disordering effects of amino acid mutations in engineered proteins can save vast
    amounts of time and resources. An accurate disorder prediction for an arbitrary
    protein mutant can immediately report on problematic combinations of amino acid
    sequences, thus excluding the residues from further mutational analysis and vastly
    reducing the mutation search space.
