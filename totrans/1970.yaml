    several transformations, so much that the data consumed from the destination is
    widely different from the data actually ingested from the source. Data lineage
    provides a comprehensive way to chart the flow of data through the system—from
    the source to the destination—as it undergoes transformations.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data lineage refers to the tracking and visualization of the flow and transformation
    of data as it moves through various stages in a data pipeline or system. It provides
    a detailed understanding of the origin, movement, and transformation of data within
    the organization’s data pipelines—allowing data professionals to trace the data's
    path from its source to its destination.
