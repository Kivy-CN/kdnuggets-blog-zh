- en: Many associate “data science” with self-driving cars, artificial intelligence,
    smart cities and bioinformatics, though it is increasingly part of marketing.
    Marketing data science is multifaceted but at its core is personalized marketing,
    a high-tech extension of [direct marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/direct-marketing.asp).
    Two manifestations of it, personalized ads and recommendations, are now so ubiquitous
    that they often escape our notice.

    are two books that provide excellent overviews of how data science is used in
    marketing. The Data and Marketing Association [website](https://thedma.org/) may
    also be of interest to many readers, and the JM-MSI Special Issue: "[From Marketing
    Priorities to Research Agendas](https://www.ama.org/jm-msi-special-issue-from-marketing-priorities-to-research-agendas/)"
    offers a deep dive from an academic perspective.'

    as economic downturns and technological innovation, not to mention pandemics. [Privacy
    legislation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) as well as the popularity of ad blockers and
    search engines which do not track are having an impact. A "[cookieless future](https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/09/28/navigating-a-cookieless-future/)"
    is already the subject of blogs and articles.

    in the first place. Some maintain it doesn't really work from a technical standpoint,
    that is, that personalized ads and recommendations do not actually reach the right
    people at the right time, or the right people at any time.

- en: Part of this is a data issue. Not a small amount of the “big data” used in digital
    marketing consists of imputed and aggregate data that have been mashed together.
    Marketing scientists and others who analyze and model data know that missing data
    and even small errors in a single data file can wreak havoc on our analytics.
  prefs: []

- en: Of course, this is just one point of view and many will contend that personalized
    marketing is more effective than mass marketing or the macro segmentation most
    familiar to marketing researchers.

    currently practiced is mainly concerned with the What (which includes where, how,
    by whom, and how often) but not the Why. Understanding why consumers behave as
    they do can help marketers predict their future behavior, communicate effectively
    with them, and design products they''ll like. Inferring why they behave as they
    do from what they''ve done in the past is not always straightforward because different
    people may do the same things for different reasons. They might also do different
    things for the same reasons.'

    most often because of its disinfectant properties, and another because it’s easy
    to find where they usually shop. One person might use Goo Gone because they like
    its fragrance, and someone else Citrasolv because they like *its* fragrance.

- en: Another concept sometimes called the multiple me also comes into play. This
    notion reflects the simple fact that consumer behavior often varies according
    to occasion or motivation - buying wine for cooking versus buying wine to celebrate
    a promotion being one illustration. Our behavior can also vary with time due to
    changes in personal circumstances, such as marriage, birth of a child, a promotion
    or relocation. Our tastes may change too.

    would have been made anyway and, in the process, increases price consciousness
    among consumers and, over time, can erode brand equity. Smart marketers, indeed,
    would be wise to avoid encouraging deal shopping. Les Binet and Peter Field have
    much to say worth listening to regarding these topics.

- en: Some maintain that personalized marketing usually works but isn't always cost
    effective. Marketing ROI can be tricky to estimate since some costs are guestimates,
    and adjusting for exogenous factors such as recessions and competitor activity
    is challenging - competitors’ marketing, for example, can actually benefit our
    brand if it helps grow the category.

- en: Moreover, it may appear cost-effective if the investment in data infrastructure
    and analytics teams are ignored. Cost-effectiveness of targeting can also be deceptive
    when we have a higher “hit” rate among a much smaller number of consumers than
    without targeting. Overall sales may actually decline with targeting even when
    marketing ROI is higher.

    Institute, feel targeting as a rule is a bad habit and a bad idea. *How Brands
    Grow* (Sharp), *How Brands Grow: Part 2* (Romaniuk and Sharp), and *Building Distinctive
    Brand Assets* (Romaniuk) in my opinion are must-reads for marketers and marketing
    researchers.'

    which is not trivial and now harder and harder to sweep under the rug. Bob Hoffman
    and Augustine Fou are good sources for more information on this touchy subject.

    are related to marketing and have benefited from having more data, richer data
    and more sophisticated analytics tools. I should also point out that predictive
    analytics and other aspects of personalized marketing can be enhanced by traditional
    marketing research methods such as focus groups and consumer surveys. It’s not
    either/or.
  prefs: []

- en: These “old” methods, which continue to evolve, can be immensely helpful in shedding
    light on the Why. Awareness of this synergy is growing among marketing researchers,
    if not among data scientists, who are often focused on data management and programming.
    I’ve long felt this was an overlooked opportunity for marketing research.

- en: Although I have mostly emphasized threats to marketing data science in this
    article, as a marketing data science person myself my own biases mostly run in
    the opposite direction. However, as a businessperson I cannot afford to believe
    in panaceas or just believe what I wish to believe. Even before the pandemic,
    I sensed growing skepticism in the business community and among investors regarding
    AI and the value of big data - see *Big Data, Big Dupe* (Few) and *laughing@big
    data* (Jones) for examples of what I mean.

    data science headed?" and I'm not sure anyone has. I just try to be careful about
    making assumptions and taking too much for granted.
