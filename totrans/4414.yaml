- en: This heat map shows the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States
    over time. The map is read from left to right, and color coded to show the relative
    numbers of new cases by state, adjusted for population.

- en: This visualization was inspired by a similar heat map that I saw on a discussion
    forum thread. I could never locate the source, as it was only a pasted image with
    no link. The original version was also crafted to make a political point, separating
    states by predominate party affiliation, which I was not as interested in. I was
    fascinated by how it concisely showed the progression of the pandemic, so I decided
    to create a similar visualization myself that I could update regularly.

    If you are just interested in seeing updated versions of this heat map, I publish
    them weekly on my [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/JRBowling). It’s important
    to note that you should be careful comparing graphs from one week to another to
    each other, as the color map may change as new data is included. Comparisons are
    only valid within a given heatmap.

- en: The data comes from the [New York Times COVID-19 Github repo](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
    A simple launcher script clones the latest copy of the repository and copies the
    required file, and then launches the Python script to create the heat map. Only
    one file is really needed, so it could certainly be tightened up, but this works.

- en: The script first loads a CSV file containing the state populations into a dictionary,
    which is used to scale daily new case results. The new cases are computed for
    each day from the running total in the NY Times data, and then [scaled to new
    cases per 100,000 people](https://www.robertniles.com/stats/percap.shtml) in the
    population.

- en: We could display the heat map at that point, but if we do, states with very
    high numbers of cases per 100,000 people will swamp the detail of the states with
    lower numbers of cases. Applying a [log(x+1)](https://onbiostatistics.blogspot.com/2012/05/logx1-data-transformation.html#:~:text=A%3A%20log(x%2B1,in%20which%20x%20was%20measured.) transform
    improves contrast and readability significantly.

    to an image file.

    You can customize it to zero in on areas of interest.
