- en: If you’ve heard of quantum computing, you might be excited about the possibility
    of applying it to machine learning applications. How can you harness this emerging
    technology? I work at Springboard, and we recently launched a machine learning
    bootcamp that includes a job guarantee. We want to make sure our graduates are
    exposed to cutting-edge machine learning applications -- so we put together this
    article as part of our research into the intersection of quantum computing and
    machine learning.

    computing.** In classical computing, your data is stored in physical bits and
    it is binary and mutually exhaustive: a bit is either in a 0 state or in a 1 state
    and it cannot be both at the same time. Quantum computing uses the physical properties
    of smaller-scale physics interactions among molecules so that the quantum bits
    (called “qubits” for short) can be a linear combination of both a classical 0
    and 1 state -- allowing for much more data to be stored in a qubit than in a regular
    bit.'

    with one another, and direct physical observations of the quantum system they
    are placed in (i.e., trying to get classical results from a quantum computer).
    But it can process larger amounts of data faster and reduce space/time considerations
    for many classical computing tasks -- including those related to machine learning.

    which can perform every [full quantum algorithm](http://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/)
    (50 or so of which are described in the preceding link) and quantum annealers,
    which are simplified versions of quantum-capable computers suited to one purpose.

    This article goes in-depth in explaining the differences between [quantum universal
    gate computers and annealers](https://medium.com/quantum-bits/what-s-the-difference-between-quantum-annealing-and-universal-gate-quantum-computers-c5e5099175a1).
    Basically, quantum annealers are “souped-down” versions of universal quantum computers
    that specialize in finding super-local minima and closer approximations to a global
    minima than a classical computer.

- en: Quantum annealers work by having [a series of magnets attached to a grid](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/01/explaining-the-upside-and-downside-of-d-waves-new-quantum-computer/).
    The magnets influence one another and in order for the system as a whole to save
    energy, they will flip into a coordinated orientation that minimizes energy use.
    In a classical setting, the magnets get trapped into low-energy settings before
    being able to find lower minima, but with quantum properties such as tunneling,
    they can skip those large energy cost settings -- which allows for functions to
    more easily descend from a local minima into either a global minima or a closer
    local minima to the global minima.

    descent function being stuck in a sub-optimal setting to one where it is optimal
    or near-optimal, especially on complex non-convex error surfaces.

    if you need a “good enough” answer in a pinch, in a situation that would ordinarily
    require tons of classical computing power. By exploiting quantum tunneling, you
    can more quickly converge to minimizing error functions in optimization applications
    such as portfolio analysis (in finance). This technique has been used to analyze
    the [electrical grid of the United States](https://www.bgp4.com/2018/10/16/annealing-quantum-computers-tackle-big-data-with-a-ml-quantum-boltzmann-machine/),
    with sensors collecting about 3 petabytes of data every two seconds and needing
    quick loss function calculations almost instantly.

    in many high-dimensional spaces. In practice, machine learning requires the use
    of the kernel trick to be able to effectively make calculations. [Quantum computers
    can help make this problem easier](https://hackernoon.com/quantum-machine-learning-d0037f59f31a):
    there are quantum interpretations of the [SVM kernel trick](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-kernel-trick-e0bc6112ef78)
    which can help reduce calculations down to a particular dimension and allow for
    splitting of high-dimensional datasets into more manageable datasets. [This 2016
    paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/18/7/073011/meta)

    dimensionality reduction than any algorithm performed on a classical computer.'

    of your data (conventionally a very hard task, even for smaller datasets) in order
    to streamline distortions in your data and tangibly weigh the risk of data error,
    you could use quantum computing, even at a very small scale, to superior effort
    while using classical computing for the rest of your analysis. This is something
    academics at [MIT, University of Waterloo, and the University of Southern California](https://news.mit.edu/2016/quantum-approach-big-data-0125)
    are actively working on.

    would be too computationally expensive to do so on a classical computer), you
    can quickly get all of the significant features in a dataset, gauge its shape
    and direction and then proceed to do the rest of your work with classical computing
    algorithms, with the features you need in hand and the proper algorithmic approach
