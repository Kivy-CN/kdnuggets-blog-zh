    pipelines. Now I would like to share the knowledge I accumulated in this period
    before it becomes completely obsolete. This article tries to point out the things
    that I would like you to know if you were to become my coworker. These were also
    the things I asked candidates for Big Data Engineer position in my previous company.

    to some of them. It’s important to remember that these answers are very far from

    job is to take the data and make it useful to the business, but also make it in
    a way that will be maintainable in a long term. This broad description covers
    fetching data from various sources (ELK, Splunk, Hadoop, Kafka, Rest Apis, object
    storage and everything else), transforming it and serving to fulfil the business
    needs. He often works closely with data scientists to know how the data pipeline
    should look like, which ML model to use and so on.

    has learned hundreds of APIs and should not have a problem with learning yet another
    one. Still, there are few things worth knowing about it, even without real experience.
