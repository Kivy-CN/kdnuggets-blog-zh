    amount of data gets collected in the form of audio files or text written on social

    You can segment your customers according to their behavior, which makes it possible
    to create customer personas based on the blended data. From there comes the possibility
    of analyzing what the customers did or said and predicting and influencing their
    behavior. This is the level where you know your customers better than they know

    greater confidence. This means offering them the right product at the right time
    and at the right price. Based on your data, you know that you won’t be, for example,
    offering thrillers to someone who enjoys reading philosophy books. But if you

    doing something wrong if you’re acquiring new customers while at the same time
    losing your current customers at a much quicker rate. There’s no growth there!

    defines what a repeated purchase is in terms of the number of purchases and time
    between each purchase. Then you can investigate why some customers stay with you
    and others don’t. If the trend is negative, you can turn it around. If it's positive,
    you can keep doing what you’re doing and improve on this trend.
  id: totrans-50

    focused on the purchase but can reflect customer satisfaction. It could include
    data such as the number of customers following you on social media, liking and
    commenting on your posts, resharing them, reviewing your products or services,
    etc. Is sharing better than liking? Is commenting better than sharing? Is a comment
    positive or negative? Putting value to such information that could mean everything
    and nothing is where data science comes in. For example, by determining the ‘feeling’
    of comment, whether it is highly positive, positive, neutral, negative, or extremely
    negative. You can calibrate machine learning algorithms to that for you. Much
    faster and much more consistent. The algorithm’s worldview isn’t separated into
    before and after a cup of morning coffee.

    or motivation (e.g., some are more motivated by money and some by learning new
    stuff). Tailoring training and development to each individual will result in using
    their potential to the maximum while, at the same time, keeping them happy. You
    can only benefit from a quality and satisfied worker who wants to stay at your
    company.

    an expensive process that takes time. Data science helps in predicting the need
    for the workforce increase. This is the function of your business growth, but
    other forces have to be factored in. Knowing that you’ll need more employees is
    one thing, but knowing the profile of your employees is another thing. What’s
    the situation in the employment market? Are people you need there at all? If they
    are, at what price? Using data science allows you to predict these variables and
    support your growth by hiring the right people at the right time.

    in your head is easy, you approximately know where you are, and you can confidently
    rely on your gut feeling. As you grow, you’ll realize navigating your business
    without any reporting will increasingly start to feel like driving with a blindfold.

    to reports, thus allowing you to make business decisions, becomes crucial. Data
    engineers, database designers and administrators, data analysts, statisticians,
    and BI developers can do wonders for you, given the right tools.

    happened, but you can gaze into the future by starting to predict what will happen,
    what should be done to make something happen (or not), and even finding unknown
    links between datasets and finding out why and how things happen.

    business and, at the same time, didn’t change anything. [Companies](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/11-best-companies-to-work-for-as-a-data-scientist/)
    still need to have products or services and have to sell to survive and grow.
    However, the types of products the business can offer, how they develop them,
    and how they reach their customers are changing completely.

    data doesn’t mean anything unless it’s turned into information and insights. For
    that, you need data scientists. Unsurprisingly, data scientists are for years
    high in demand. Their expertise and an ever-increasing number of data science
    tools can change virtually every aspect of your business: from product design,
    development, testing, and manufacturing, to marketing, pricing, inventory management,
    distribution, hiring, and reporting.'
