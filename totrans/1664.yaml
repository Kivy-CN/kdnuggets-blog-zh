    get back to running, one of my favorite activities. Now, you may be thinking "what
    the heck does this have to do with Data Science?", but during my recovery I found
    more parallels than you might think. I started to make the connection a few months
    into rehab, with all of the squats, icing, balancing drills, and massages. Getting
    back into running shape was so similar to the tasks I had to do on a daily basis
    to build a strong data science culture. Even more, I came to realize that data
    science today is much like preparing for and running a marathon (something few
    do, and even less do well).

  zh: 什么是数据科学？
- en: Data science, surprisingly perhaps, is not about designing the most advanced
    machine learning algorithms and training them on all of the data (and then having
    Skynet). It’s about finding the right data, becoming a quasi-expert on the process,
    system, or event you are trying to model, and crafting features that will help
    quirky and sometimes frail statistical algorithms make accurate predictions. Very
    little time is actually spent on the algorithm itself. Of course, there are exceptions
    to this, but even in those areas most of the research today is done by a few people
    (and/or companies) like Google, Facebook, etc. who are advancing the technical
    aspects of the field. Everyone only starts using the new algorithms after they
    are neatly packaged in open source software. A recent study of industry data scientists
    shows that 79% of their time is spent collecting, organizing, and cleaning data
    (60% cleaning and organizing, and 19% collecting data), empirically [confirming
    that there is a lot of marathon preparation going on](http://visit.crowdflower.com/rs/416-ZBE-142/images/CrowdFlower_DataScienceReport_2016.pdf).
    But when does the actual race start? This presents a very different view of what
    is going on behind the scenes, and points to a possible reason for the delay in
    value mentioned earlier.

    的时间花在数据的收集、整理和清理上（60%用于清理和整理，19%用于收集数据），这在经验上[确认了大量马拉松式的准备工作](http://visit.crowdflower.com/rs/416-ZBE-142/images/CrowdFlower_DataScienceReport_2016.pdf)。但实际比赛何时开始？这提供了对幕后实际情况的不同视角，并指出了前面提到的价值延迟的可能原因。

    and no ability to link data points across the organization, you start to hear
    things like, “oh… You need to talk to Jeff about the sales pipeline data” or “Beth,

    more about the business, inevitably you discover that some critical pieces of
    information are not being tracked or stored. Or even worse, you need to develop
    a way to gather data that previously wasn’t available. This may sound dramatic,
    but this is the reality of the experience of many data scientists when they start
    at a company that's just getting into machine learning. It’s no coincidence that

    Of course, there are industries that can and are benefiting greatly from machine
    learning (think self-driving cars, natural language processing, voice recognition,
    and the like). However, for the vast majority of companies, machine learning is

    and resources within a cloud environment and making them searchable by machines
    **and humans**. It also means figuring out the true actor for events that occur
    in client environments, tracing activities back through chains of “AssumeRole”
    events (If you’re familiar with AWS, you’ll know the pain). Finally, it means
    being able to connect the dots between resources and how they communicate with
    one another, demonstrating dependencies and areas of potential risk.

    from the way we interact with our devices, communicate with one another, and conduct
    business around the world. But when you dissect it a little bit more, you begin
    to see all of the things that enable its success. It may sound blasphemous to
    say, but it’s important for companies to recognize that with some basic statistics
    and meaningful organization of their data, they're already 95% of the way there.
    Machine learning undeniably adds a little extra flair (and accuracy) to the final
