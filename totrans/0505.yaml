    to work from anywhere, choose your clients and only take on projects you love.

    are only so many clients you can serve and projects you can take on. Your income
    is heavily dependent on how many hours you put in.

    and build a data business that is **truly scalable.** Even if you’re an experienced
    data freelancer, these tips will help you pinpoint some of the missing pieces
    that are holding you back from being as profitable as you could be.

    anyway? Well, I’m Lillian Pierson, and I started out as a data science freelancer
    way back in 2012, right after they coined the term ‘data scientist’. From there,
    I started my business Data-Mania, and since then, we’ve supported over 10% of
    Fortune 100 companies with strategic data plans.

    to start their six-figure data businesses and to date, over **10% of my mentorship
    clients have landed six-figure contracts** within the first seven months of signing
    up with me.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I say data freelancers, I’m referring to data professionals who offer data
    services in a freelance capacity. They sell their data skills on the open market
    - whether those are skills in data science, data analytics, data visualization,
    or any other data specialty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some cases, data freelancers may be operating with a team, whether that means
    they have admin and business support or fellow data professionals helping them
    to carry out the data services they provide. The work they carry out is always
    service-based work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, as a data entrepreneur, you're showing up as the CEO and visionary
    behind your business. When it comes to the delivery of the work, particularly
    with services, you are most commonly delegating all, if not at least significant
    portions of that to your team.

    to an administrative assistant. There is no need for you to answer every single
    email that comes into your inbox!

    built processes around the service you provide and you've documented every step
    that needs to be taken, you can actually find virtual assistants or fellow data
    experts to come in and follow the instructions and do the work on your behalf!

    your service. For example, you could check in with them at the 30% mark, 60% mark,

    has been delivered.

    and optimize your processes, you’ll be able to create a business that’s bigger
    than just YOU. You’ll be able to offer data solutions of a much, much larger scale
    - because you’re no longer stuck in the weeds of implementation in your business.
    The more you can automate and delegate, the more you’ll have time to focus on
    becoming the best data CEO you can be.
