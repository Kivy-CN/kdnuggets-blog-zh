- en: Python is an all-time favorite language for programming enthusiasts like me.
    I have a keen interest in this language and have been using it for over 2 years.
    This year I had a lot of spare time to work on my programming skills and developed
    a lot of projects centered on web development, android app, and Data Science.
    In this article, I will explain what was the purpose of each project, how I made
    it, my associated article with that project, and the GitHub repository link. Maybe
    this can seed a similar project idea in your mind too! Let’s explore these projects.

    make it to the final project we showcase on social media/LinkedIn. This GitHub
    action allows you to generate a self-updating portfolio with Projects, Hackathons,
    and the latest Blogs. An index file is generated by this action, which with the
    help of GitHub pages gets deployed as soon as it is committed to the repository.
    The main purpose of this project was to serve as a helping hand in portraying
    the skills you have as projects developed by you.

    of interactivity, but as I received continuous feedback from the community, another
    theme was added to this project. This action is now flexible to choose constraints
    such as whether to add blogs, hackathons, choosing the type of GitHub stats you
    want to display, all are made optional in newer versions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being a Data Science follower, I am always curious about discovering trends
    in Data. I always try to look up real-world scenarios where data can be obtained
    easily, and when I discovered that WhatsApp has the functionality to export group
    chats, I couldn't resist analyzing the Data. I did it for my college group, was
    happy with that, but then got the idea that why not develop a generalized web
    application where anybody can upload their chat file and gather some interesting
    insights! This is exactly what this project does.

    stats generation custom functions, and displays it to the user on the go! The
    file uploaded is deleted as soon as the stats are generated for privacy. This
    web app displays the total emoji count, its usage over the group members, the
    activity of members per day, overall and on designated holidays, and some more
    features too! This is an excellent project for Data cleaning and visualization,
    or you can come up with a prediction model to predict the next chat of the person
    based on this data. There are endless possibilities!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am currently enrolled in college (3rd year) and pursuing my bachelor's from
    India. My university releases the semester exam results in form of long PDF’s
    which are usually cluttered with a lot of irrelevant information for a student.
    Even the subject names are in coded form, and it becomes difficult to calculate
    the credit score obtained. Also, predicting the rank of a candidate manually is
    next to impossible as there are around 6k students in every batch every year.
    To ease this process, I developed a parsing script that reads these long pdfs
    (some are close to 400 pages!), stores them in a readable format, applies all
    the data transformation techniques to obtain grade points, percentage, and ranks
    at college and university-level!

    onwards and there are two semesters in a year here. So I probably have 60k records
    till now! The website also offers a generate profile functionality that pulls
    up all the previous semester's results. This is one of my biggest projects I have
    ever made and took around 2 months for complete satisfaction.

- en: As I was successful in developing the website, it was time to expand this functionality
    to other platforms, and discovered how to make android apps in Python. It was
    possible because of the amazing library called Kivy and the material design of
    Kivymd. The has the ability to make requests to the backend API and displays as
    results in tabular form. It took a lot of time to have a good grasp of this library
    but it was worth it.

- en: I think, I went too far with this results project and made a telegram bot too!
    While developing the first version of the bot, I made a huge mistake to run an
    infinite loop that checks the new message and this process consumes a lot of resources.
    When I deployed it for the first time on Heroku, the very next day I got the mail
    that all my current hours have been consumed and that time I realized that I made
    a huge mistake. To resolve this issue, I adapted the webhook concept of Telegram
    that allows messages to be directly redirected to my link whenever it happens.

- en: Another thing I did was integrating the bot into a flask server which helps
    in preventing the bot to go into an infinite loop! Now every time a person makes
    a result request, it sends it to the sleeping Heroku app, and with this request,
    the app state is changed and results are delivered.

    This is built using Brython that allows you to run Python code on front-end websites
    without any Flask, Django, or any other server. I made a song lyrics fetcher that
    makes an API call based on the artist's name and album passed to the website.
    This was so easy project that I hosted this project on GitHub pages that ensured
    longer uptime and no recurring costs!

- en: While discovering the Kivy & Kivymd library, I discovered that I can deploy
    a machine learning model on android. This was an indirect method as the python-to-android
    doesn't support sklearn for now. I had to deploy the model as an API on Heroku
    and then make GET requests to fetch the predictions and display them on the user
    screen. Though this was a naive approach and many other things could be implemented
    here but this was all I could think of when I build this project.

    article. Making a project is a whole systematic process from idea, to design,
    code and if applicable, deploying it on the internet. I think I provided some
    sort of motivation to you, the readers, to come up with your own ideas and show
    the world your skills.
