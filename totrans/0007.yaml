    significant traction in recent years and rightly so. Such discussions aim to address
    myriad risks, involving bias, misinformation, fairness, etc.

    AI applications has certainly amplified them. Data privacy, a persistent issue,
    has gained increased importance with the emergence of Generative AI.

    information that directly identifies an individual, such as name, address, any
    identifying number or code, telephone number, email address, etc. A more nuanced

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to address this gap is to build internal governance measures, much like
    corporate governance and data governance. It is equivalent to owning up your models
    to the best of your knowledge clubbed with the known industry standards and best
    practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such measures of self-regulation are a very strong indicator of holding high
    standards of integrity and customer-centricity, which can become a differentiator
    in this highly competitive world. Organizations adopting the charter of self-regulation
    can wear it as a badge of honor and gain customers’ trust and loyalty – which
    is a big feat, given the low switch costs for the users among the plethora of
    options floating around.
  prefs: []

    organizations on the path of a responsible AI framework, so they are prepared
    for easy adoption when the legal regulations are put in place.

    organization is fully capable of foreseeing it all and safeguarding themselves.
  prefs: []

    adhering to the same rules. No one would wish to self-sabotage their growth in
    anticipation of upcoming regulation by over-regulating themselves, hindering their
    business growth.

    organizations and their employees. However, the users have an equally important
    role to play – it is time to raise your guard and develop a lens of awareness.

    teams and create awareness of the right ways to prompt the model. For sectors
    like healthcare and finance, any sensitive information shared through input prompts
    is also a form of breach of privacy – this time unknowingly but through the employees
    and not from the model developers.

    to make a multi-million dollar transaction to a certain account. Following the
    skepticism, the employee suggested arranging a call to discuss this, after which
    he made the transaction – only to know later that everyone on the call was deepfakes.

    explains it as – “a video, photo, or audio recording that seems real but has been
    manipulated with AI. The underlying technology can replace faces, manipulate facial
    expressions, synthesize faces, and synthesize speech. Deepfakes can depict someone
    appearing to say or do something that they never said or did.”

    equivalent to identity theft, where the bad actors are pretending to be someone
    they are not.

    way ahead of good actors, who are on defense. Good actors are still scrambling
    their way around to damage control first, as well as ensure robust measures to
    prevent future mishaps.
