- en: One of the arguments that is regularly used in favor of machine learning systems
    is the fact that they can arrive to decisions without being vulnerable to human
    subjectivity. However, that argument is only partially true. While machine learning
    systems don’t make decisions based on feelings or emotions, they do inherit a
    lot of human biases via the training datasets. Bias is relevant because it leads
    to unfairness. In the last few years, there has been a lot of progress developing
    techniques that can mitigate the impact of bias and improve the fairness of machine
    learning systems. Recently, [DeepMind published a research paper that proposes
    using an old statistical technique known as Causal Bayesian Networks(CBN) to build
    more fairer machine learning systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06430).

    often define fairness in terms of subjective criteria. In the context of machine
    learning models, fairness can be represented as the relationships between a sensitive
    attribute( race, gender…) and the output of the model. While directionally correct,
    that definition is incomplete as it is impossible to evaluate fairness without
    considering the data generation strategies for the model. Most fairness definitions
    express properties of the model output with respect to sensitive information,
    without considering the relations among the relevant variables underlying the
    data-generation mechanism. As different relations would require a model to satisfy
    different properties in order to be fair, this could lead to erroneously classify
    as fair/unfair models exhibiting undesirable/legitimate biases. From that perspective,
    identifying unfair paths in the data generation mechanisms is as important as
    understanding the models themselves.

    models is that its characteristics expand beyond technological constructs and
    typically involve sociological concepts. In that sense, visualizing the datasets
    is an essential component to identify potential sources of bias and unfairness.
    From the different frameworks in the market, DeepMind relied on a method called [Causal](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/philosophy/philosophy-science/causality?format=HB) [Bayesian](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c4bc/ad0bb58091ecf9204ddb5db7dce749b0d461.pdf) [networks](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/causation-prediction-and-search-second-edition) (CBNs)
    to represent and estimate unfairness in a dataset.

- en: Causal Bayesian Networks(CBNs) are a statistical technique used to represent
    causality relationships using a graph structure. Conceptually, a CBN is a graph
    formed by nodes representing random variables, connected by links denoting causal
    influence. The novelty of DeepMind’s approach was to use CBNs to model the influence
    of unfairness attributes in a dataset. By defining unfairness as the presence
    of a harmful influence from the sensitive attribute in the graph, CBNs provides
    a simple and intuitive visual representation for describing different possible
    unfairness scenarios underlying a dataset. In addition, CBNs provide us with a
    powerful quantitative toolto measure unfairness in a dataset and to help researchers
    develop techniques for addressing it.

    that represent individual variables linked by causal relationships. In a CBN structure,
    a path from node X to node Z is defined as a sequence of linked nodes starting
    at X and ending at Z. X is acause of (has an influence on) Z if there exists a
    causalpathfrom X to Z, namely a path whose links are pointing from the preceding
    nodes toward the following nodes in the sequence.

    One of the most famous studies in bias and unfairness in statistics was published
    in 1975 by a group of researchers at Berkeley University. The study is based on
    the college admission scenario in which applicants are admitted based on qualifications
    Q, choice of department D, and gender G; and in which female applicants apply
    more often to certain departments (for simplicity’s sake, we consider gender as
    binary, but this is not a necessary restriction imposed by the framework). Modeling
    that scenario as a CBN we have the following structure. In that graph, the path
    G→D→A is causal, whilst the path G→D→A←Q is non causal.

    Our college admission example showed a clear example about how unfair relationships
    can be modeled as paths in a CBN. However, while a CBN can clearly measure unfairness
    in direct paths, the indirect causal relationships are highly dependent on contextual
    factors. For instance, consider the three following variations of our college
    in which we can evaluate unfairness. In these examples total or partial red paths
    are used to indicate unfair and partially-unfair links, respectively.

    apply to departments with low acceptance rates, and therefore the path G→D is
    considered fair.

    apply to departments with low acceptance rates due to systemic historical or cultural
    pressures, and therefore the path G→D is considered unfair (as a consequence,
    the path D→A becomes partially unfair).

    admission rates for departments voluntarily chosen more often by women? Well,
    the path G→D is considered fair, but the path D→A is partially unfair.

    unfairness scenarios. However, the interpretation of the influence of unfair relationships
    is often dependent on contextual factors outside the CBN.

- en: Until now, we have used CBNs to identify unfair relationships in a dataset but
    what if we could measure them? It turns out that a small variation of our technique
    can be used to quantify unfairness in a dataset and to explore methods to alleviate
    it. The main idea to quantify unfairness relies on introducing counterfactual
    scenarios that allow us to ask if a specific input to the model was treated unfairly.
    In our scenario, a counterfactual model would allow to ask whether a rejected
    female applicant (G=1, Q=q, D=d, A=0) would have obtained the same decision in
    a counterfactual world in which her gender were male along the direct path G→A.
    In this simple example, assuming that the admission decision is obtained as the
    deterministic function f of G, Q, and D, i.e., A = f(G, Q, D), this corresponds
    to asking if f(G=0, Q=q, D=d) = 0, namely if a male applicant with the same department
    choice and qualifications would have also been rejected.

    the importance of creating fair models will become more relevant. The DeepMind
    paper shows that CBNs can offer a visual framework for detecting unfairness in
    a machine learning model as well as a model for quantifying its influence. This
    type of technique could help us to design machine learning models that represent
    the best of human values and that mitigate some of our biases.
