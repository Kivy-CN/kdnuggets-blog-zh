    project tutorials. I''ll follow the steps that the author had outlined. But, sometimes,
    my model would perform worse than the tutorial author’s model. Maybe you’ve been
    in a similar situation, too. Or perhaps, you just pulled your colleague’s code
    from GitHub. And your model’s performance metrics are different from those that
    your colleague’s report claims. *So doing the same thing doesn’t guarantee the
    same results, yes?* This is a prevalent problem in machine learning: the challenge
    of **reproducibility**.'

    the result in each of those runs.

    a breeze. However, dependency management in Python—managing the different libraries
    and versions required for a given project—is a non trivial challenge. A small
    change such as using a different version of the library and a function call using
    a deprecated argument is enough to break the code.

    networks – randomness plays an important role in machine learning.

    model that we train, there is a set of hyperparameters. So tweaking one or more
    of the hyper parameters can also lead to different results.

    values and randomness can make it difficult to replicate the results. Therefore,
    it's obvious that, when the data changes—a change in the data distribution, modifications
    to a subset of records, or dropping of some samples—make it difficult to reproduce
    the results.
