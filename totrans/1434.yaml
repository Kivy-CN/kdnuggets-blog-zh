    for one from academic partners. As a group, we have spent the vast majority of
    our time in industry, although many of us have had spent time in one academic
    capacity or another. What follows is a set of broad recommendations, and it will
    inevitably require a lot of adjustments in each implementation. Given that caveat,
    here are our curriculum recommendations.

- en: We want to lead by emphasizing that the single most important factor in preparing
    students to apply their knowledge in an industry setting is application-centric
    learning. Working with realistic data to answer realistic questions is their best
    preparation. It grounds abstract concepts in hands-on experience, and it teaches
    data mechanics and data intuition at the same time, something that is impossible
    to do in isolation.

    to practice data science.

- en: The types of data science and data-centric academic programs closely mirror [the
    major skill areas](https://github.com/brohrer/academic_advisory/blob/master/what_DS_do.md) we
    have identified in our work. There are programs that emphasize **engineering**,
    programs that emphasize **analytics**, and programs that emphasize **modeling**.
    The distinction between these is that analytics focuses on the question of what
    can we learn from our data, modeling focuses on the problem of estimating data
    we wish we had, and engineering focuses on how to make it all run faster, more
    efficiently, and more robustly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also **general data science programs** that cover all these areas
    to some degree. In addition there are quite a few **domain specific programs**,
    where a subset of engineering, analytics, and modeling skills specific to a given
    field are taught.

- en: The curriculum recommendations for each of these program archetypes will be
    different. However, all of them will share some core topics. Then analytics, engineering,
    and modeling-centric programs will have additional topic areas of their own. A
    general curriculum will include some aspects of the analytics, engineering, and
    modeling curricula, although perhaps not to the same depth. It is common for students
    to self-select courses from any combination of the three areas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Curricula for domain specific programs look similar to a general program, except
    that topics, and even entire courses, will be focused on specific skills common
    to the area. For instance, an actuarial-focused data analytics program would likely
    include software tools most commonly used in insurance companies, time series
    and rare-event prediction algorithms, and visualization methods that are accepted
    throughout the insurance industry. The student can best practice their skills
    through a project based on real domain-specific data. Hands-on projects or internships
    are highly recommended. When designing the programs, institutions may also consider
    offering interdisciplinary degrees and programs. Domain specific programs often
    combine courses from multiple departments or colleges.

- en: Note that for each topic and subtopic, there are many effective ways to split
    it into courses. The best way for your institution will depend on many factors,
    including length of term, hours per class, existing departmental boundaries, instructor
    availability, and the rate at which your students are expected to absorb information.
    These recommendations assume a two-year masters program with the primary goal
    of preparing students for employment and continued career growth, although they
    can certainly be scaled up or down to fit the scope of other programs.

    students for professional positions. The more theory is grounded in concrete examples,
    and the more specific skills are exercised in the context of solving a larger
    problem, the deeper the student's understanding of how it works, and where to
    apply it.
