- en: Cloud notebooks have become the norm these days for data scientists and analysts
    to run their code and generate analytical reports. Cloud notebooks provide a browser-based
    interface to write and execute code without the need to install anything locally.
    Additionally, high-end hardware is accessible for accelerating machine learning
    research and development.

    this year. For example, they are adding new high-tier GPUs, scheduling runs, dedicated
    tabs for models, and quickly loading the dataset. The only thing they need to
    catch up on is live collaboration and commenting.
  prefs: []

    option for your data science and analytics tasks. It provides a similar feature
    to Deepnote, but due to slow environment loading and code running. I have ranked
    it at third. It is also limited in many ways.'

- en: Hex is a modern Data Workspace that aims to make working with data easier and
    more collaborative. It allows users to connect to a variety of data sources, including
    databases, cloud storage, and APIs. Once the data is connected, users can analyze
    it using either SQL or Python directly within interactive notebooks.

    plugin. Before that, I had no idea it existed. It is simple, fast, and comes with
    all kinds of features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This platform provides data connection, loading, versioning, publishing of notebooks,
    live collaboration, and fast environment loading. The best part about this platform
    is its minimalist design. Additionally, you can connect it with ChatGPT to generate
    and run code with outputs. This feature makes it highly valuable in the notebook
    category.

    that we love and cherish. We use them to run our deep learning code, and sometimes
    it is an excellent and convenient tool. Things have changed over the years as
    they limit the free tier and focus on paid options.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but it is slow and lacks some key features. You are also limited by computing.
    I used to run my code on Datalore, but since its launch, there haven''t been much
    improvement or changes to the platform. It seems like JetBrains have forgotten
    about it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    any beginner to get used to it. The only good part is that it provides free storage
    and computing.

- en: In conclusion, cloud notebooks have become essential tools for data scientists
    and analysts to efficiently carry out their work. The top options provide great
    value with free GPUs, easy setup, collaboration features, and integrations with
    other services. Deepnote stands out as the most full-featured option, with its
    fast environment loading, AI assistance, live collaboration, and publishing capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kaggle is great for working with deep learning given its high-tier hardware
    access. Hex and Noteable offer modern interfaces and integrations like ChatGPT.
    While Google Colab and others have their niche uses, Deepnote seems to be leading
    the pack with its focus on the end-to-end data science workflow. Whichever platform
    you choose, cloud notebooks will undoubtedly enhance your data science projects
    and ability to derive insights.
