    attacks and data breaches are a significant cause for concern for individuals
    and organizations. Ransomware, phishing, and malicious insiders are examples of
    how corporate data can be exposed to threats. To mitigate the impact of these
    threats, businesses invest in emerging technologies based on the advances of Artificial
    Intelligence.

- en: To understand how bad the problem is with data breaches, it is helpful to look
    at the key findings of the latest [Verizon 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/).
    According to the report, 74% of the reported breaches involved the human element,
    while external, financially motivated actors were responsible for 83% of the incidents
    – which means insiders, both malevolent and unintentional, were responsible for
    the rest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of the reported breaches, 24% were caused due to a ransomware attack, while
    Business Email Compromise (BEC) frauds were responsible for half of the reported
    phishing attacks. When data was breached, the top three categories were personal
    data, login credentials, and internal corporate information like intellectual
    property and strategic business plans.

    burden on businesses is enormous; the [average data breach cost was $4.35 million
    in 2022](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach), indicating a cumulative increase
    of 12.7% compared to 2020\. The most affected sectors were healthcare, finance,
    pharmaceuticals, energy, and other critical businesses.

    (AI) tools, like generative AI or large language models (LLM), to [craft sophisticated

    have detrimental effects on businesses, it can become a savior in the right hands.
    AI technology utilizes algorithms to analyze data and identify patterns that may

- en: Using AI to identify and prevent threats and data breaches benefits organizations
    in many ways. First, AI enables security teams to respond swiftly to potential
    risks to corporate data. These systems continually scan networks and monitor user
    behavior, alerting the team in real-time of any suspicious activity, increasing,
    thus, the likelihood of stopping an attack before any data is compromised or stolen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, AI provides a more efficient approach to threat response by automating
    mundane tasks such as malware scanning and identifying malicious URLs. This allows
    security teams to focus on more critical areas that require greater attention.
    Eliminating manual jobs from their workflows enables teams to be more effective
    in detecting and preventing attacks against data, ultimately reducing the number
    of data breaches and their impact on the organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, AI can help reduce security costs by minimizing the need for manual
    labor. By detecting threats early on, these systems can mitigate the damage caused
    by malicious attacks and reduce the damage caused by data breaches. The [IBM Cost
    of Data Breach report](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach) highlights that
    the sooner a breach is mitigated, the less the overall cost to the affected organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, AI can assist security teams in averting future attacks by identifying
    patterns in data indicative of a potential attack. By learning from past incidents,
    AI algorithms can help security teams take adequate proactive measures to harden
    the security of corporate and sensitive data and prevent attacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, organizations should also be aware of certain limitations inherent
    in AI systems. For example, AI security tools require considerable data to be
    adequately trained and provide accurate detections and alerts. Otherwise, AI systems
    can become the source of false positives or may miss specific threats, putting
    increased pressure on security teams and damaging the security posture. Additionally,
    training the AI algorithms should be a continuous effort for them to stay effective
    as the threat landscape changes.

    Investing in AI for data security and overall business cybersecurity is a wise
    decision, as it can provide enhanced protection against malicious activity and
    decrease the chances of data breaches and other cyberattacks. However, just like
    generative AI cannot replace human creativity, AI security tools cannot (yet)
    substitute human involvement in cybersecurity.
