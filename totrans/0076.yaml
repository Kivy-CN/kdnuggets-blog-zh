- en: The generative AI revolution has captured the tech world's imagination. ChatGPT
    and tools like it seem to herald a new era of possibility, where AI can generate
    content, art, and even programming code on demand. Venture capital has flooded
    into generative startups, with total funding reaching hundreds of billions dollars.
    But amidst the excitement, some are beginning to wonder - is this a bubble ready
    to pop?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pattern seems familiar. A hot new technology arrives and is immediately
    embraced as world-changing and transformative. Massive amounts of capital pour
    in, valuations hit the stratosphere, and hype overwhelms rational analysis. This
    was the dot-com bubble in the late 90s, where internet startups with no revenue
    or business models achieved dizzying market caps. And it all came crashing down
    in 2000.

- en: The dot-com bubble, also known as the Internet bubble, was a period of excessive
    speculation and investment in internet-based companies during the late 1990s.
    This economic euphoria was driven by the belief in the transformative potential
    of the internet. However, the bubble eventually burst, leading to a crash in stock
    prices and the collapse of many startups.

- en: Many dot-com companies were built on flimsy business models. They lacked solid
    revenue streams or profitability, relying heavily on investor funding. The focus
    was often on capturing market share and user growth rather than generating profits.

- en: As the dot-com companies struggled to turn a profit, reality struck. The initial
    excitement and optimism began to fade as it became clear that many of these companies
    were not sustainable in the long run. Investors started to question the viability
    of these businesses.

- en: The dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s. The stock prices experienced a
    significant drop, leading to the bankruptcy of numerous dot-com companies. The
    NASDAQ index, which had reached its peak in March 2000, dropped 76.81% by October
    of the same year . Big firms like Cisco, Intel, and Oracle lost more than 80%
    of their share value - [Dot-com bubble - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rapid growth and hype surrounding generative AI has all the makings of an
    economic bubble. Generative AI models like DALL-E 2 and GPT-4 have captured the
    public imagination and attracted billions in investment. But this enthusiasm may
    prove unsustainable.
  prefs: []

- en: Like all bubbles, the Generative AI craze is built on speculative expectations
    about future capabilities. Investors are betting these technologies will continue
    rapid advancements and find lucrative real-world applications. But there is a
    risk these expectations get ahead of reality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Several factors could burst the bubble. One is the limitations of today's Generative
    AI. While impressive, the models still produce low-quality outputs too unreliable
    for many tasks. And training ever-larger models requires exponentially more data
    and computing power, raising questions about scalability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As hype meets reality, valuations of generative startups may prove unrealistic.
    Funding could dry up amidst unmet milestones, lack of profits, and loss of novelty.
    Stock prices will likely plunge once growth stalls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Past experience shows hot new technologies go through a hype cycle before real
    capabilities emerge. While Generative AI has promise, investors should beware
    of irrational exuberance. Sustainable value will require matching capabilities
    to appropriate use cases rather than treating it as a cure-all.

    will persist. The mass adoption of Generative AI is still in its relative infancy,
    despite the huge number of companies that have already utilized the technology.
    As more companies take up Generative AI, fears may actually worsen. If an AI bubble
    does occur, it will be because of the following reasons.

- en: There are already signs of a slowdown in the adoption of Generative AI. People
    are starting to prefer creative work from humans rather than relying solely on
    AI-generated content. This preference for human creativity could hinder the growth
    and widespread adoption of Generative AI.
