- en: We have recently shared introductory courses from Amazon's recently-launched
    [Machine Learning University](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/machine-learning-course-free-online-from-amazon-machine-learning-university)
    initiative, courses focusing on both [computer vision](/2020/09/accelerated-computer-vision-free-course-amazon.html)
    (CV) and [natural language processing](/2020/08/accelerated-nlp-free-amazon-machine-learning-university.html)
    (NLP). These courses assume no previous knowledge of the topics, and are based
    on short video lectures and corresponding Python notebooks.

    NLP? What if you would like to gain an understanding of applying machine learning
    to more traditional datasets? If this remark resembles you, **[Accelerated Tabular
    Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj-sPC6pai4&list=PL8P_Z6C4GcuVQZCYf_ZnMoIWLLKGx9Mi2)**
    from Amazon's Machine Learning University might be a good place to start.

    while the accompanying materials — including slides, notebooks, and datasets —
    can be found in the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-tab).
    The [final project](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-tab/blob/master/notebooks/MLA-TAB-Lecture1-Final-Project.ipynb),
    keeping with the course's goals of emphasizing practical skills, is based on pet
    adoption data from Austin Animal Center.

- en: Why even mention "tabular data"? That's because the course is not designed to
    teach the theory behind the latest state of the art deep learning, but Accelerated
    Tabular Data will give you an introduction to using a variety of techniques to
    implement machine learning solutions on tabular data — that is, data which is
    stored alphanumerically in rows and columns, with rows representing observations,
    and columns representing features of these observations. This contrasts with techniques
    for other types of data, namely computer vision and natural language processing,
    the learning of which complementary courses from Amazon MLU can build upon.

    with practical machine learning. See the course topics above, and think of it
    as a sampler of what is out there, and what you could choose to focus on afterwards.

- en: You won't be engineering production-ready machine learning systems after this
    introductory course, but it should provide you with a survey of what you could
    accomplish practically with machine learning, give you the necessary tools to
    cover some of these tasks, and help point you in a direction of more in-depth
    learning when complete. All in all, this course looks like a good place for some
    to consider starting their machine learning path.
