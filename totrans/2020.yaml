    for ten years in desktop development, backend (mainly Java), and a little bit
    of frontend. Despite my strong IT experience, it wasn't easy at first to figure
    out what data engineers do, how they differ from database administrators, how
    they're connected to data analytics, and what they have to do with Big Data.
