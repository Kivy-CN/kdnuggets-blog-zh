    costs to developing targeted marketing campaigns. Data science is involved in
    practically every step of the process, and professionals who work in data science
    can learn many things from the film industry.

    companies, including Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix, analyze patterns in big data to
    determine the types of content they create and make personalized viewing recommendations.
    In this way, [data science can aid the art of producing and marketing entertainment](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/04/data-science-entertainment-netflix.html)

    of films. The stories of real-life innovators such as Alan Turing and John Nash
    have been turned into major films in recent years, living alongside fictionalized
    tales that use predictive analysis, machine learning, and AI as central plot themes.

    films on the subject are sure to come. Further, production companies will continue
    to use the technology to better understand individual viewing habits and preferences
    to create content that appeals to the masses.

    In 2018, 20th Century Fox, which was acquired by the Walt Disney Company this
    year, released a paper outlining [how it analyzes the content of movie trailers](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18055514/fox-google-ai-analyze-movie-trailer-predict-success-logan)

    to create Merlin, an “experimental movie attendance prediction and recommendation
    system.” In Merlin’s trial run, the tool analyzed the trailer of “Logan,” an origin
    story of the superhero Wolverine, to predict other movies that “Logan” viewers
    might be interested in. Of the 20 predicted, [11 were correct](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/how-20th-century-fox-uses-ml-to-predict-a-movie-audience).

    future software development must include time-saving measures designed to reduce

    used to turn data analytics into useful insight and profit. Big data is often
    externally sourced, using information drawn from the internet, public data sources,
    and more to make more accurate predictions. In the entertainment industry, big
    data can be used to provide a personalized user experience and reduce churn rates
    among streaming site audiences.

    from, retaining viewers is of paramount importance to streaming services and film
    production companies. A high churn rate indicates that a company is doing something
    wrong, and when combined with machine learning, [big data can help companies identify
    problem areas](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/05/churn-prediction-machine-learning.html).

    retention. If viewer recommendations are inaccurate, for example, it could lead
    that viewer to turn to other platforms for entertainment. Streaming services are
    well aware of the importance of a positive user experience.

    [adaptive streaming algorithms](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/using-machine-learning-to-improve-streaming-quality-at-netflix-9651263ef09f)
    to optimize streaming quality and create a personalized user experience. The streaming
    giant adjusts the audio and visual quality of the media to optimize the experience.
    They also use predictive caching to allow a video to play faster or at a higher
    quality. For example, if a viewer is watching a series, the next episode will
    be partially cached.

    “Explicit data is what you literally tell us: you give a thumbs up to The Crown,

    Wired](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-do-netflixs-algorithms-work-machine-learning-helps-to-predict-what-viewers-will-like).
    "Implicit data is really behavioural data. You didn’t explicitly tell us ''I liked
    Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt'', you just binged on it and watched it in two nights,
    so we understand that behaviourally. The majority of useful data is implicit."'

    wide-reaching, but a larger subset of data is needed to find accurate patterns.
    Over the last several decades, researchers have collected data on thousands of
    movies and television shows in search of [viable predictive indicators](https://www.datavisitor.com/how-data-analytics-help-movie-success-prediction/).

    from numerous sources, such as social media and critical reviews. The buzz surrounding
    a film is only a small piece of the larger analytical picture, however. Data analytics
    must be used at every life cycle stage of the movie, from development to post-production
    and distribution.

    Data scientists should take note of the myriad ways that the film industry utilizes
    predictive analysis and big data and bring that knowledge to other industries
    and business settings.
