    field of work: You can''t get a job without experience, but you can''t get experience
    without a job. I''ve recently had this problem when I changed from R to Python
    and was aiming for a Python job, and I want to share how I overcame that problem.'

- en: First, you have to get good at the basics, and you have to do that by yourself.
    Find a good course, or ask about recommendations for a good course, follow it,
    and every time you get stuck, go to [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com)
    and ask your question. You might get impolite responses in the beginning, but
    don't get discouraged - you have to learn how to ask questions there. This teaches
    you to formulate your thoughts and problems clearly to people that are "not in
    your head" - asking good questions is an essential skill that'll be with you for
    the rest of your career.

    when I started learning about big data technologies, I signed up for Cloudera’s
    Spark and Hadoop developer exam. Some professionals don’t like certificates and
    swear on practical work experience, but I consider them very helpful especially
    in the beginning, as a goal, an orientation on what to learn and when to mark
    this first step as “done”.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people stay stuck in step 1 - this is a dangerous trap. Instead, try to
    move away from courses as quickly as possible and create some project you're passionate
    about. Courses can teach you the basics, but they're usually not very good at
    actually motivating you. But if you're stuck in something that's dear to you,
    you'll solve the problem much faster and thus learn faster.

    read blogs, and expand your knowledge of what's already "out there". This could
    very well take some time, but it's an effort that's well worth it. Of course,
    you should also orient the technologies used towards the kind of job you're aiming
    at.

    will. I'm sure mine did. And those of the "big guys" out there probably did, too.
    The only way to make that third really cool project is to make the first two projects
    as well. These first two are the ones where most of your learning happens.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After two or three personal projects, think about contributing to existing larger
    open-source projects. Contributing your code to those projects is the only way
    to get feedback from the very smartest people. They rarely if ever do one-on-one
    tutoring. This is the best way to keep learning, but it takes a while to be able
    to work at that level.

- en: Add your projects and talks to your LinkedIn and/or Github profile, and demonstrate
    why your projects are useful. You have to find out who will be reading your profile.
    For recruiters, just mention the project as if it was a "normal" job. For domain
    experts, just state that it was an unpaid project, but link to your GitHub repository
    and maybe mention how many stars it got.

    to start and finish a project, and can collaborate well in a team. This solves
    the chicken-and-egg problem mentioned in the beginning.
