    in Machine Learning and Data Science, expounded on his excellent book, [**"The
    Master Algorithm"**](/2015/09/book-master-algorithm-pedro-domingos.html) where
    he explained the approaches of 5 tribes of Machine Learning: symbolists, Connectionists,
    Evolutionaries, Bayesians, and Analogizers, and how those methods can be combined
    in search of the master algorithm for Machine Learning that will revolutionize
    our world.'

    but my role as a moderator turned out unexpectedly intense, when lots of questions
    - which I had to read and quickly prioritize - started coming in after only a
    few minutes.

    worlds, and the "no free lunch" theorem is about the latter. Also, the Master
    Algorithm doesn''t just have data as input; it also inputs knowledge (e.g., logic

    the piece that is still missing is perception, or more specifically learning to
    structure and prepare the inputs to these five paradigms. Any thoughts about this?
    Do you consider it to already be part of one or more of these paradigms?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to be solved. For example, the main claim of deep learning is that it learns its
