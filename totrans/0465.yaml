  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'ML engineering and data science are not the same things, and here’s why: you
    know when people say that data science is a mix between business knowledge, statistics,
    and computer science? Well, ML engineering is a lot more about computer science
    and less about statistics and business knowledge.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, that means that a data scientist is more talented at creating new models, analysing and interpreting data,
    and understanding the mathematical basis for those models. He or she will usually
    come from a statistics background, some might have a PhD, and will be really good
    at math, while programming was something they learned in order to do math using
    a computer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An ML engineer, on the other hand, will shine at building and optimising data flows,
    implementing models, and putting them in production. He or she will come from
    a computer science background, might have less formal education than data scientists,
    and will be good at programming and understanding cloud infrastructures, for instance.
    ML engineers, however, are not the same things as data engineers since they also
    need to be very good at tuning models (especially neural networks), understanding cross-validation,
    and feature engineering, for instance. Overall, they should be better than data
    scientists at data infrastructure and better than data engineers at machine learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are still not convinced ML engineering is a real thing, take a look at
    the Google Cloud Platform’s Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification [curriculum](https://cloud.google.com/training?skip_cache=true).
    It doesn’t have much to do with traditional data science curriculums, and it touches
    only the very basics of statistics, but it also doesn’t go deep into the rules
    for choosing databases, for instance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OK, and why one over the other? Well, it’s not one over the other. They both
    have their places in the data ecosystem. But one is starting to become saturated,
    while the other hasn’t even begun to get known. Not many people actually talk
    about ML engineering — at least compared to the amount of people talking about
    data science — and yet I believe the demand for ML engineers might surpass the
    one for data scientists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can see the amount of data scientists soaring all over the world, within
    companies of all sizes, while most of these people aren’t actually doing data
    science at all, just analytics. And many of those who are actually doing data
    science probably didn’t have to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means many organisations are hiring people to solve basically the same
    types of problems, over and over again, in parallel. There is just a lot of redundancy,
    and the quality of the people doing it varies substantially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, we see companies like Google and Amazon, who have some of
    the best data scientists in the world, working on “ready-to-use” ML systems on
    their cloud platforms (GCP and AWS, respectively). This means you can plug your
    data into their systems to benefit from all that knowledge, and all you need is
    someone who knows how to make that connection and the necessary tuning--someone
    like an ML engineer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To put it another way, if data science is not the core of a business, it is
    very unlikely that your data problem is completely novel, so it is more efficient
    to profit from the accumulated knowledge you can access from those cloud providers.
    More often than not, companies are working on the same kind of problems everywhere:
    sales forecasting, customer segmentation, scoring, recommendation, etc. These
    problems have been solved long ago by these tech titans, and you should probably
    profit from transfer learning instead of trying to solve them from scratch.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'That is exactly where ML engineering comes in: you don’t need a PhD in statistics
    or mathematics to benefit from these platforms and adapt them to your needs. A
    very basic understanding of how algorithms work, how hyperparameters affect them,
    and how your data should be processed will do. You do need, however, to be able
    to choose which tools are right for your problem and what the most efficient settings are
    in terms of time and money.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course not. Data scientists will still be needed by many companies to solve
    new or more complex problems. But once the hype is over, there will be fewer “data
    scientists” making the work of data analysts or reinventing the wheel for problems
    that can be solved easily with pre-made solutions.

    crucial over the next few years, you are probably wondering how you can learn
    some of that.

    reality.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have probably used the command line for simple stuff, such as downloading
    Python packages, but you should get a little better at it. In order to use platforms
    like GCP and AWS, this will come in handy. [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) has
    some good courses on the subject.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although we tend to learn data science using Pandas, Spark will come in handy
    when you have too much data and need to run your algorithms in parallel. I think
    the most used version of Spark is Scala, but if you are more familiar with Python,
    learn PySpark instead.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main three cloud providers are AWS, GCP, and Azure, but I advise you to
    choose one and stick to it. I can’t say which one is better, although my personal
    choice was GCP. Before choosing, try finding comparisons of them online--there
    are many. You can also look at the most used one in your country or the one your
    company uses. For now, no matter which one you choose, you will find companies
    that use it and that are looking for people with these specific skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyway, once you have chosen your platform, get really good at it. I mean, REALLY good.
    There is a lot you can do with those platforms, so focus on what you need for
    ML. Looking at the syllabus for their ML certifications will give you a very good
    overview of what to learn. You can access those here: [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/training?skip_cache=true), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/),
    Azure ([DS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-scientist/) or [AI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/)).
    If you want a study guide for the GCP one, I [wrote one](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-passed-the-gcp-professional-ml-engineer-certification-47104f40bec5).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you already work at a company that uses one of those on a regular basis,
    try getting the certification and then get to work on projects that involve it,
    so you get to practice. If your company doesn’t use one of those, the certification
    might help you get a position at another company that does. Either way: study,
    get the certificate, work on it. I can’t stress enough the importance of mastering
    one of these tools.

    I wrote an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-engineering-3a380ad1aa36) going
    through some of the techniques you can use, so make sure you read it and then
    try to implement some of those in your work. To dig a bit deeper, there’s also
    this [great book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/feature-engineering-for/9781491953235/) on
    the subject, which I highly recommend.

    making data **pipelines **run smoothly and fast, etc. In order to put together
    everything else we have seen in this article, you have to study ML engineering
    itself. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=04-CourseraPlus-EU&utm_content=04-CourseraPlus-EU&campaignid=13520447723&adgroupid=124369969820&device=c&keyword=coursera&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=527622276216&hide_mobile_promo=&gclid=CjwKCAjwhuCKBhADEiwA1HegOTgtGdfsh7qAhahSRnaTEk3YA_PGDenUaXB88YoKQOP3Xlyh5Y-D9RoCenAQAvD_BwE#courses) has
    a course on the subject. Although I still haven’t taken it, it was created by
    Andrew Ng and, given his track record, I would be surprised if this course were
    not great.
