    state-of-the-art technologies, or explore the mesmerizing depth of a new technique.
    However, AI or data science is not only bragging about new exciting methods that
    boost accuracy by 2% (which is a big gain) but about making data and technology
    work for you. It will help you increase sales, understand your customers, predict
    future faults in process lines, or make an insightful presentation, submit a term
    project, or have a good time with your friends working on a new idea that will
    change the world. And in this sense, everyone can — and to some extent should
    — become a data scientist.

    what you should learn before you set to a real project. In this post, we’ll walk
    you through the process of building a backbone data project in simple steps.

    were a child about having a toys-cleaning robot or the one that just came into
    your mind about accessing the customers in your shop by sending them fortune cookies
    with predictions based on their purchase preferences. However, to make your idea
    work, you need the attention of others. Find a compelling narrative for it; make
    sure that it has a hook or a captivating purpose, that it is up-to-date and relevant.
    Finding the narrative structure will help you decide whether you actually have
    a story to tell.

- en: The first practical step is collecting data to fuel your project. Depending
    on your field and goals, you can search for ready datasets available on the Internet,
    such as for example, this [collection](https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/).
    You can choose to scrape data from websites or access data from social networks
    through public API’s. For the latter option, you need to write a small program
    that can download data from social networks in a programming language you feel
    the most comfortable with. For the cloud option, you can spin up a simple [AWS
    EC2 Linux instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) (nano
    or micro), and run your software on in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best way to store the data is to use a simple .csv format with each line,
    including the text and meta information, such as the person, timestamp, replies,
    and likes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As to the amount of data needed, the rule of the thumb is to get as much data
    as possible in a reasonable time, for example, a few days of running your program.
    Another important consideration is to collect as much data as the machine you
    are using for analytics can handle. How much data to get is not an exact science,
    but it rather depends on the technical limitations and the question you have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, in collecting and managing data, it is crucial to be [devoid of bias](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html?_r=0) and
    do not be selective about the inclusion or exclusion of data. This selectivity
    includes using discrete values when the data is continuous; how you deal with
    missing, outlier, and out of range values; arbitrary temporal ranges; capped values,
    volumes, ranges, and intervals. Even if it is arguing to influence, it should
    be based upon what the data says–not what you want it to say.

    the data, you need to select the proper tool to explore it. To make a choice,
    you can write down a list of analytics features you think you need and compare
    available tools. Sometimes you can use user-friendly graphical tools like Orange,
    Rapid Miner, or Knime. In other cases, you’ll have to write the analysis on your
    own with such languages as Python or R.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the data and tools available, you can prove your theory. In Data Science,
    theories are statements of how the world should be or is and are derived from
    axioms that are assumptions about the world, or precedent theories ([Das, 2013](https://srdas.github.io/Papers/DSA_Book.pdf)).
    Models are implementations of the theory; in data science, they are often algorithms
    based on theories that are run on data. The results of running a model lead to
    a deeper understanding of the world based on theory, model, and data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To assess your theory at an initial step, in line with the more general and
    conventional content analysis, you can pinpoint trends present in the data. One
    way we use quite a lot is to select significant events that have been reported.
    Then you can try to create an analytics process that finds these trends. If analytics
    can find the trends you specified, then you are on the right track. Look for instances
    where analytics finds new trends. Confirm these trends, for instance, by searching
    the Internet. The results are not going to be reliable 100% of the time, so you’ll
    need to decide how many falsely reported trends (the error rate) you want to tolerate.

    first version of your product, the so-called minimum viable product (MVP). Basically,
    this can be the first version that you offer to customers. As a minimum viable
    product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers
    and to provide feedback for future development, it should focus only on the core
    functionality without any fancy solutions. You should stick to simple functions
    that will work in the beginning and expand your system later. At this stage, the
    system could look something like this:'

    to S3, starting the analysis or data storing. In [this article](https://medium.com/sciforce/automation-in-it-31550abbda41), we
    discussed automation in more detail.'
  prefs: []

- en: The other face of automation is logging. When everything is automated, you can
    feel that you are losing control over your system and do not know how it performs.
    Besides, you need to know what to develop next, both in terms of new features
    and fixing problems. For this, you need to set up a system for logging, monitoring,
    and measuring all meaningful data. For instance, you should log statistics for
    the download of your data or upload it to S3, the time of the analytics process,
    and the users’ behavior.

    automation, and monitoring in place, you can start enhancing your system. It is
    time to get rid of weaknesses, optimize the overall performance and stability,
    and add new functions. Implementing new features will also allow you to offer
    new services or products.
