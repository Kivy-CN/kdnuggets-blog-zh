    based environment for executing Python code on hosted Jupyter notebooks and training
    models for machine learning, including free access to GPUs! It is a great platform
    for data scientists and machine learning (ML) engineers for learning and quickly
    developing ML models in Python. [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) is an
    in-memory open source database that is increasingly being used in machine learning
    - from caching, messaging and fast data ingest, to semantic search and [online
    feature stores](/2021/02/feature-store-foundation-machine-learning.html). In fact,
    NoSQL databases - and specifically Redis - was named by Ben Weber, Director of
    Applied Data Science at Zynga as one of the [8 new tools he learned as a data
    scientist](/2021/01/8-new-tools-learned-data-scientist-2020.html) in 2020.'

    it is very handy to be able to run Redis directly from your Google Colab notebook! 
    However, running Redis on Google Colab differs from how you would set it up on
    your local machine or using Docker. Below I’m going to show you how in two simple
    steps you can run Redis on your Colab notebook, all directly from your browser.

    To use Redis with [Python](https://www.python.org/), you need a [Redis Python
    client](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/references/client_references/client_python/).
    In this tutorial we demonstrate the use of [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/),
    a Redis Python Client, which we install using the `[%pip install](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/7.23.0/interactive/magics.html#magic-pip)

    all from your browser! We first installed Redis and the Redis Python client, then
    started the Redis server and verified that it’s running by creating a connection
    to it. Finally we saw how to read and write data from the Redis database using
    Redis command functions. If you want to play with commands yourself, here is a
    link to the [Redis with Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jPgmnGdlVPLQq3c9YqAsxc_gu6YReKaS?usp=sharing)
    that includes the code in this tutorial.
