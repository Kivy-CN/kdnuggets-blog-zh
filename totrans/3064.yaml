    place in multiple categories. For example, Keras is included in this list but
    TensorFlow has been omitted and features in the Deep Learning library collection
    instead. This is because Keras is more of an ‘end-user’ library like SKLearn,
    as opposed to TensorFlow which appeals more to researchers and Machine Learning
    engineer types.
