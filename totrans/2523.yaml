- en: Nearly a year ago, I announced the [Machine & Deep Learning Compendium](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-last-machine-deep-learning-compendium-youll-ever-need-dc973643c4e1),
    a [Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvtcwc8LOb3PZI9huQOD7UjqUoY98N5r3aQsWKNAlzk/edit) that
    I have been writing for the last 4 years. The ML Compendium contains over 500
    topics, and it is over 400 pages long.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, I’m announcing that the Compendium is fully open. It is now a project
    on [GitBook](https://book.mlcompendium.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/orico/www.mlcompendium.com/) (please
    star it!). I believe in knowledge sharing, and the Compendium will always be free
    to everyone.

- en: I see this compendium as a gateway, as a frequently visited resource for people
    of various proficiency levels, for industry data scientists, and academics. The
    compendium will save you countless hours googling and sifting through articles
    that may not give you any value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Compendium includes around 500 topics that contain various summaries, links,
    and articles that I have read on numerous topics that I found interesting or that
    I had needed to learn. It includes the majority of modern machine learning algorithms,
    statistics, feature selection and engineering techniques, deep-learning, NLP,
    audio, deep and classic vision, time series, anomaly detection, graphs, experiment
    management, and much more. In addition, strategic topics, such as data science
    management and team building, are highlighted as well as other essential topics,
    such as product management, product design, and a technology stack from a data
    science perspective.

    topics. If you feel that something should be changed, you can now easily contribute
    using GitBook, GitHub, or [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohenori/).

- en: The ML Compendium is a project on GitBook, which means that you can contribute
    as a GitBook writer. Writing and editing content using the internal editor is
    easy and intuitive, especially compared to the more advanced option of contributing
    via GitHub pull requests.

    access the [compendium “book”](https://book.mlcompendium.com/). As seen in Figure
    1, on the left you have the main topics and on the right the sub-topics which
    are in each main topic, not to mention that the search feature is more advanced,
    especially compared to the old method of using CTRL-F inside the original document.
