    since November 2022, many speculate their jobs will be taken over by their AI
    counterparts. One profession, however, cannot be possibly replaced: the researchers
    advancing deep neural networks and other machine learning models – the humans
    behind the AI. Although research is traditionally done within university walls,
    AI is by no means a traditional research field. A sizable portion of AI research
    is done in industrial labs. But which sector should aspiring researchers flock
    toward? Academia or industry?'

    is inclined to user-oriented research driven by the large data access,” says Nitesh
    Chawla, a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre
    Dame. Prof. Chawla points to the pursuit of knowledge as a separating factor between
    industrial and academic AI research. Within the industry, research is tied to
    a product, advancing towards a better society-- while within academia, the pursuit
    of pure discovery drives research breakthroughs. The seemingly endless academic
    freedom does not come without its drawbacks, “academia does not have the data
    nor the computing access available,” according to Prof. Chawla.

    has everything they could want. Vast, autonomous, commercial organizations striving
    toward innovation while supported by readily available data, computing power,
    and funding. This led to a perception that the industry is “stealing” talent away
    from academia. Academics, naturally, complain. A study published in 2021 by a
    team from Aalborg University pointed out that “increasing participation of the
    private sector in AI research has been accompanied by a growing flow of researchers
    from academia into industry, and especially into technology companies such as
    Google, Microsoft, and Facebook”.'

    top talent, and as such I’m not poaching academic talent, but rather I am trying
    to help them get industry awards, funding from industry, and have their students
    as interns,” explains Dr. Luna Dong, a Principal Scientist at Meta who is the
    head scientist working on Meta’s smart glasses. She sees a glaring difference
    between industry and academia, which could be credited to the fundamental way
    research is conducted. According to Dr. Dong, AI research within an industry is
    conducted by knowing what the end product should look like and reverse engineering
    a path toward it. In contrast, academics, having a promising idea, continuously
    construct various paths, not knowing where those paths would lead.

- en: Yet, despite these contrasts, Dr. Dong believes the industry helps academia
    and vice versa, “lots of industry breakthroughs are inspired by applying the research
    from academia on real use-cases.” Likewise, Computer Science Professor Ankur Teredesai
    from the University of Washington, Tacoma, describes the relationship between
    industry and academia as supporting each other, “symbiotic is the word that comes
    to mind.” As he views it, research practices have evolved into academics shifting
    their agenda to aid industry products -- a good example of that shift would be
    joint positions within major corporations that some prominent professors are holding.

    a few times a year at conferences. Prof. Chawla describes them as a “wonderful
    melting pot.” Some conferences are traditionally more academic, some purely industrial
    but some are a perfect blend of both. Prof. Chawla points to KDD, or the Special
    Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, a conference known for
    such a connection. KDD maintains two parallel peer-reviewed tracks: the research
    track and the applied data science (ADS) track. As put by Dr. Dong, who was the
    ADS Program Co-Chair at KDD-2022, “KDD is helpful by providing a forum for researchers
    and practitioners to come together to listen to the talks and discuss the techniques
    while inspiring each other. KDD is a place where we break the barriers of communication
    and collaboration, where we demonstrate how data science and machine learning
    advances with industry consumption.”'

- en: This is the mindset that drove KDD from its early days. “One of the things we
    wanted to do from the very beginning was to create a conference where applications
    were well represented,” commends Prof. Usama Fayyad, Executive Director of the
    Institute for Experiential AI at Northeastern University and a former Chief Data
    Officer of Yahoo, who together with Dr. Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro co-founded the
    KDD conference in 1995\. Prof. Fayyad believes that if AI conferences were only
    focused on academics, it would be a big miss due to the collective desire to prove
    research on real problems and motivation to drive new research based on emerging
    data sets.

- en: However, opening up KDD to the industry also had its challenges. With the research
    track being rightfully dominated by academia-originated work, the ADS track should
    have been primarily dedicated to applied studies coming from industrial research
    labs. In reality, more than half of ADS publications have their origins within
    academia or are a result of strong academic-industrial collaboration. A decade
    ago, Prof. Fayyad realized that many interesting AI applications were developed
    by teams that were simply too busy to write papers. He led KDD into its current
    phase, where KDD organizers venture and curate distinguished invited talks given
    by top industrial practitioners. The ADS invited talks have quickly become the
    highlight of the conference.

- en: The KDD Cup competition held annually in conjunction with the KDD conference,
    is yet another way to connect the academic and industrial worlds. “KDD Cup is
    a way to attract both industry and academia participants where companies bring
    some of the challenges that they are comfortable sharing, while academics get
    to work on data they would never have access to,” describes Prof. Teredesai, who
    is also the CEO of a health tech company CueZen. Each year, a novel task is introduced
    and a new dataset is released. Hundreds of teams sprint towards the most effective
    solution, competing for prizes and fame. Prof. Fayyad agrees, “It's been a very
    healthy thing for the field because we see participation from academia, students
    diving in, or even companies teaming together”.

    irrelevant. With academic courses taught by practitioners, professors leading
    industrial labs, global cloud computing resources becoming dominant, and more
    data becoming available, the academic-industrial boundaries are quickly getting
    blurred in the AI domain. No need to stick to any of the two sectors, just choose
    the project you are most excited about!
