- en: Algorithm efficiency relates to how many resources a computer needs to expend
    to process an algorithm. The efficiency of an algorithm needs to be determined
    to ensure it can perform without the risk of crashes or severe delays. If an algorithm
    is not efficient, it is unlikely to be fit for its purpose.

    it. An efficient algorithm uses minimal resources to perform its functions.

    These are time complexity and space complexity. However, a direct comparison cannot
    be made between them; therefore, we need to consider a combination of the two.

    execution of a program compared to the function input, i.e., the amount of memory
    on a computer or device that is required. The memory type could include registers,
    cache, RAM, virtual memory, and secondary memory.

    and it depends on all of the same factors used by space complexity, but these
    are broken down into a numerical function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This measure can be useful when comparing different algorithms, mainly when
    large quantities of data are being processed. However, if the amount of data is
    small, more detailed estimates will be needed when comparing the performance of
    algorithms. Time complexity is less effective when an algorithm uses parallel
    processing.

    an algorithm - theoretical analysis and benchmarking (measuring the performance).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In relation to algorithms, theoretical analysis is usually the process of estimating
    an algorithm’s complexity in an asymptotic manner (approaching a value or curve
    arbitrarily closely). The most common way of describing the number of resources
    an algorithm uses is by using Donald Knuth’s Big O notation.

    programmers will measure algorithms to ensure they scale efficiently, regardless
    of input data size.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When analyzing and testing new algorithms or software, benchmarks are used to
    measure their performance. This helps to gauge an algorithm’s efficiency compared
    to other well-performing algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s take a sorting algorithm as an example. Using benchmarks set by a previous
    version of the sorting algorithm can determine how efficient the current algorithm
    is, using known data while also taking into account its functional improvements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Benchmarking also allows analysis teams to compare algorithm speed against various
    other programming languages to establish if improvements can be made. In fact,
    benchmarking can be implemented in various ways to measure performance against
    any predecessors or similar software.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Implementing a new algorithm can sometimes impact its overall efficiency. This
    could be down to the chosen [programming language](/2021/05/top-programming-languages.html),
    the compiler options used, the operating system, or just how the algorithm has
    been coded. In particular, the compiler used for a specific language can greatly
    impact speed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When measuring space and time complexity, not everything can be dictated by
    the programmer. Issues such as cache locality and coherence, data alignment and
    granularity, multi-threading, and simultaneous multitasking can all impact performance,
    regardless of the programming language used or how the algorithm is written.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The processor used to run the software can also cause problems; some processors
    may support vector or parallel processing, whereas others may not. In some cases,
    utilizing such capabilities may not always be possible, making the algorithm less
    efficient and requiring some reconfiguration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the instruction set [used by a processor](/2020/05/tops-just-hype-dark-ai-silicon-disguise.html)
    (e.g., ARM or x86-64) may affect how quickly instructions are processed on various
    devices. This makes it difficult to optimize compilers due to the number of different
    hardware combinations that need to be considered.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An algorithm needs to be processed very quickly, so it must perform as flawlessly
    as possible. This is why every new algorithm goes through testing to calculate
    its efficiency, using theoretical analysis and benchmarking to compare it against
    other algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time and space complexity are the two main measures for calculating algorithm
    efficiency, determining how many resources are needed on a machine to process
    it. Where time measures how long it takes to process the algorithm, space measures
    how much memory is used.
