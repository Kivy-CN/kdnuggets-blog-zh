    Yet plodding through hours of data munging still feels **decidedly** **unsexy**.

    when you consider the fact that you’re probably working a job that didn’t exist
    ten years ago, it’s not surprising that this certification isn’t widespread just

    but the **100 questions** on the exam must be completed within **90 minutes **—
    not a lot of time to be looking things up. Therefore, it’s important to be extremely

    is the DAMA Body of Knowledge book ([*DMBOK*](https://amzn.to/2F0MGcM) $55). It’s
    around **600 pages**, but if you mainly focus your study time on Chapter 1 (Data

    this should get you 80% of the way toward a passing score.
