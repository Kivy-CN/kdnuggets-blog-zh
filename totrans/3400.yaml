    it provides the ability to automatically obtain deep insights, recognize unknown
    patterns, and create high performing predictive models from data, all without
    requiring explicit programming instructions.'

- en: This is a summary (with links) to an [article series](http://www.innoarchitech.com/machine-learning-an-in-depth-non-technical-guide/?utm_source=kdnuggets&utm_medium=post&utm_content=originallink&utm_campaign=guest)
    that's intended to be a comprehensive, in-depth guide to machine learning, and
    should be useful to everyone from business executives to machine learning practitioners.
    It covers virtually all aspects of machine learning (and many related fields)
    at a high level, and should serve as a sufficient introduction or reference to
    the terminology, concepts, tools, considerations, and techniques in the field.

    of the series starts with both a formal and informal definition of machine learning.
    This is followed by a discussion of the machine learning process end-to-end, the
    different types of machine learning, potential goals and outputs, and a categorized
    overview of the most widely used machine learning **algorithms**.

    starts with an introduction to the concept of **model performance**. The discussion
    then shifts to data **selection**, **preprocessing**, **splitting**, and the very
    interesting and critical topics of **feature selection** and **feature engineering**.
    This is followed by a discussion of **model selection** and the associated tradeoffs,
    which is a key step since different models can be applied to solve the same problems,
    although some perform better than others.'

    introduces the critical concepts of model **variance**, **bias**, and **overfitting**.
    This is followed by the related topic of **model complexity** and how to control
    it, which can have a large impact on overfitting or lack thereof. After, you''ll
    find a brief introduction to **dimensionality reduction**, and then a final discussion
    of model **evaluation**, **performance**, **tuning**, **validation**, **ensemble
    learning**, and **resampling methods**.'

    is heavily focused on a deeper dive into model **performance** and **error analysis**.
    Being able to determine the performance and errors associated with the model you''re
    using is paramount, as it helps determine if you''ve found a viable solution with
    acceptable tradoffs, or instead indicates that you need to make some changes.
    Possible changes include selecting different features and/or models, gathering
    more data, feature engineering, complexity reduction, leveraging ensemble methods,
    and so on.'

    is the final chapter in the series, and gives in in-depth overview of **unsupervised
    learning**. It then discusses other fields that are highly related to machine
    learning, such as **predictive analytics**, **artificial intelligence**, **statistical
    learning**, and **data mining**. The post ends with a brief overview of machine
    learning as used in real world applications.'

    to most key concepts and aspects of machine learning. In addition, you should
    be able to determine which areas interest you most, and thus guide further research.
