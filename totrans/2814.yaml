    [report and magic quadrant (MQ) for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms
    (DSML)](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3899464/magic-quadrant-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-pla)

    mentioned - see a list at the bottom of this blog.'

    same. Now the name has remained the same as in [2019 MQ](/2019/02/gartner-2019-mq-data-science-machine-learning-changes.html)
    and [2018 MQ](/2018/02/gartner-2018-mq-data-science-machine-learning-changes.html)
    reports, reflecting a more mature understanding of the DSML field, but the contents,
    especially the leader quadrant, have changed dramatically, reflecting accelerating
    progress and competition in the field.

- en: The 2020 MQ report went back to evaluating 16 vendors (down from 17 last year),
    placed as usual in 4 quadrants, based on completeness of vision (**vision** for
    short) and ability to execute (**ability** for short).
  prefs: []

    did not consider open-source platforms like Python and R, even though those are
    very popular with Data Scientists and Machine Learning professionals.

    based on showing strong company and product vision, especially in process automation
    and what Gartner calls "augmented DSML". Alteryx continues to have higher revenue
    growth than almost all other vendors in this MQ and also made significant international
