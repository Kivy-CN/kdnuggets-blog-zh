- en: Chatgpt has created quite a buzz in the world of AI. We have been witnessing
    numerous other models with incremental improvements. But none of them focused
    on improving the interaction between humans and AI. You still need to give it
    an excellent prompt to get your desired results. This is where AutoGPT stands
    out.  It can “**Self-Prompt**” and reviews its work critically. Are you curious
    to know about it? How does it work, and what makes it unique? And perhaps most
    importantly, what are its limitations? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Let's
    explore all of these questions in this article. Join me as we delve into the topic
    together.

- en: AutoGPT is an open-source application developed by  Toran Bruce Richards ( Game
    Developer and Founder of  Significant Gravitas). It uses GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 APIs
    to create fully autonomous AI agents. It stands out because you don’t need to
    steer the model based on your understanding. You just provide the task along with
    the list of objectives and it handles the rest. Unlike ChatGPT it can also access
    external resources to make its decision. Did you know that it has obtained more
    stars than Pytorch (A famous open-source ML Library) within a few weeks of its
    release? Here is a graph showing its star history.

    execute and prioritize the tasks autonomously. Being an autonomous system, it
    creates AI agents to perform specific tasks. These agents also communicate with
    one another. Here are the steps that describe how AutoGPT works:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Firstly, the user needs to enter the following three inputs: AI Name, AI Role,
    and up to 5 goals. For example, I can create an AI named MarketResearchGPT and
    its role will be to conduct the market analysis of different items. I can set
    goals like Performing market research for different phones, Getting the list of
    top 5 with their pros and cons, Arranging them in ascending order of their prices,
    Summarizing their user reviews, and Terminating the process when done.'

- en: 'Step 02: Task Creation Agent'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the user has entered the input, the task creation agent understands the
    goal, generates the list of tasks, and mentions the steps to achieve them. Then
    the resultant set of tasks is passed to the task prioritization agent.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The task prioritization agent reviews the sequence of the tasks to ensure that
    it logically makes sense. Because we don’t want to enter a deadlock situation
    where our current task depends on the result of the task that has not been executed
    yet.

    and other resources to perform these tasks.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Agents can communicate with each other to reach the user-defined goal. For example,
    if the unsatisfactory results were generated then it can communicate with Task
    Creation Agent to generate a new list of tasks. Hence, it becomes an iterative
    process.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although AutoGPT can generate content with minimal human intervention, it has
    some major downsides such as high costs, limited functionality, inadequate understanding
    of context, data bias, limited creativity, and security risks. It is not yet capable
    of achieving the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) due to data quality, generalization,
    and explainability issues. Despite the shortcomings, it has huge potential to
    revolutionize our daily lives and the way we work. I hope you enjoyed reading
    the article and do let me know in the comment section about what you think about
    AutoGPT.
