- en: For the longest time, I was quite against using R for no other reason other
    than the fact that it wasn’t Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But after playing around with R for the past few months, I realized that R outclasses
    Python in several use cases, particularly for statistical analyses. As well, R
    has some powerful packages that were built by the world’s biggest tech companies,
    and they **aren’t **in Python!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so, in this article, I wanted to go over three R packages that I **highly** **recommend **that
    you take the time to learn and equip in your arsenal of tools because they are
    seriously powerful tools.

- en: Let’s say your company launched a new TV ad for the Super Bowl and they wanted
    to see how it impacted conversions. Causal impact analysis attempts to predict
    what would have happened if the campaign never occurred — this is called the counterfactual.

- en: To give an actual example of what Causal impact does, it attempts to predict
    the counterfactual, i.e. the blue dotted line in the top graph, and then it compares
    the actual values to the counterfactual to estimate the delta.

- en: Marketing Mix Models (MMMs) are extremely popular, more than attribution models,
    because they allow you to measure the impact of immeasurable channels like TV,
    billboards, and radio.
  prefs: []

- en: Typically, Marketing Mix Models take months to build from scratch. But Facebook
    created a new R package, called Robyn, that can create a robust MMM in minutes.

    data points that differ significantly from the rest of the data.

    data, **which is a unique problem because you have to consider the trend and seasonality
    of the data as well.

    it all for you. It’s an intricate algorithm that can identify global and local
    anomalies. Aside from time series, it can also be used to detect anomalies in
    a vector of values.
