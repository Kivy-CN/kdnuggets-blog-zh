- en: In data science and statistics, confidence intervals are very useful for quantifying
    uncertainty in a dataset. The 65% confidence interval represents data values that
    fall within one standard deviation of the mean. The 95% confidence interval represents
    data values that are distributed within two standard deviations from the mean
    value. The confidence interval can also be estimated as the interquartile range,
    which represents data values between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile,
    with the 50th percentile representing the mean or median value.

    and maximum values of the data, excluding outliers. The round circles indicate
    the outliers. The orange line is the median value. From the figure, the interquartile
    range for male heights is [ 67 inches, 72 inches]. The interquartile range for
    female heights is [63 inches, 67 in]. The median height for males heights is 68
    inches, while the median height for female heights is 65 inches.
