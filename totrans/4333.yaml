- en: Plots (or charts) are an intrinsic way to communicate information from data,
    yet good plots are rare. The primary reason, I think, is due to the passive approach
    taken while creating plots. But, if created actively, using principles of data
    investigation and interrogation, one can produce sensible and meaningful plots.

    it lets you take a hands-on approach to learning using two custom web applications
    that permit you to explore/ set various options to create information rich scatter
    plots.

    , axes (e.g. x-axis, y-axis), description of the axes including markers/ labels
    for explaining the data (e.g. ticks, tick labels) and, when required, legend to
    distinguish sub-groups.
