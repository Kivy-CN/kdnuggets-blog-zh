- en: Around 18 months ago, I lost my job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I was working
    as a part-time tutor while in college. The money I got from tutoring was used
    to cover expenses like food, petrol, and my car.

    was unable to continue teaching. I couldn’t go to college either and had to study
    at home.

    and work freed up a lot of my time.

    some research, I found a machine learning online course that seemed pretty interesting.
  prefs: []

    getting online certifications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I first joined a company as a data science intern for some time and am now working
    there full time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At first, I expected my work to comprise primarily of model-building.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, once I joined, I realized that my work was only about 10% model-building.
    The rest of the time, my team and I were looking into new solutions we could create
    to solve business problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often, these problems didn’t even require machine learning to be solved. The
    data solution could just comprise of business logic translated into a simple SQL
    query.

    but I want to emphasize that creating a data science solution doesn’t start and
    end with model building.

    data scientists. It was also a way for me to showcase my ability to code and build
    ML models.

    a great way to enhance my data science portfolio.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I started to build an online presence within the data science community,
    I started getting multiple freelance offers. I’ve built machine learning models
    for clients on a one-off basis, created competitor-analysis reports, and written
    data science articles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I initially thought of freelancing, I pictured having to compete and bid
    for projects on an online platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, all of my freelance clients have reached out to me after reading my
    articles or taking a look at my portfolio projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A few months back, I built a clustering algorithm and posted a tutorial about
    it online. The next day, someone reached out to me, asking if I’d be interested
    in building a clustering model for their client.

    work in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my company, the data I work with usually comes in a certain pre-processed
    format, and I query the data with SQL and Python to make use of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When freelancing, however, client data comes in very different formats. Most
    of it isn’t processed or structured, and I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out
    the relationships between the datasets and making sense of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also need to collect external data to come up with an analysis, and this usually
    involves scraping third-party websites and using open-source tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I feel like freelancing has given me exposure to knowledge I don’t currently
    have at my day job, and I’m able to learn new things with every project I take
    on.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mentioned above that I took a data science online course, and things changed
    from there. You might be wondering how.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be completely honest, after taking my first data science online course, I
    felt lost. I spent about a month learning the different algorithms and training
    models with Scikit-Learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I simply didn’t know where to go from there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I started reading articles about people who managed to land a data science job
    without a Master’s degree or any professional qualification. I realized the importance
    of domain knowledge and solving problems with the help of data available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wasn’t necessary for me to build the most accurate models or understand the
    underlying algorithm behind the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I realized that the most important skill for me to have was the ability to solve
    problems using data. This meant that I had to go beyond machine learning algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I took courses in business analytics and ML engineering. I spent more time learning
    to code than I spent on theory. I spent time learning SQL and data manipulation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, I collected my own data from online sites with the help of web scraping.
    I used the data to solve a problem and built a simple machine learning web app
    with it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This way, I slowly gained the skills required to become an end-to-end data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even within the data analytics team at my job, if there are any projects that
    go beyond the scope of our daily work (projects that require external data collection
    or a new algorithm), I’m the one who usually gets assigned to it.

    you online. Too many, in fact, that you don’t know what to choose from.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    most jobs available out there require you to go beyond this.
