    go-to tool for sharing code with a wider audience. Carbon provides you with various
    themes options, different languages, and edition options to create a code block
    that works for you. The output of the code block is in PNG or SVG.'

- en: GitLab [Snippet](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/snippets.html) is similar to
    GitHub Gist but instead of going to another website. We can create code snippets
    within the project and share them with the team. Similarly, you can use snippets
    on Medium blogs, websites, and social media applications. In my opinion, GitLab
    provides a complete developers ecosystem where everything is available within
    the project.

    provide syntax highlighting in multiple color themes. It is quite similar to Carbon
    in terms of options but, instead of creating images, it changes your fonts within
    Google Docs. I use it for creating tutorials, writing reports, and creating drafts
    for a blog. Your editor will be quite impressed with the code highlighting as
    it improves your visual presentation.
