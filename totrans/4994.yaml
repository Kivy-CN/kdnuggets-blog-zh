    science job?  That’s the silver bullet question.  It is debated in many forums. 
    I could provide here my own answer to it and explain why, but I’d rather look
    at some data first.  After all, this is what machine learners and data scientists
    should do: look at data, not opinions.'

    It looks for occurrences over time of selected terms in job offers.  It gives
    an indication of what skills employers are seeking.  Note however that it is not
    a poll on which skills are effectively in use.  It is rather an advanced indicator
    of how skill popularity evolve (more formally, it is probably close to the first
    order derivative of popularity as the latter is the difference of hiring skills
    plus retraining skills minus retiring and leaving skills).

    with “machine learning” and “data science”, where skills are one of the prominent
    programming language Java, C, C++, and Javascript.  I also included Python and
    R which we know are popular for machine learning and data science, as well as
    Scala given its link to Spark, and Julia that some think is the next big thing
    here.  Running [this query](https://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/q-python-and-%28%22machine-learning%22-or-%22data-science%22%29-q-R-and-%28%22machine-learning%22-or-%22data-science%22%29-q-Java-and-%28%22machine-learning%22-or-%22data-science%22%29-q-Javascript-and-%28%22machine-learning%22-or-%22data-science%22%29-q-C-and-%28%22machine-learning%22-or-%22data-science%22%29-q-C++-and-%28%22machine-learning%22-or-%22data-science%22%29-q-Julia-and-%28%22machine-learning%22-or-%22data-science%22%29-q-scala-and-%28%22machine-learning%22-or-%22data-science%22%29.html)

    increased interest in machine learning and data science over the last few years.

    lead over Java is increasing, while the lead of Java over R is decreasing.  I
    must admit I have been surprised to see Java at the second place, I was expecting
    R instead.

    an uptick in the recent months.  Will Julia turn in one of the popular languages

    growth, then we confirm that Python and R grow faster than general purpose languages.

    fourth place.  R is only at the fifth rank. There is clearly an emphasis on high
    performance computing languages here.  Java is growing fast though.  It could
    reach second place soon, as for machine learning in general.  R isn’t going to
    be near the top anytime soon.  What surprises me is the the absence of Lua, although
    it is used in one of the major deep learning frameworks (Torch).  Julia isn’t
    present either.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer to the original question should now be clear.  Python, Java, and
    R are most popular skills when it comes to machine learning and data science jobs. 
    If you want to focus on deep learning rather than machine learning in general,
    then C++, and to some lesser extent C, are also worth considering.  Remember however,
    that this is only one way of looking at the problem.  You may get a different
    answer if you are looking for a job in academia, or if you just want to have fun
    learning about machine learning and data science during your spare time.

- en: What about my personal answer?  I answered earlier this year in [this blog](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Why_Python?lang=en).
    Besides having support from many top machine learning frameworks, Python is good
    fit for me because I have a computer science background.  I would also feel comfortable
    with C++ for developing new algorithms, given I’ve programmed in that language
    for most of my professional life.  But this is me, and people with different background
    may feel better with another language.  A statistician with limited programming
    skills will certainly prefer R.  A strong Java developer can stay with his favorite
    language as there are significant open sources with Java api.  And a case can
    certainly be made for any of the languages on these charts.

    before investing significant time in learning a language.
