    accurately to solve their data challenges and enable machine learning (ML). But
    before bringing your data into a machine learning model or any other analytics
    project, it’s important to ensure that it is clean, consistent, and accurate.
    Because much of today’s analytics is dependent on the context of the data, the
    task is best done by those closest to what the data actually represents; the business
    domain expert who can apply hunches, theories, and business knowledge to the data.

- en: Unfortunately, business users don’t usually come equipped with data science
    skills so bridging that gap can make the difference between gaining value from
    your data quickly. As result, many are applying data preparation (DP) to help
    data scientists and ML practitioners rapidly prepare and annotate their enterprise
    data to extend the value of the data across the enterprise for analytic workloads.

    has the ability to train, test, and validate them prior to deploying into production.
    Data preparation technology is being used to create the clean and annotated foundation
    needed for today’s modern machine learning yet, good DP historically takes more
    time than any other part of the machine learning process.

    as it leaves more time to test, tune, and optimize models to create greater value.
    To prepare data for both analytics and machine learning initiatives teams can
    accelerate machine learning and data science projects to deliver an immersive
    business consumer experience that accelerates and automates the data-to-insight

    into one input, such as when you have a collection of files representing daily
    transactions, but your machine learning model needs to ingest a year of data.
    Also, be sure to have a contingency plan in place for overcoming problems associated
    with sampling and bias in your data set and your machine learning model.

    looking for trends, outliers, exceptions, incorrect, inconsistent, missing, or
    skewed information. This is important because your source data will inform all
    of your model’s findings, so it is critical to be sure it does not contain unseen
    biases. For example, if you are looking at customer behavior nationally, but only
    pulling in data from a limited sample, you might miss important geographic regions.
    This is the time to catch any issues that could incorrectly skew your model’s
    findings, on the entire data set, and not just on partial or sample data sets.

- en: The next step in great data preparation is to ensure your data is formatted
    in a way that best fits your machine learning model. If you are aggregating data
    from different sources, or if your data set has been manually updated by more
    than one stakeholder, you’ll likely discover anomalies in how the data is formatted
    (e.g. USD5.50 versus $5.50). In the same way, standardizing values in a column,
    e.g. State names that could be spelled out or abbreviated) will ensure that your
    data will aggregate correctly. Consistent data formatting takes away these errors
    so that the entire data set uses the same input formatting protocols.

    extreme values, and outliers in your data. Self-service data preparation tools
    can help if they have intelligent facilities built in to help match data attributes
    from disparate datasets to combine them intelligently. For instance, if you have
    columns for FIRST NAME and LAST NAME in one dataset and another dataset has a
    column called CUSTOMER that seem to hold a FIRST and LAST NAME combined, intelligent
    algorithms should be able to determine a way to match these and join the datasets
    to get a singular view of the customer.

    of your data and reduce the skewness. Be sure to examine records outside an accepted
    range of value. This “outlier” could be an inputting error, or it could be a real
    and meaningful result that could inform future events as duplicate or similar
    values could carry the same information and should be eliminated. Similarly, take
    care before automatically deleting all records with a missing value, as too many
    deletions could skew your data set to no longer reflect real-world situations.

    that better represent a pattern to the learning algorithms. For example, data
    can be decomposed into multiple parts to capture more specific relationships,
    such as analyzing sales performance by the day of the week, not only the month
    or year. In this situation, segregating the day as a separate categorical value
    from the date (e.g. “Mon; 06.19.2017”) may provide the algorithm with more relevant
    information.

- en: The final step is to split your data into two sets; one for training your algorithm,
    and another for evaluation purposes. Be sure to select non-overlapping subsets
    of your data for the training and evaluation sets in order to ensure proper testing.
    Invest in tools that provide versioning and cataloging of your original source
    as well as your prepared data for input to machine learning algorithms, and the
    lineage between them. This way, you can trace the outcome of your predictions
    back to the input data to refine and optimize your models over time.

    to ready and prepare the data needed for analytics, operations, and regulatory
    requirements. Self-service data preparation that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    and Azure takes it to the next level by leveraging many valuable attributes of
    a cloud-based environment.

- en: As a result, business users who are closest to the data and most knowledgeable
    about its business context, can prepare data sets quickly and accurately, with
    the help of built-in intelligence and smart algorithms. They can work within an
    intuitive, visual application to access, explore, shape, collaborate and publish
    data with clicks, not code, with complete governance and security. IT professionals
    are able to maintain the scale of data volumes and variety across both enterprise
    and cloud data sources to support business scenarios for immediate and repeatable
    data service needs.
