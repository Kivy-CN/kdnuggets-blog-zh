    is more important than ever for businesses looking to continue to grow. The downside?
    As we continually discover ways in which data is beneficial, the more difficult
    it can become for individuals to compile, present and implement findings. Thankfully,
    there’s an influx of free data visualization tools that are able to take your
    unique data, both spatial and tabular, and present the information back to you
    through the use of advanced graphs and charts.

    we’ve assembled 5 of our favorite free data visualizations tools that take a much
    needed illustrative approach to complicated data.

- en: R Shiny is an open source package that provides the web framework for building
    data visualizations, interactive charts, and applications using R. This tool helps
    you to turn your analyses into sleek interactive web visuals without it requiring
    in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. Much like a spreadsheet, this reactive
    programming model allows for data to be manipulated with ease rather than waiting
    for the entire page to be reloaded...we’ve seen success for those within the retail
    sector who are constantly updating their data and looking for a platform that
    can keep up minute to minute.

- en: 'With the ability to display graphs, charts, maps and more, Tableau Public is
    a popular data visualization tool that''s also totally free. With up to 10 GB
    of storage and a drag-and-drop interface, users can watch their data update in
    real-time while collaborating with others on their team. The “public” portion
    of Tableau means that you can only save your data to public profile where others
    have access to your data, but if you’re not a highly public company whose privacy
    is your #1 concern, there are a plethora of upsides to Tableau Public for business
    analysts and managers. The newest version is optimized for mobile devices, can
    connect to a variety of data sources beyond Excel, and can link directly to Google
    Sheets.'

- en: Datawrapper is a great open source tool for the complete visualization of data
    and the ability to embed live and interactive charts. Simply upload your data
    in a CSV file and the online tool is able to build customized visuals such as
    bar and line graphs. Datawrapper is great for small business or presentation use,
    as it allows for only 10,000 views per chart, but it may not be ideal for big
    businesses with a large clientele. However, most people agree that the easy to
    use interface and ability to quickly present statistics in a straightforward manner
    is helpful.

- en: 'Pivot is an intuitive UI designed to enable exploratory analytics on event
    data while utilizing the much appreciated drag-and-drop interface. One of the
    attributes that sets Pivot apart is that it’s centered around two operations:
    Filter and Split. Filter narrows the view of data and is equivalent to the “WHERE”
    clause in SQL, where as Split is very similar to SQL’s “GROUP BY” function. However,
    Split allows for data to be cut across multiple dimensions -- we’ve seen great
    success in grocery price/promotional analysis and optimization.'

- en: D3, which stands for data driven documents, is a JavaScript library that binds
    to arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then applies data-driven
    transformations to the document. Though D3 may appeal more towards programmers
    as this tool involves creating code, D3 is able to build an array of truly engaging
    charts, maps, diagrams within web pages, and more. If you’re willing to put in
    a bit of extra work, the visual payout absolutely more than worth it.
