    of my clients come to me charging WAY less than they should be. While many go
    on to secure 6-figure contracts *(~10% of my mentorship clients have in the first
    7 months of signing up with me!)*, they often begin as struggling freelancers.

    The first category of freelancers I want to discuss is new data freelancers in
    western economies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a new data freelancer, you’ve most likely taken a few data implementation
    courses, you’ve built up a bit of a portfolio, but you’re still not established.
    You haven’t quite built up your online credibility and you don’t have those external
    benchmarks to validate that you can deliver results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you fall into this category, you want to charge *at least* ***$150/hour.***
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re a new data freelancer living in a non-western economy, say you’re
    located in India or The Philippines, you’ll want to aim for at least ***$100/hour.***
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**What about rates for experienced data freelancers?**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, let’s say you’ve got a kickass portfolio, raving testimonials, and a degree
    in your field, as well as some outside entities validating that you CAN get the
    results you promise. In this case, you NEED to be charging **a minimum of $300/hour.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re in a non-western economy, this might be a bit trickier for you, but
    I’d still really try and push for that $300/hour. In order to command those premium
    rates, you’ll need to ensure your branding is up to snuff and meets the expectations
    of western clients. You’ll also want to take the time to showcase testimonials
    and reviews that demonstrate your ability to get incredible results for your clients.

    results for your clients.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Once you have your standardized package, you’ll want to figure out how to increase
    the value of said package - *without having to increase how many hours it takes
    you to deliver.* Ask yourself: what are some reusable assets you can sell along
    with your service packages? Some great ideas for this could be adding things such
    as documentation, training videos, user guides, dashboards, and specifications.'

    places like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/). Often, freelance marketplaces like
    this become a ‘race to the bottom’ which makes it difficult for freelancers looking
    to charge premium prices.
  prefs: []

    drive traffic to your site via **social media.** You could even make a featured
    post or highlight on your social media channels all about how to work with you,
    with a link to your website to learn more. For more strategies on [how to sign
