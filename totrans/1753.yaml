    very complex for many companies. The reason? A disconnect between the tools and
    techniques used in the design environment and the live production environment.

    all types of industries and data science advancement on how they managed to overcome
    these difficulties and analyzed the results. Here are the key things to keep in
    mind when you're working on your design-to-production pipeline.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data project is a messy thing. It’s lots of data in loads of different formats
    stored in different places, and lines and lines (and lines!) of code, and scripts
    in different languages turning that raw data into predictions. Packaging all that
    together can be tricky if you do not support the proper packaging of code or data
    during production, especially when you’re working with predictions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Small iterations are key to accurate predictions in the long term, so it’s critical
    to have a process in place for retraining, validation, and deployment of models.
    Indeed, models need to constantly evolve to adjust to new behaviors and changes
    in the underlying data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to efficient retraining is to set it up as a distinct step of the data
    science production workflow. In other words, an automatic command that retrains
    a predictive model candidate weekly, scores and validates this model, and swaps
    it after a simple verification by a human operator.

    facing many difficulties deploying into production and the limited involvement
    of business teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is critical during the development of the project to ensure that the end
    product is understandable and usable by business users. Once the data product
    is in production, it remains an important success factor for business users to
    assess the performance of the model, since they base their work on it. There are
    several ways to do this; the most popular is setting up live dashboards to monitor
    and drill down into model performance. Automatic emails with key metrics can be
    a safer option to make sure business teams have the information at hand.

- en: 4\. Your IT Environment Consistency Strategy
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Modern data science relies on the use of several technologies such as Python,
    R, Scala, Spark, and Hadoop, along with open-source frameworks and libraries.
    This can cause an issue when production environments rely on technologies like
    JAVA, .NET, and SQL databases, which could require complete recoding of the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The multiplying of tools also poses problems when it comes to maintaining the
    production as well as the design environment with current versions and packages
    (a data science project can rely on up to 100 R packages, 40 for Python, and several
    hundred Java/Scala packages). To manage this, two popular solutions are to maintain
    a common package list or to set up virtual machine environments for each data
    project.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With efficient monitoring in place, the next milestone is to have a rollback
    strategy in place to act on declining performance metrics. A rollback strategy
    is basically an insurance plan in case your production environment fails.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good rollback strategy has to include all aspects of the data project, including
    the data, the data schemas, transformation code, and software dependencies. It
    also has to be a process accessible by users who aren’t necessarily trained data
    engineers to ensure reactivity in case of failure.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being able to audit to know which version of each output corresponds to what
    code is critical. Tracing a data science workflow is important if you ever need
    to trace any wrongdoing, prove that there is no illegal data use or privacy infringement,
    avoid sensitive data leaks, or demonstrate quality and maintenance of your data
    flow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common way to control versioning is (unsurprisingly) Git or SVN. However,
    keeping logs of information about your database systems (including table creation,
    modifications, and schema changes) is also a best practice.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Real-time scoring and online learning are increasingly trendy for a lot of use
    cases including scoring fraud prediction or pricing. Many companies who do scoring
    use a combination of batch and real-time, or even just real-time scoring. And
    more and more companies report using online machine learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These technologies lead to complications in terms of production environment,
    rollback and failover strategies, deployment, etc. However, they don't necessitate
    setting up a distinct process and stack for these technologies, only monitoring
    adjustments.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As your data science systems scale with increasing volumes of data and data
    projects, maintaining performance is critical. This means setting up a system
    that’s elastic enough to handle significant transitions, not only in pure volume
    of data or request numbers, but also in complexity or team scalability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But scalability issues can come unexpectedly from bins that aren’t emptied,
    massive log files, or unused datasets. They’re prevented by having a strategy
    in place to inspect workflows for inefficiencies or monitoring job execution time.
