This is pretty good considering how few lines of code we had to write! The downside however to using a Multi-Layer Preceptron model is how difficult it is to interpret the model itself. The weights and biases won't be easily interpretable in relation to which features are important to the model itself.    However, if you do want to extract the MLP weights and biases after training your model, you use its public attributes coefs_ and intercepts_.    **coefs_** is a list of weight matrices, where weight matrix at index i represents the weights between layer i and layer i+1.    **intercepts_** is a list of bias vectors, where the vector at index i represents the bias values added to layer i+1.    `4`    `30`    `30`    ### Conclusion      Hopefully you've enjoyed this brief discussion on Neural Networks!
