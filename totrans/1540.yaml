- en: Getting your first role as a data scientist is tough, that's why we created
    S2DS, a 5-week data science bootcamp helping analytical PhDs transition from academia
    to industry. Participants work in teams on a real data science project for established
    companies such as Barclays, Ted Baker, KPMG, hot startups, and many more, learning
    how to use data science technologies and skills in a commercial environment and
    receive mentorship from the business and our internal team throughout.

    reviewing your CV and gives you something impressive and tangible to discuss at
    interview. The communication skills and business acumen you will acquire are essential
    skills for communicating to stakeholders and non-technical personnel.
