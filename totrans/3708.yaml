    to use technology to improve our lives. Because of the popularity of NLP, you
    can build NLP projects in many ways. One of those ways is by using Python and
    the library spaCy.

- en: spaCy is an open-source library for advanced NLP written in Python and Cython.
    spaCy allows you to build real-life NLP applications with ease. If you're new
    to NLP, [this](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/02/basics-of-natural-language-processing-nlp-basics/)
    great article on Analytics Vidhya goes through the basics of NLP in a very straightforward
    way. They also have a great [guide](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/beginners-guide-of-natural-language-processing-using-spacy/)
    to help you navigate your way through the NLP world.

    Whenever I come across a new library of software packages, I visit the official
    website for materials before branching out to other resources. The official spaCy
    website offers a short, helpful [4-chapter course](https://course.spacy.io/en/)
    about using the package from start to mastery.

- en: Though these resources are enough to set you on your path to becoming an NLP
    master, I am always a fan of a summary and a cheat sheet that I can keep on hand
    if I forget how to use a specific function. Luckily, [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/spacy-cheat-sheet-advanced-nlp-in-python)
    has a great cheat sheet for spaCy that you can save as a guide to the most commonly
    used functions in spaCy.
