    and prepared. Once the data goes through various stages of fitness tests it then
    finally becomes qualified for further processing. The processing could be of several
    methods - data ingested to BI tools, CRM database, developing algorithms for analytical
    models, data management tools and so on.

    information is accurate and trustworthy. The foundation of achieving this output
    lies in the health of the data. Additionally, whether you build your own models
    or get them from third parties, you must ensure that the data behind this entire
    process is labeled, augmented, clean, structured - to summarize, that is data
    preparation.

    raw data (which may come from disparate data sources) into a form that can readily
    and accurately be analyzed, e.g. for business purposes. Data preparation is the
    first step in data analytics projects and can include many discrete tasks such
    as loading data or data ingestion, data fusion, data cleaning, data augmentation,
    and data delivery.

    this is a good sign, considering that as good data goes into building the analytical
    model, the accurate gets the output. But, data scientists should ideally be spending
    more of their time interacting with data, advanced analytics, training and evaluating
    the model, and deploy to production.
  prefs: []

    time constraints, organizations need to reduce the time taken (varies depending
