- en: A multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a machine learning framework that uses complex
    algorithms to dynamically allocate resources when presented with multiple choices.
    In other words, it’s an advanced form of A/B testing that’s most commonly used
    by data analysts, medicine researchers, and marketing specialists.

    reinforcement learning, as well as the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma. Then,
    we can focus on various bandit solutions and practical applications.

    of the basic three paradigms of [machine learning](/2022/12/complete-machine-learning-study-roadmap.html).
    Unlike the first two archetypes we mentioned, reinforcement learning focuses on
    rewards and punishments for the agent whenever it interacts with the environment.

    basis. For instance, if your puppy chews through your computer cables, you may
    scold him and express your dissatisfaction at its actions. By doing so, you will
    teach your dog that destroying cables around the house is not a good thing to
    do. This is negative reinforcement.

    predetermined chances of getting a winning result in the long term when using

    time, you’re deciding where to buy your vegetables. There are three choices available.
    The supermarket, local grocery store, and the nearby farmers market. Each has
    different factors to consider, such as pricing and whether the food is organic,
    but we’ll focus solely on food quality for this example.

    were most often satisfied with the vegetables from the farmers market. At some
    point, you will make a conscious decision to purchase your greens exclusively
    from the said market.

- en: On rare occasions when the market is closed you may be forced to try the store
    or the supermarket again and the outcome might make you change your mind. The
    best bandit agents are programmed to do the same thing and try the less-rewarding
    options again from time to time and reinforce the data they already have.

    to A/B testing, multi-armed bandits allow you to gather advanced information based
    on an extended period of time rather than making a choice after only a brief period
    of testing.

    agents are completely random. They focus on exploration and never exploit any
    of the data they have gathered.

    possible solution since they already have all the data to exploit. Being paradoxical
    by nature, this makes them possible in theory only and equally bad as the random
    agents.

- en: Epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandits take care of the balance between exploration
    and exploitation by adding the exploration value (epsilon) to the formula. In
    case epsilon equals 0.3, the agent will explore random possibilities 30% of the
    time and focus on exploiting the best average outcome the other 70% of time.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A decay parameter is also included and it reduces epsilon over time. When constructing
    the agent, you may decide to remove epsilon from the equation after a certain
    amount of time or actions taken. This will cause the agent to focus solely on
    exploitation of the data it already gathered and remove random tests from the
    equation.

    the key difference between the two is an additional parameter included when building
    upper confidence bound bandits.
  id: totrans-37
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A variable is included in the equation that forces the bandit to focus on the
    least-explored possibilities from time to time. For example, if you have options
    A, B, C, and D, and option D has only been chosen ten times, while the rest have
    been selected hundreds of times, the bandit will purposefully select D to explore
    the outcomes.
  id: totrans-38

    avoid a huge yet quite improbable mistake of never exploring the best possible
    outcome.

    by far the most advanced bandit solution on the list, an essay-length article
    would be required to explain how it works with sufficient detail. However, we
    can opt for a less intricate analysis instead.
  id: totrans-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Thompson bandit is able to trust certain choices more or less based on how
    often they were picked in the past. For example, we have option A that the agent
    chose a hundred times with an average reward ratio of 0.71\. We also have option
    B that was chosen a total of twenty times with the same average reward radio as
    option A.
  id: totrans-42
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, the Thompson sampling agent would go for option A a bit more often.
    This is because a higher frequency of choosing a path tends to yield lower average
    rewards. The agent assumes option A is more trustworthy and option B would have
    lower average outcomes if it was chosen more frequently.

    at Data Council talking about how they applied multi-armed bandits to determine
    which of their titles should be displayed more often to audiences. Marketers may
    find the demonstration quite interesting, as it explains how different factors
    such as how often titles were replayed or even paused by those watching affected
    multi-armed bandit solutions.

    including marketing, finance, and even health. However, much like reinforcement
    learning itself, they are severely limited by changing environments. If the circumstances
    tend to vary, MABS have to start “learning” all over again every time and become
    a less useful tool.
