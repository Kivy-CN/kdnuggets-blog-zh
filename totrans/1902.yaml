    100 positive cases among 10,000 cases. You want to predict which ones are positive,

    cases.  You record the IDs of your predictions, and when you get the actual results
    you sum up how many times you were right or wrong. There are four ways of being

    the principles of scientific methodology are violated leading to misleading innovations,
    i.e. appealing insights that are confirmed without rigorous validation. One such
