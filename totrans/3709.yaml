    discover customer intent and opinion about a brand from customer feedback given
    in reviews, forums, surveys, and so on. Sentiment analysis of customer experience
    data gives businesses deep insight into motivations behind purchase decisions,
    the patterns in changing brand sentiment based on timelines or events, and [market-gap

    or sentiments](/2018/08/emotion-sentiment-analysis-practitioners-guide-nlp-5.html).
    Broadly, these are positive, negative, or neutral. But within these parameters,
    a sentiment analysis model driven by ML tasks such as natural language processing
    (NLP) and semantic analysis that can find the semantic and syntactic aspects of
    words can help find different types of negative sentiment as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, it can help give varying sentiment scores based on words that denote
    different negative emotions such as anxiety, disappointment, regret, anger, and
    so on. The same is the case with positive micro sentiments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such fine-grained emotion mining combined with aspect-based analysis of a customer’s
    experience with a brand can be of prime importance. For example, when you know
    sentiment based on aspects like price, convenience, ease-of-purchase, customer
    service, etc, you get actionable insights that you can depend on to make the right
    decisions when it comes to quality control and product improvement.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is having reliable customer feedback data. Here are five essential ways in which
    you can collect such data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Social media listening is one of the ways in which you can get current customer
    feedback about your brand, which includes both your product as well as service.
    A sentiment analysis model that can process and evaluate social media comments,
    as well as video content, is the perfect bet to leverage this data source.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With such a tool, you harness data for customer sentiment analysis from text-heavy
    social media sites like Twitter to video-based ones like TikTok or Instagram.
    This gives you a great advantage because not all social media platforms are one-size-fits-all
    when it comes to [customer choices.](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/ofcom-news-consumption-report-shows-social-media-users-are-still-concerned-by-fake-news-/s2/a845925/)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, while customers mainly use Twitter to directly interact with a
    brand, Facebook users are known to leave detailed remarks about a business they
    have associated with. This stark contrast is due to factors such as the nature
    of the business, age, geographic location, digital usage, and so on.

    find social media Influencers who fit your bill and can be an awesome addition
    to your digital marketing strategy. Influencers cost half the investment that
    goes into hiring a PR agency or celebrity endorsement.

    (CES), or star ratings can tell you at a glance whether people are happy with
    your business or not. But this doesn’t really give you any actual business insight.

    And for that, you need to analyze comments and open-ended survey responses that
    do not have any fixed response. This allows customers to write free-flowing comments,
    which can give you insight into aspects of your business that you were not even
    aware of.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another excellent way to get diverse customer feedback data is by sieving through
    product review websites like GoogleMyBusiness and forums such as Reddit. Importantly,
    getting insights from different data sources can give you better insights because
    of the type of audience different platforms invite.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, Reddit is mostly used by customers who are more passionate about
    a subject or product because the forum allows them to have verbose discussions.
    While, Amazon reviews or Google reviews are mostly used by casual customers who
    would like to leave a review either at the nudge of the business or because of
    the experience, good or bad, that they might have had.

    customer emails, customer support transcripts, and so on are brilliant sources
    to gain customer experience insights. An advantage of these sources is that all
    this data is already available in your customer relationship management (CRM)
    tools.

    news sources as the vital source of customer feedback and see how an ML model

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    publically. This includes news from television channels, online magazines and
    other publications, radio broadcasts, podcasts, videos, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    through Live news APIs like Google News API, [ESPN Headlines API](http://www.espn.com/apis/devcenter/),
    [BBC News API](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/juicer/), and others like them.
    Or, we manually upload them to the ML model we are using by downloading the comments
    and articles in a .csv file.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model now processes the data and identifies the different formats - text,
    video, or audio. In the case of text, the process is fairly simple. The model
    extracts all the text including [emoticons](https://www.psychologistworld.com/emotion/emoticons-emojis-emotion-psychology)
    and hashtags. In the case of podcasts, radio broadcasts, and videos, it will require
    audio transcription through speech-to-text software. This data too is then sent
    to the text analytics pipeline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once in the pipeline, natural language processing (NLP), named entity recognition
    (NER), semantic classification, etc make sure that key aspects, themes, and topics
    from the data are extracted and grouped so that they can be analyzed for sentiment.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that the text has been segregated, each theme, aspect, and entity is analyzed
    for sentiment and the sentiment score is calculated. This can be done in any of
    three approaches - word count method, sentence-length method, and the ratio of
    positive and negative words.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us take this sentence as an example. *“Stadium goers remarked that the seats
    were good. However, the tickets did seem too costly, given that there were no
    season passes available, and many even encountered rude staff at the ticket counter,

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the simplest way in which the sentiment score can be calculated. In
    this method, we reduce the negative from the positive occurrences (1 - 2 = -1)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sentence-length method
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The number of positive words is subtracted from the negative words. The result
    is then divided by the total number of words in the text. Because the score thus
    arrived can be very small and follow into many decimal places, it is often multiplied
    by a single digit. This is done so that the scores are bigger and thus easier
    to comprehend and compare. In the case of our example, the score will be.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    words. The result is then added by 1\. This is more balanced than other approaches,

    dashboard so you can understand the intelligence that has been garnered from all
    the data. You can see timeline-based sentiment analysis, as well as those based
    on events such as product launches, stock market fluctuations, press releases,
    company statements, new pricing, etc.
