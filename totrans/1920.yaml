    is a lot of value in getting really deep technical expertise. But it doesn''t
    matter that much whether you spent two years as a developer or seven years. Within
    a few years of college graduation, make a choice. Do you want to be an engineer
    for the next 10, 20, 30 years or not? If you don''t, start trying to move on now.
    More time as an engineer won''t help you that much.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is an interpreted, dynamically-typed language with a precise and efficient
    syntax. Python has a good REPL and new modules can be explored from the REPL with
    dir() and docstrings. That's one reason to prefer Python over C, C++, or Java.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use R for statistical analysis and prototyping machine learning models; Use
    Python for implementing machine learning pipelines in production environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: R is simply better than Python for data analysis, because R is designed at the
    beginning for statistical computing and has vast amount of 3rd-party packages
    for all kinds of statistical analysis.

    raw mathematical & coding ability (whatever that is).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I first started studying machine learning, I was overwhelmed by all the
    mathematical notation and abstract concepts. But over time, I gained a comfort
    level that allowed me to use math to reason very efficiently about different aspects
    of machine learning. After all, math is just a language, albeit one that is impeccably
    precise and rigorous.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a degree in CS, you should be able to handle most of the programming part,
    it is just the matter of using a different set of libraries and packages. The
    more important part is to learn the concept and algorithm behind machine learning,
    and data processing.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's hard to recommend a masters in stats or engineering as those may be too
    much of a jump. Consider "bootcamp"-like programs as a relatively cheaper, structured
    way to jump-start your background and try to get a job where you can invest time
    into learning through the rest of the background.

    really want to hire smart, eager people who can work on the many problems surrounding
    data, and most roles don't require 'full stack data science'.
