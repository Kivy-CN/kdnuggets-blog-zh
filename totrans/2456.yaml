- en: Mathematics is the core of all machine learning algorithms. And while it isn’t
    a prerequisite to have formal math education in order to become a data scientist,
    you need to understand the principles of the subject well enough to successfully
    build models that add value.

- en: This is a simple introduction to linear algebra, and concepts are explained
    to the reader with the help of interactive visualizations. In an effort to make
    the subject easier to understand, this book makes topics more generalized and
    abstract, with examples provided in each chapter.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike traditional linear algebra courses that teach you to solve linear equations
    manually, this learning track by FastAI will demonstrate the implementation of
    these techniques using a computer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this course, you will learn to perform matrix computations in Python with
    the help of libraries like Numba and PyTorch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best part of this course is that it takes a top-down approach to learning.
    While most math courses tend to focus on theory, FastAI’s linear algebra course
    will provide you with code examples and practical examples before diving into
    more complex details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The top-down approach makes it easier for students to focus, as they are able
    to work on interesting applications first before diving into the math-heavy content.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This course assumes that you have basic knowledge of linear algebra, so I recommend
    reading the textbook above as a pre-requisite before taking the course.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a series of video lectures by MIT OpenCourseWare that has been made
    freely available to the public. There are 34 video lectures in this course taught
    by Prof. Gilbert Strang, whose teaching style is intuitive and will provide you
    with a different outlook on problem-solving.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each section comes with a problem set, and I’d recommend solving the problems
    for each lecture before moving on to the next.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you find that the problem set isn’t sufficient and that you lack practice,
    you can complement this course with its accompanying textbook (written by the
    same professor) — [Linear Algebra and its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-4th/dp/0030105676).
    However, keep in mind that while the course is available for free, the book comes
    with a cost.

    starting out with some lighter content such as [3Blue1Brown’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
    or [Khan Academy’s](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) linear algebra
    course. These videos are created for complete beginners to math, and will serve
    as an easy introduction to the subject before you move on to deeper material listed
    above.
