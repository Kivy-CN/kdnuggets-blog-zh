    forward to the next step: land your first job as a Data Scientist. However, if
    this is not your first job ever then probably this is the first time applying
    for a role unrelated to your previous career. So, why not learn from other people’s
    mistakes?'

    I started with online learning at DataQuest. Then, earlier this year, I made one
    of the best decisions of my career: I have signed up for the Le Wagon bootcamp
    — I also wrote a [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-best-data-science-bootcamp-for-startups-in-the-world-e9ae2b4ce6e6) about
    it. Although bootcamps are intensive in their nature, the toughest part of any
    career change is to land your “first gig.”'

    a Data Scientist based in London, UK. But the process of finding my first job
    as a Data Scientist was by no means easy. I have applied to over fifty roles,
    done several interviews, some of which were purely technical or included live
    coding. During this period, I have learned a lot and would like to share five
    tips that could help you find your first job as a Data Scientist:'

    know. What is worse, you may think you know, but you don’t. Let me give you an
    example: during the bootcamp, I have created several machine learning models using
    Scikit-learn’s logistic regression. I was tuning the penalty parameter almost
    intuitively, especially between `l1` and `l2`, which refer to Lasso and Ridge
    respectively. So far so good.'

    but it backfired. As I tried to explain the difference, I realised that I knew
    how to apply them, but I didn’t understand the concept (let alone the math) behind
    it. Needless to say that I didn’t get that job. My advice here is to deep dive
    into few projects to the point that you know your code line by line. Try explaining
    to other colleagues, in mock interviews, why you have chosen each model, parameter.
    You will notice many gaps that can be filled before going to interviews. In doing
    so, you will also sound fluent using the correct terms and feel confident explaining
    your work.

- en: If you are serious about getting a job as a Data Scientist in your first couple
    of months, then you should learn from those who have a lot of experience. Teachers
    and teaching assistants are excellent sources of information, so speak to them
    daily. Ask a question about recruitment processes, interviews and how to manage
    conversations with recruiters to find out more about the company and the role.

- en: 'Also, I’ve created a slack channel with two other bootcamp alumni. In this
    channel, we share our CVs, cover letters, feedback from interviews and tests.
    We’ve discussed interview questions and answers, and we are always sharing our
    codes and notebooks to help each other. Don’t be afraid to share your work, instead
    learn to work together. After all, you have the same goal: to become a Data Scientist
    — asap.'

- en: It should come as a surprise to any recruiter that you don’t have ‘commercial
    experience’ as a Data Scientist. Just by looking at your CV anyone can tell that
    you are seeking your first job. That said, don’t try to sell yourself as an expert
    Data Scientist (from Kaggle projects), this is not your most valuable skill at
    this stage.

- en: 'After I got an offer from Nextdoor, the HR manager gave me feedback from each
    of the eight interviews I had done. It can be summarised in one ‘pro’ and one
    ‘con’: I am eager to learn but I don’t have coding experience. What I have learned
    is that hiring managers are looking for people who are keen to learn new things
    and keep up with the industry.'
  prefs: []

- en: So, show that you are a curious person, you enjoy the process of learning data-related
    topics, and you practice coding every day. Demonstrate your passion for the field
    of data, computer sciences, statistics. Your motivation and commitment to continuous
    learning will (and should) outweigh your current coding skills.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowing what you want without ever having experienced it is somewhat abstract.
    How do you know you want to be a Data Scientist but not a Machine Learning Engineer
    or a Data Engineer or a Data Analyst? At first, all those positions seem very
    similar and perhaps you would accept any of those as your first job. Well, that
    is what I thought in the beginning, and it is a mistake.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key difference at the job-seeking stage lies in the preparation for interviews.
    If you know that you want a Data Scientist job, make sure you know exactly what
    Data Scientists do. As you research, some nuances will start to stand out. For
    example, Data Scientists tend not to use Tableau, used by data analysts, or Docker,
    used by Data Engineers. You don’t have to develop a wide breadth of Data Science
    knowledge, instead, you could improve the depth of what you will need in the new
    job. Some examples include Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn linear and logistic regression,
    matplotlib, and seaborn. If you master these, I am certain you will get a Data
    Scientist job very soon.

- en: 'I cannot stress this enough: please, get used to being rejected by recruiters,
    hiring managers and companies. At the beginning of the process of seeking your
    first Data Scientist job, you are highly motivated and nothing can stop you.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, as the weeks go by and the rejections keep popping in your inbox, your
    motivation level inevitably crashes. There are plenty of Data Scientists roles
    out there, as well as an increasing number of candidates. Also, hiring processes
    are slow but much slower from a candidate point of view. I received rejection
    emails after two months in the new job. Anyway, it is natural to get rejected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An idea to keep your motivation high is to share it with a group of friends
    who are going through the same process. Like I have said before, create a slack
    channel with other alumni and share your frustrations. I am sure they are also
    going through the same thing. This is important because you will notice that you
    are not rubish at coding, it is just a matter of time, consistency and effort.
