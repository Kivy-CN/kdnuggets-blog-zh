- en: Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
    its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information allow users
    to consume and share the news. On the other hand, it can make viral “fake news”,
    i.e., low-quality news with intentionally false information. The quick spread
    of fake news has the potential for calamitous impacts on individuals and society.
    For [example](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook?utm&utm_term=.xcGkVBNoxk#.wwwqW6rpmq),
    the most popular fake news was more widely spread on Facebook than the most popular
    authentic mainstream news during the U.S. 2016 president election. Therefore,
    fake news detection on social media has attracted increasing attention from researchers
    to politicians.

- en: Fake news detection on social media has unique characteristics and presents
    new challenges. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to
    believe false information, which makes it difficult to detect based on news content.
    Thus, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements
    on social media, to help differentiate it from the true news. Second, exploiting
    this auxiliary information is nontrivial in and of itself as users’ social engagements
    with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy.
    This quick guide is based on a recent [survey](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3137600)
    [1] that presents issues of fake news detection on social media, state-of-the-art
    research findings, datasets, and further directions. Next, we will highlight the
    major perspectives for this survey.

    phases: characterization and detection. Fake news itself is not a new problem,
    and the media ecology has been changing over time from newsprint to radio/television,
    and recently online news and social media. The impact of fake news on traditional
    media can be described from the perspective of psychology and social theories.
     For example, two major psychology factors make consumers naturally vulnerable
    to the fake news: (i) Naïve Realism: consumers tend to believe that their perceptions
    of reality are the only accurate views. (ii) Confirmation Bias: consumers prefer
    to receive information that confirms their existing views. As another example,
    social identity theory and normative influence theory describe that preference
    for social acceptance is essential to a person’s identity, making people choose
    “socially safe” option for consuming news, even the news being shared is fake
    news.'

    accounts can be easily and quickly created to boost the spread of fake news, such
    as social bots, cyborg users, or trolls. In addition, users are selectively exposed
    to certain types of news because of the way news feed appear on the homepage in
    social media. Therefore, users on social media tend to form groups containing
    like-minded people where they are likely to polarize their opinions, resulting
    in an echo chamber effect.

    Existing algorithms for fake news detection can be generally categorized as (i)
    News Content Based and (ii) Social Context Based.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: News content based approaches focus on extracting various features in fake news
    content, including knowledge-based and style-based. Since fake news attempts to
    spread false claims, knowledge-based approaches aim to using external sources
    to fact-check the truthfulness of the claims in news content. In addition, fake
    news publishers often have malicious intents to spread distorted and misleading,
    requiring particular writing styles to appeal to and persuade a wide scope of
    consumers that are not seen in true news articles. Style-based approaches try
    to detect fake news by capturing the manipulators in the writing style.

- en: Social context based approaches aim to utilize user social engagements as auxiliary
    information to help detect fake news. Stance-based approaches utilize users’ viewpoints
    from relevant post contents to infer the veracity of original news articles. In
    addition, propagation-based approaches reason about the relations of relevant
    social media posts to guide the learning of credibility scores by propagating
    credibility values between users, posts, and news. The veracity of a news piece
    is aggregated by the credibility values of relevant social media posts.

- en: Even though online news can be collected from different sources, manually determining
    the veracity of news is a challenging task, usually requiring annotators with
    domain expertise who performs a careful analysis of claims and additional evidence,
    context, and reports from authoritative sources. Existing public datasets of fake
    news are rather limited due to these challenges. To facilitate the research for
    fake news detection, this survey [1] provides a usable dataset, named [FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet),
    which includes news content and social context features with reliable ground truth
    fake news labels.
