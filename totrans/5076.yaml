    only 2 discuss the merits of using both R and Python rather than pitting them
    against each other. This is understandable; from their inception, both have had
    very distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Historically, though, the split has
    been one of educational background: statisticians have preferred the approach
    that R takes, whereas programmers have made Python their language of choice. However,
    with the growing breed of data scientists, this distinction blurs:'

    language of choice for any application may come down to prior knowledge and experience.
    For some applications – especially in prototyping and development – it is faster
    for people to use the tool that they already know.
