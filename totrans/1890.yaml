    Quora answer to [What is the work flow or process of a data scientist?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-work-flow-or-process-of-a-data-scientist).
    This answer, written by Ryan Fox Squire, a self-described "Neuroscientist Turned
    Data Scientist," employed **The Data Science Process** as it described such a
    workflow.

    and is crafted by Joe Blitzstein and Hanspeter Pfister of [Harvard's CS 109](http://cs109.github.io/2015/).
    The goal of CS 109, [as per Blitzstein himself](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-design-a-data-science-class/answer/Joe-Blitzstein),
    is to introduce students to the overall process of data science investigation,
    a goal which should provide some insight into the framework itself.

    iterative process, and that there are many skills and tools required to cover
    the full data science process. Squire also professes that he is fond of the Data
    Science Process as it stresses both the importance of asking questions to guide
    your workflow, and the importance of iterating on your questions and research,
    as one gains familiarity with one's data.

    and elaborated upon by Squire, we take a quick look at the *de facto* official
    (yet unquestionably falling out of fashion) data mining framework (which has been
    extended to data science problems), the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data
    Mining (CRISP-DM). Though the standard is no longer actively maintained, [it remains
    a popular framework](/2014/10/crisp-dm-top-methodology-analytics-data-mining-data-science-projects.html)
    for navigating data science projects.

    looking for insight into some particular phenomenon, we need some data to examine,
    the data must be inspected or prepared in some manner, the data is used to create
    some appropriate model, and something is done with the resulting model, be it
    "deployed" or "communicated." Though not quite to the extent of Blitzstein & Pfister''s
    Data Science Process, CRISP-DM''s workflow allows for iterative problem solving,
    and is clearly nonlinear.'

    You can, however, access further information about CRISP-DM on its [Wikipedia
    page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Industry_Standard_Process_for_Data_Mining).
    For those unfamiliar with CRISP-DM, [this visual guide](https://exde.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/crisp_visualguide.pdf)
    is a good place to begin.

    Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro, and Smyth, is a framework which has, at its core, "the

    no.

    Data Science Process and CRISP-DM **may** be viewed as updates to the KDD process.
    To be clear, however, even if this is the case, is does not render them unnecessary;
    the updates to their process presentations may be of benefit to newer generations
    approaching these processes from both the point of view of refreshed and up-to-date
    language, as well as the presentation of a framework which can be viewed as "new"
    and, thus, worthy of attention.

    would say probably not. Sure, it's not a perfect analogy, but the underlying point
    is that in technology, there are often overlaps in tools being employed. People
    are attracted to shiny new things, and to different things, and as such, newly
    packaged terminology can serve both a psychological and practical purpose, even
    if it happened to be exactly, or relatively, the same as one which came before
    it.

    of the KDD Process. And this is not meant with malice or dark undertone; it has
    not been typed in the accusatory or with wagging finger. This is simply a statement
    of a simple fact: that which comes before influences that which comes after. In
    the end, any framework or process or series of steps which we take to do data
    science, as long as it works for us and provides accurate results, is worthy of
    being used. Even if this happens to be the Data Science Process, or CRISP-DM,
    or the KDD Process, or whatever steps you take when you enter a Kaggle competition,
    or your boss asks you to cluster some data on widgets, or you try your hand at
    the latest deep learning research paper.'
