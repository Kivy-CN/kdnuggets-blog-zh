    for a long time, which explains why so many folks are wondering how to get into
    data analytics. Since the internet and the widespread adoption of smartphones,
    insane amounts of data are created all the time. The amount of data in the world
    at the start of 2020 was estimated to be [44 zettabytes](https://seedscientific.com/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/)
    at the start of 2020, or 44 x [10^21 bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte_Era).
    All of this data contains vast amounts of quite useful information, like purchasing
    patterns of consumers or indicators of diseases.

    them. What are the numbers saying, and what should the company do about it? A
    simple example is the banner of products that appear after you’ve put an item
    in your shopping cart containing products that customers often purchase together
    with it. A data analyst could be responsible for determining which products should
    be associated with each other in order to increase conversion rates.

    analyzing raw data to find trends and answer questions. It involves a lot of solo
    work in front of the screen, but if you like math and programming, it’s a great
    opportunity for you. You get to procure and gather data as well as clean, organize,
    visualize, and analyze it.

    a data scientist is responsible for designing and constructing new models for
    data. They create prototypes, algorithms, predictive models. A data analyst does
    what the name implies - she looks at data, tries to predict trends, makes visualizations,
    and communicates the results. In other words, data analysts analyze data. Data
    scientists earn $30K-$40K more per year than data analysts in the U.S., so it’s
    an important distinction.'

    you understand the field. Data analytics is the art of making sense out of vast
    amounts of data. According to [DOMO](https://www.domo.com/solution/data-never-sleeps-6),
    since 2020, 1.7MB of data has been created every second for every person on earth.
    It’s the task of a data analyst to find the data that is relevant to their business
    application, make sense of it, and find ways to apply that knowledge to improve
    the business.

    work. Often, data analysts will step through all of these forms of analysis to
    get the most out of a dataset and optimize their business impact. If you want
    to get into data analytics, it’s important that you understand these different
    forms of analysis and know-how to apply them.

    Since it is straightforward to collect data, data analysts can test out their
    hypotheses and correct the prescriptive models they make to improve their performance
    and tweak the action items created from their data insights. Making hypotheses
    based on data, implementing your predictions, and analyzing the results is how
    to get into data analytics.

    extremely technical field. You have to use a lot of different tools and [technical
    skills](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/most-in-demand-data-science-technical-skills/) together
    in order to get the job done. One software engineer, Margarita Hamacher, put together
    a comprehensive list of [7 technical skills](https://margarita-hamacher.medium.com/7-crucial-technical-skills-for-data-analysts-e56525b648b0) for
    data analysts. Data analytics is more than just hard skills. But for anyone wondering
    how to get into data analytics, those technical skills would be a good place to
    start.
  prefs: []

- en: These skills include math, data visualization, machine learning, coding, and
    more. The math requirement can be further broken down into linear algebra, statistics,
    and probability, which are all really important theoretical building blocks for
    data analysts. It’s worth highlighting the importance of how to separate data
    for training and testing and enumerating the basic machine learning algorithms
    you should be comfortable using if not implementing.

    master all of these skills since you will need each of them to properly understand
    the data and accurately analyze it. Additionally, a lot of these skills are absolutely
    fair game for interview questions.

    economic theories are based on the assumption that human individuals make rational
    decisions. This assumption is false, and therefore makes a lot of classical economic
    theories entirely obsolete. For example, one old economic theory is that consumers
    relish choice, and while that holds true in some scenarios, making a decision
    can be physically exhausting, and Mark Lepper and Sheen Iyengar discovered the
    paradox of choice. They found that customers were more likely to purchase a jam
    if they were presented with 6 options instead of 24\. Economic theories based
    on data, however, are far more accurate. Data analytics will still require a few
    small assumptions every now and then, but since it is based entirely on the data
    that is gathered, if your data is comprehensive and representative, data analytics
    offers an elegant and accurate way to understand the world and the decisions or
    habits made in it.

    is the contextual business knowledge you will need. If you are a data analyst
    working with tree growth data and certain values are missing from your dataset,
    you need to know enough about trees and the ways they grow to determine whether
    that data can be thrown out or what the best way to supplement it would be. You
    also need to be able to understand what the features of a dataset mean. If you
    have two features that are very similar in terms of what they mean, you may want
    to throw one out. You can save yourself the trouble of doing an in-depth analysis
    of feature dependence by using your context knowledge to evaluate the dependency
    between features and which ones are most relevant to the problem at hand.

    data analytics. Maybe you have a passion for rescuing animals. You could create
    a model that predicts what strategies are most effective for getting animals adopted.
    It’s even better if you get the chance to apply your model, like if you got an
    animal shelter to follow your recommended strategies and see if that makes a difference
    in adoption rates. Data analytics can be applied to any area where there is data.
    There’s sure to be a dataset that relates to a topic you are passionate about.
    Practice your skills as a data analyst on it so you can highlight them for your
    interviewers.
