- en: The short answer is yes. As long as there is ‘data’ in data scientist, Structured
    Query Language (or see-quel as we call it) will remain an important part of it.
    In this blog, let us explore data science and its relationship with SQL, including
    answers to the 5 Ws and 1 H – how, why, where, when, who and what. We will also
    learn the basics of Database Management Systems (DBMS) and understand how being
    a data scientist could be the best choice for your career.

- en: Data science is broad in its perspective and a [data scientist](https://hackr.io/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist)
    requires deep knowledge of one or more of the various streams of mathematics,
    machine learning, computer science, statistical research, data processing and
    of course domain expertise. Each of these streams needs extensive work with data,
    be it collection, analysis or processing. If you are preparing for a data science
    interview, go through these essential [data science interview questions.](https://hackr.io/blog/data-science-interview-questions)

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The digital world is at its peak, and with growing demands and extensive marketing
    strategies data has become the key to all marketing purposes. For example, if
    I want to buy a new phone, I go to online shops like Amazon or Flipkart, browse
    through different brands, put a few in my cart, but decide to buy it later after
    some more research. Internally, the online shop would save my shopping cart and
    browsing history and show me suggestions for more phones when I come back later.
    Even if I don’t buy, the company would send me emails to remind me that my shopping
    cart is "still waiting for me." Data, thus plays the most important role in creating
    a relationship between buyer and seller. The more data customer shells out, the
    more customized a stream is presented to the buyer. This is not just true for
    e-commerce, but data science is proving extremely useful in many other domains
    like healthcare, manufacturing, banking, finance and transport.

    buy the product and leave. Later you realize you want more of the same product
    and come back. You tell your friends how useful and inexpensive the product is
    and they are convinced to buy it too. Manufacturers use this data to understand
    the likes of customers and update their inventory to have more of the products
    that are popular. Further, constant feedback helps them bring improvements to
    their existing product.'

    and data management tools, it can be determined whether or not introducing a green
    fitted sheet would be a good idea, if it will serve the purpose of more customers,
    and bring more profit.'

    handling humongous amounts of data that need to be processed on a regular basis.
    It also acts as an important tool for the right marketing and feedback that data
    science intends to do. For example, if you don’t like a video that Facebook is
    suggesting you – you would say ‘hide this’ and Facebook will immediately ask you
    for a reason. These user preferences also need to be stored somewhere.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though there are [NoSQL](https://hackr.io/blog/nosql-vs-sql) databases that
    offer high performance and speed, SQL databases are still most widely used for
    all practical purposes. There are more developers who understand SQL technology
    and hence the support and documentation are more plentiful. Further, data integrity
    is one key factor that makes SQL stand apart from any NoSQL database, by way of
    the assurance that no duplicates or unauthorized data can enter the system. Also,
    for complex queries and joins, a well-structured relational database works better.

    take a simple example of how you as a data scientist could possibly use SQL to
    collect and analyze data.

    by the author ‘Carl Shan’ by checking how many users ordered a copy of it. Because
    SQL is a well-structured language with a proper schema, you could have a structure
    like this:'

  prefs:

    or keys. In this case, `order_id` is common to all the three tables and using
    this data, we can write a query to fetch the necessary details.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a relational database model, all the data points are related or connected
    to each other. While creating this kind of database, the relationships between
    various tables and columns has to be defined in the design stage itself. In our
    above example, the three tables are related. The customer table’s [primary key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key)
    ("a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes (columns) that uniquely specify
    a tuple (row) in a relation (table)") will be `customer_id`, whereas `order_id`
    will be a [foreign key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key) ("set of attributes
    subject to a certain kind of inclusion dependency constraint, specifically a constraint
    that the tuples consisting of the foreign key attributes in one relation, R, must
    also exist in some other (not necessarily distinct) relation, S"). In the same
    way, the `book_id` and `order_id` combined can be the composite key for book table.
    These relations have to be defined during the creation stage itself.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normalization is the design process where tables in the database are organized
    in such a way to avoid redundancy and dependency of the data. Using normalization
    of different forms, we can divide data into smaller structures and establish links
    between them so that the data is optimally stored. [This nice article](https://hackr.io/blog/dbms-normalization)
    presents information about normalization in a very simple and understandable manner.

    a data scientist. This need will only increase by the day at least for a few decades.
    In addition to the fat package that the industry offers to a data scientist, it
    is the challenge and ever-growing roles that attract professionals towards this
    job. From data administrator, data architect, data analyst, business analyst to
    a data manager or business intelligence manager, there are plenty of opportunities
    to choose within the data science circle. Knowledge of SQL, programming languages
    like R and Python, statistics and applied math, paired with critical thinking
    and industry knowledge will get you there sooner than you would think.
