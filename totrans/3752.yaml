- en: This is a collection of 5 resources for the uninitiated, which should open eyes
    to what is possible and the current state of the art at the intersection of NLP
    and deep learning. It should also provide some idea of where to go next. Hopefully
    this collection is of some use to you.

    given at the Machine Learning Summer School in Lisbon. You'll find it to be a
    solid primer for both NLP and deep learning, as well as deep learning for NLP.
    Expect no magic.

- en: Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) are typically associated with Computer Vision.
    CNNs are responsible for major breakthroughs in Image Classification and are the
    core of most Computer Vision systems today. More recently CNNs have been applied
    to problems in Natural Language Processing and gotten some interesting results.
    In this paper, we will try to explain the basics of CNNs, its different variations
    and how they have been applied to NLP.

    language processing research, in an attempt to bring natural-language researchers
    up to speed with the neural techniques. The tutorial covers input encoding for
    natural language tasks, feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, recurrent
    networks and recursive networks, as well as the computation graph abstraction
    for automatic gradient computation.

    fields (NLP included) in which they have only a very superficial understanding,
    and make broad and unsubstantiated claims without taking the time to learn a bit
    about the problem domain.

    learning applied to NLP. On the model side we will cover word vector representations,
    window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory
    models, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks as well as some
    recent models involving a memory component.

- en: This is an advanced course on natural language processing. Automatically processing
    natural language inputs and producing language outputs is a key component of Artificial
    General Intelligence. The ambiguities and noise inherent in human communication
    render traditional symbolic AI techniques ineffective for representing and analysing
    language data. Recently statistical techniques based on neural networks have achieved
    a number of remarkable successes in natural language processing leading to a great
    deal of commercial and academic interest in the field.
