    to *Substantive Expertise*: "**You keep using that word. I do not think it means
    what you think it means**." Malak split it into *Domain Expertise*, and...er,
    knowledge of a domain, like *Social Sciences.* Maybe I''m dense, but I don''t
    get the distinction. I''m also not sure what he''s getting at with *Holistic Traditional
    Research* that, unlike *Traditional Research*, according to its placement doesn''t
    include knowledge of the science you''re researching? Am I reading that wrong?
    Holistic science [is a thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism_in_science),
    but it''s not *that* thing. Anyways, *Data Science* is once again back in the

    as such, *Data Science* is one of the circles, with other expertises (often not
    residing in the same person, but hopefully on the same team) being *IT Skills* and *Business
    Skills*. It kinda bothers me that the text labels are pointing to very specific
    positions in each slice, but the actual positions are arbitrary. That's business
    infographics for you.

    Really Hard? *And yes, that's what a four-set Venn diagram looks like, not four
    circles like Malak's above, which does not contain all the combinations of intersections.

    to be a Venn diagram of data science, (a) it's not a Venn diagram, and (b) Data
    Science is *inside* one of the circles. It's good to see Big Data acknowledged,
    though. But...**Calibri**? Really? You went with the default font?

    exact skills, but it really is a synergy of different disciplines. Unfortunately,
    skill in one discipline can sometimes mask serious deficiencies in another and
    give data science a bad name. (I may or may not have contributed somewhat to this
    phenomena in my misspent youth, like, last year.)
