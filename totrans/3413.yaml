    be resting in peace. The iconic photos taken by the Argo, a cutting-edge deep
    ocean mapping vessel, ended the debate. Similarly, until recently, the age of
    the universe was uncertain. By showing the universe''s expansion rate, the Hubble
    telescope provided an estimate: 13.75 billion years.'

    quite "noisy"), and then A.I. and machine learning were used to find various patterns.
    (Fun thought: it would have taken a person 12 years to merely listen to the calls.)'

    in February." Or "probably by end of Q1." There was high correlation between mentions
    of this word and the deal timing. In fact, we found that timing forecasting accuracy
    was as high as 73% when the client used the word “probably” in conjunction with
    the timing. Now, before you get too excited, I do need to caution you: this is
    correlation, not causation. We do understand the difference, right? :) And it
    does not mean that the deal will close. Only that if it does, the timing is probably
    on the mark.'

    thought that "probably" is slightly negative. Who would have guessed that this
    word is actually a positive signal? That''s the power of machine learning: facts,
    not opinions.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Since this is correlative, one can only speculate why that is: "We need this
    yesterday," is not a very thoughtful answer and does not really mean much. Ditto
    for "Sometime next year I believe." But "probably in March" is a more cautious,
    thoughtful answer. So there''s a better chance they mean it.'

    out."* As in "We need to figure out our strategy around..." or "I need to speak
    with the team and then we need to figure out..." especially when wrapping up a
    call and discussing next steps.

    a hurdle, so be attuned. And you’ll probably want to estimate the deal’s probability
    of closing on the lower end of your usual range.

    once we saw it, it made perfect sense. Another Argo moment.
