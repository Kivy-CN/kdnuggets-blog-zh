- en: Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses the scientific method,
    processes, and algorithms to extract knowledge and insights from data. The field
    of data science has several subdivisions, such as data mining, data transformation,
    data visualization, machine learning, deep learning, etc. In this article, we
    will focus on how to ask meaningful questions that could be answered using data.
    The quality of any analysis performed on data depends on your ability to frame
    the right questions. The following tips will help you to frame the right questions
    to be addressed with data.

    to explore the available data carefully. This would help you understand the scope
    of the data, its quality, its type (ordinal or categorical; static or dynamic),
    patterns in the data, and relationships between features in the data.'

    on your dataset, the problem to be solved could fall under one of the following
    categories: descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, or prescriptive analytics.
    These three categories of data science tasks will be discussed in greater details
    in the case studies section below.'

    not have domain knowledge about the system of interest. For instance, depending
    on the organization you are working for, you may have to work with a team of engineers
    (industrial dataset), doctors (healthcare dataset), etc., in order to figure out
    predictor features and target features to use in your model. For example, an industrial
    warehouse system may have sensors that generate data in real-time to track operations
    in the warehouse. In this case, as a data scientist, you may not have technical
    knowledge about the system in question. So, you would have to work with engineers
    and technicians for them to guide you to decide what features are of interest
    and what are the predictor variables and the target variable. Teamwork is, therefore,
    essential to piece together different aspects of the project. From my personal
    experience working on an industrial data science project, my team had to work
    with system engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, field engineers,
    and technicians over a period of 3 months just to understand how to frame the
    right questions to be solved with the available data. Such a multidisciplinary
    approach to problem-solving is essential in real-world data science projects.'

    features in your dataset. Data visualization plays an essential role here. You
    need to decide the type of data visualization that is suitable for the project
    at hand. It could be a scatter plot, barplot, line graph, density plot, heat map,
    etc. Some examples of data visualization projects are presented below.

- en: In predictive analysis, the goal is to build a model using available data that
    can then be used for making predictions on unseen data. Here, the type of model
    to build will depend on the type of target variable. If the target variable is
    continuous, then one can use linear regression, and if the target variable is
    discrete, then classification could be used. The framework for prescriptive data
    analysis is illustrated in Figure 6 below.

    categories so that calls can be answered by personnel with the right expertise,
    model to predict if a loan will charge off (default) after the duration of the
    loan, model to predict the price of a house based on different features or predictors,

    regression, logistic regression, KNN, SVM, k-means, Monte Carlo simulation, time
    series analysis, etc. The dataset has to be divided into training, validation,
    and test sets. Hyperparameter tuning is used to fine-tune the model in order to
    prevent overfitting. Cross-validation is performed to ensure the model performs
    well on the validation set. After fine-tuning model parameters, the model is applied
    to the test dataset. The model’s performance on the test dataset is approximately
    equal to what would be expected when the model is used for making predictions
    on unseen data.

    improving the customer experience or increasing productivity or deciding if a
    bank should approve credit to a borrower, etc. The model is evaluated in a production
    setting in order to assess its performance. This can be done by comparing the
    performance of the machine learning solution against a baseline or control solution
    using methods such as A/B testing. Any mistakes encountered when transforming
    from an experimental model to its actual performance on the production line has
    to be analyzed. This can then be fed back into the original model and used in
    fine-tuning the model to increase its predictive power.

    on your ability to frame the right questions. It is, therefore, important that
    the right questions be framed before using data to perform any type of analysis.
