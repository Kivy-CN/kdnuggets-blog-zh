- en: Today's enterprises rely on machine learning-powered predictions to guide business
    strategy, such as by forecasting demand and mitigating risk. For an increasing
    number of businesses, machine learning (ML) predictions underpin their core business
    model, like [financial institutions that use ML models](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f3a4b1bd19bbb2dbf48b659/5fbfa9e940810b298c02b4b5_Credit%20Score%20Underwriting.pdf)

    IT, models risk degrading the moment they are pushed into production – where the
    hyperdynamic nature of the data meets the hypersensitivity of the models. These
    “drifts” in the data structure, or other properties that cause model degradation,
    are too often silent and unobservable.

    companies struggling to fix corrupted, business-critical models. One of the most
    documented of such issues was Instacart, whose inventory prediction model’s accuracy
    declined from [93% to 61%,](https://fortune.com/2020/06/09/instacart-coronavirus-artificial-intelligence/)
    leaving a sour after-taste for their customers and their teams.

    2” , the day their models meet the real world; as they invest the majority of
    their time researching, training, and evaluating models. While it’s clear that
    teams want to address any potential issues before they arise, there is a lack
    of clear processes, tools and requirements for production systems. Today, the
    industry still lacks guidelines of what an optimal ML infrastructure should look
