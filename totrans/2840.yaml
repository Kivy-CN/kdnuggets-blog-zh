    of algorithms making the student more familiar with scikit-learn and few other
    packages. The theoretical explanation is elementary, so are the practical examples.
    ML-az is the right course for a beginner to get the motivation to dive deep in
    ML. From here, you can choose where to go and, therefore, master it! In short,
    very introductory, no-brainer, wide coverage. A good way to start. *- Denis Mariano*
