    agility to data pipelines, thereby enhancing the quality of data and delivery
    practices. **[DataOps enables](https://www.sigmoid.com/data-devops/)** greater
    collaboration within organizations and drives data initiatives at scale. With
    the help of **[automation](https://www.sigmoid.com/case-studies/property-claim-estimation/)**,
    DataOps improves the availability, accessibility, and integration of data. It
    brings people, processes, and technology together to deliver reliable and high-quality
    data to all stakeholders. Rooted in the agile methodology, DataOps aims at offering
    optimal consumer experience by continuous delivery of analytic insights.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DataOps is often considered DevOps applied to data analytics. However, DataOps
    is more than just that. It also combines key capabilities of data engineers and
    data scientists to offer a robust, process-driven structure to data-focused enterprises.
    DevOps combines software development and IT operations to ensure continuous delivery
    in the systems development lifecycle. Whereas, DataOps also brings niche capabilities
    of key contributors in the data chain – data developers, data analysts, data scientists,
    and data engineers – to ensure greater collaboration in the development of data
    flows.  Also, while comparing DataOps and DevOps, it is worth noting that DevOps
    focuses on transforming the delivery capability of software development teams
    whereas DataOps emphasizes the transformation of analytics models and intelligence
    systems with the help of data engineers.

- en: Data engineers play an important role in ensuring that data is properly managed
    across the entire analytics trail. Additionally, they are entrusted with the responsibility
    of optimal use and safety of data.  DataOps help facilitate the key functional
    areas of data engineers by enabling them with end-to-end orchestration of tools,
    data, codes, and organizational data environment. It can boost the collaboration
    and communication within the teams to adapt with evolving customer needs. In simple
    terms, DataOps strengthens the hands of data engineers by offering greater collaboration
    between various data stakeholders and helping them achieve reliability, scalability,
    and agility.

    engineer. The DataOps engineer meticulously defines and manages the environment
    in which the data is developed. The role also includes offering guidance and design
    support to data engineers around workflows. As far as **[advanced enterprise analytics](https://www.sigmoid.com/ebooks-whitepapers/data-engineering-overcome-challenges-in-enterprise-analytics/)** is
    concerned, DataOps engineers play a significant role in automating data development
    and integration. With their in-depth knowledge of software development and agile
    methodologies, DataOps engineers contribute to enterprise analytics by tracking
    document sources through metadata cataloging as well as building metric platforms
    to standardize calculations. Some of the key roles of a DataOps engineer are:'

    organizations are learning more about it every day. However, with technological
    innovations, a number of platforms have already made a mark and are growing their
    impact across the industry. Here are some of the popular platforms used by DataOps
    teams.

    combine multiple docker containers into a single unit. This makes the development
    process much faster and simple. **[Kubernetes](https://www.sigmoid.com/blogs/containerization-of-pyspark-using-kubernetes/)** can
    help teams manage data scheduling on nodes within a single cluster, simplify workloads
    and categorize containers into logical units for easy discovery and management.

- en: The ELK Stack of Elastic is a widely preferred log management platform which
    comprises three distinct open-source software packages – Elasticsearch, Logstash
    and Kibana. While Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database that runs on Lucene search
    engine, Logstash is a log pipeline solution that accepts data inputs from multiple
    sources and performs data transformations. Kibana on the other hand, is essentially
    a visualization layer which operates on top of elastic search.

    manage and store version updates in data files. It can control and define a particular
    data analytics pipeline such as source code, algorithms, HTML, parameter files,
    configuration files, containers and logs. Since these data artefacts are simply
    source code, Git makes them easily discoverable and manageable.
