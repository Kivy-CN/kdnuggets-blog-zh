- en: Data powers everything we do these days. And that means how we accumulate, disseminate,
    study, store and act upon data is one of the most important jobs out there. That
    must be why data science is such a booming business — one that’s [expected to
    reach $16 billion in value by 2025](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/big-data-analytics-to-become-16-billion-industry-by-2025/articleshow/59410695.cms).

    you’ll acquire as a data scientist are extremely valuable and could see you employed
    with companies as diverse as IBM, Coca-Cola, Ford Motors and Uber, as well as
    countless pro-social and nonprofit endeavors aimed at building a better world.

    a mark on with an education in data science.

    technology improves and developed and developing nations recommit themselves to
    public health, all manner of health-related industries will require data scientists
    — including biotechnology.

    reason: We stand on the verge of unlocking the secrets of the human genome. Doing
    so requires [an almost unimaginable amount of data to accomplish](http://www.mastersindatascience.org/industry/biotech/),
    but once we crack it, we’ll see an explosion of renewed research and development
    in treatment methods, medical devices and much more.'
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a data scientist in this field, you’d help develop new ways to study massive
    amounts of data — including interactive and semantic technologies and even machine
    learning. Work done at this level will influence which treatments, technologies
    and drugs go on to more widespread testing and, ultimately, store shelves.

    to powering our world rely on data — and lots of it. Whether we’re exploring new
    ways to extract energy and mineral wealth from the earth, dreaming up newer and
    safer ways to store and transport crude oil or doing the responsible thing and
    building better and cheaper solar panels, data scientists are in high demand in
    the energy sector.

- en: It’s that last industry — solar power — that has so many people excited about
    pursuing data-rich careers in energy. Cleaner energy production, delivered by
    solar and wind farms, is clearly the future, as evidenced by the success of most
    of the Nordic countries, where [targets of 100 percent sustainable energy are
    common](https://phys.org/news/2017-01-nordic-countries-energy-transition-worth.html).

    and refining clean energy production facilities requires data about the natural
    environment and the needs of modern construction. Data scientists are also frequently
    called upon to improve safety and [help companies commit to new safety and environmental
    regulations](http://www.mastersindatascience.org/industry/energy/).

- en: When companies get sloppy, everybody suffers. But building a better mousetrap
    — or any other product, really — means you need to stay connected with all kinds
    of meaningful data. Ever have your favorite app ask you, pretty please, for a
    review? That’s a kind of crowd-sourced quality control. The numerical rating you
    assign and the positivity or negativity of your review are the data being collated.

    If you’re [doing something like source inspection](http://www.nts-unitek.com/),
    you might be called upon to look at data concerning production methods, bottlenecks
    and areas of persistent inefficiency. Your keenly trained eyes can make sense
    of usage and breakage patterns, streamline production and transportation and ultimately
    deliver insights that deliver better and safer products to the world, faster.

    pretty extraordinary changes. As an example, with a single product announcement,
    Tesla managed to [turn the entire trucking industry on its head](https://futurism.com/teslas-upcoming-semi-truck-could-prompt-huge-changes-in-the-haulage-industry/)
    by unveiling a long-haul truck that can drive itself. They’re not the first to
    make such a promise — this future has been a long time coming. But now it’s here
    and we’re living in it.

    industry is also eyeing ever-more-efficient ways to store and transport energy.
    These breakthroughs entwine closely with a turbulent regulatory environment and
    the development of better battery technology. In short, every sector in the very
    large and very important transportation industry looks to benefit from skilled
    data scientists.

    via blockchain and a host of other technologies](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/08/the-future-is-a-decentralized-internet/)
    that aren’t currently household terms, but soon will be.

    data science will be as we continue to develop the Internet into what it was always
    meant to become: a unifying, civilizing and democratizing communication medium.
    When we need to know how to tell people about a new product, we call on user data.
    When we need to figure out where to bury new fiber-optic cables, we need environmental
    data. We rely on data scientists to design and roll out more energy-efficient
    server farms.'

    to the Internet. And the Internet isn’t possible without the free exchange of
    information and meaningful data. And though some folks might [play at erasing
    knowledge from the world](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/rogue-scientists-race-save-climate-data-trump/)
    by purging it from the Internet, they must know by now they live in a world where
    that’s not really possible.
