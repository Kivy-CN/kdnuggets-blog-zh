- en: Although data engineer (DE) was [the fastest-growing tech job role in 2019](https://techhub.dice.com/Dice-2020-Tech-Job-Report.html),
    there aren’t many online resources on what to expect in a data engineering interview
    and how to prepare for it.

    companies in the Bay Area and helped many connections succeed in their interviews.

    engineering interviews: your resume, programming, SQL, and system design. I will

    I believe is key to a successful job interview but is often ignored by candidates.'

    be ready to discuss in-depth with the interviewers in order to demonstrate your
    skills, including technical competency, problem-solving, teamwork, communication,
    and project management.
  prefs: []

- en: The most common mistake I have seen in resume deep dive sessions is focusing
    solely on the technical implementation details without explaining or understanding
    the trade-offs made in system design (e.g., “I used Kafka because my manager told
    me so”) and the bigger picture of the project. Keep in mind the interviewers don’t
    know your previous company’s business problems, and data infrastructure like you
    do, so you need to provide enough context to help them understand the technical
    complexity and the impact of your projects. Therefore, the key to a great project
    deep dive is to paint a full picture of your project from end to end, like a story!

    them on your resume. Numbers will showcase the scale, impact, and your deep understanding
    of the project. They also make your project more believable. (In fact, interviewers
    might find it suspicious if you can’t even tell how much data your applications
    can process.)

- en: 'Alright. Here comes the most unpleasant part of all software engineering interviews:
    the coding interview, where you are asked to implement complex algorithms (that
    you will probably never need at work) using the most efficient data structures
    in the fewest lines of code possible and explain the time and space complexity
    of your code, all within 30 minutes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The coding interview for data engineer roles is usually lighter on the algorithm
    side but heavier on the data side and the interview questions are usually more
    practical. For instance, write a function to transform the input data and produce
    the desired output data. You will still be expected to use the most optimal data
    structures and algorithms possible and gracefully handle all the potential data
    issues. Since data engineers don’t just use the built-in libraries to process
    data in the real world, the coding interview might also require you to implement
    solutions using popular open-sourced libraries, such as [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
    You are generally allowed to look up documentation during the interview if needed.
    If the job requires proficiency in specific frameworks, be prepared to use those
    frameworks in your coding interviews.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coding in an interview is much harder than coding at work because you will be
    under the pressure of producing your best lines of code within a very short time.
    (I know how scary it feels when your mind just goes blank during an interview.)
    I highly recommend practicing some (but not too many) coding questions on programming
    websites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and
    get yourself comfortable with writing code on a [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL is such a critical skill for data engineers that I need a separate section
    for it (plus SQL is not really a programming language). In fact, it is very common
    to have a SQL interview in addition to a coding interview. As data engineers are
    responsible for building reliable and scalable data processing and data modeling
    solutions, you should be better at SQL than data analysts and data scientists
    (who mainly use SQL to query production-ready data) so you need to know much more
    than just “SELECT…FROM…”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What? Isn’t SQL just a query language? What else should I know about SQL?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, SQL is beyond just a query language. It is also a data processing
    pattern shared by many big data frameworks, such as SparkSQL, pandas, KafkaSQL,
    etc. Therefore, proficiency in SQL also indicates you can efficiently learn and
    work with these frameworks too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good data engineer should be capable of translating complicated business questions
    into SQL queries and data models with good performance. In order to write efficient
    queries that process as little data as possible, you need to understand how the
    query engine and optimizer work. For example, sometimes using CASE statements
    combined with aggregation functions can replace JOIN and UNION and process much
    less data.

- en: Data models have a large impact on how to structure your queries. For instance,
    always take advantage of table partitions and indexes whenever possible. But data
    models are also largely dependent on query patterns. To design a good data model,
    you need to be able to translate business questions into SQL queries that end-users
    will run against your tables. This is why SQL and data modeling interviews often
    go side by side. (I will talk more about data modeling in the next section.)

    technical interviews. In a system design interview, you will design a data solution
    from end to end, which is usually composed of three parts: data storage, data
    processing, and data modeling.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initial interview question is often very short and abstract (e.g., design
    a data warehouse from end to end), and it’s your job to ask follow-up questions
    to pin down the requirements and use cases, just like solving a real-life data
    problem. The main challenge of system design is to choose the best combination
    of data storage systems and data processing frameworks based on those requirements
    and use cases, and sometimes there is more than one optimal solution. The key
    to nailing a system design interview is to understand key principles and concepts
    in data engineering and trade-offs of a variety of data systems and frameworks. [Designing
    Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) is
    a must-read if you want to build a solid foundation in data system design.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data modeling is usually the end piece of a system design interview, but sometimes
    it is a part of the SQL interview instead. One example of a data modeling interview
    question is to design the backend analytical tables for a reservation system for
    vet clinics. The most important principle in data modeling is to design your data
    models based on use cases and query patterns. Again, it is your responsibility
    to get clarifications on the requirements and use cases so that you can make better
    design choices.
