  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ETL is the process of moving data from multiple sources to bring it to a centralized
    single database. The raw data is EXTRACTED from the source, TRANSFORMED on a separate
    processing server and LOADED into the target database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason why Transform occurs before Load is due to the data that has been
    Extracted need to conform to the data regime of the target database. For example,
    there are some data warehouses that can only accept SQL-based data structures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ETL method ensures compliance in a sense that the data Extracted is Transformed
    in the correct data form to the target database. If the Extracted data is not
    Transformed correctly, it will not move and load into the data warehouse successfully.

- en: What is ELT?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ELT does not require the raw data to be transformed in order for it to be loaded.
    The raw data is loaded into the data warehouse and the aim of transformation,
    data cleaning, etc occur in the data warehouse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the data is left in its raw format in the data warehouse, this allows for
    different types of transformation and analytics to occur.

- en: ELT is fairly new to the tech industry, with its development occurring due to
    scalable cloud-based data warehouses. Therefore, as years go on and more companies
    adopt cloud infrastructure, you can see the ELT process also becoming more popular.
