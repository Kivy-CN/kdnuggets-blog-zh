    a computer to perform tasks that are usually done by humans, using data, machine
    learning, and more. You can use AI to create content, answer questions, and generate
    life-like art.

    prioritize and complete tasks by themselves. It is achieved by self-directed instructions
    which run on a loop to produce actions at each iteration.

    gold-standard knowledge of their training data, but also be able to gather and
    interpret data from a variety of sources.

    you remember it? An autonomous AI agent will need the capability to not only learn
    about new data, but they will also need to be able to recall past experiences.

- en: Autonomous AI agents use techniques such as reinforcement learning - a type
    of machine learning concerning the training of models and their ability to produce
    a sequence of decisions, to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Using reinforcement
    learning allows models to improve by providing feedback, refining strategies,
    and producing successful outputs through trial and error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to improve the learning of autonomous AI agents is by communicating
    with other systems, and users to provide an exchange of information and collaboration.
    Browsing external sources such as databases also enhances the learning process
    by providing knowledge resources to help the autonomous AI agent in the decision-making
    process.

- en: When you have a good knowledge base and memory, it helps in your decision-making
    process. For autonomous AI agents, decision-making requires the system to analyze
    data, go through their memory, weigh out the different options and select the
    most suitable action for the user's goal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another element to take into consideration is that autonomous AI agents may
    be prompted to develop detailed action plans which require a lot of planning -
    which is vital before they execute their decision-making process.
