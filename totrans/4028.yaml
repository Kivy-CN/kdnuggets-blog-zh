- en: It’s 2024, so I shouldn’t need to tell you why you ought to learn Python if
    you’re thinking about doing any kind of coding job. It’s one of the most popular
    programming languages, almost every data science job loves to see it on your resume,
    and it’s one of the easiest languages to learn.

- en: The problem is that Python is a victim of its own popularity. So many people
    know Python, and it has such a reputation for being such a simple language that
    people forget that you’re still learning a coding language at the end of the day.
    It’s easier, relative to, say, Perl, but not *easy*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It doesn’t help that many of the established learning paths have real flaws.
    Bootcamps are popular, but they’re often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.
    Video tutorials are free, but quality varies and they’re not very motivational.

- en: You can start by giving ChatGPT an idea of your learning level. Ask it to do
    a quiz and assign you a level based on your responses. Based on those answers,
    get it to design a lesson plan for a specific time frame – say, a year or six
    months.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is so great because unlike Coursera videos, bootcamps, or YouTube lectures,
    this lesson plan can be designed to your specific level of Python. Skip the essentials
    if you learned them in high school or college, or ask it to really drill you on
    the core ideas if Python is brand new to you.

    well you retained yesterday’s material, or go straight into that day’s lessons
    and practice questions.

    exciting things in the world. But when ChatGPT sets you a test question, you then
    answer it – and it will tell you if you got it right or wrong.

    test questions from earlier on in your learning journey.

- en: Another advantage is the engagement level. Video lectures can’t tell you your
    code is wrong, but ChatGPT can. It can also teach you why. One thing I love about
    ChatGPT-based lesson plans is that you can ask it to use the Socratic method of
    teaching, which is extremely interactive, engaging, and good at getting you to
    grasp new concepts. For example, you might get something wrong in one of your
    ChatGPT-administered tests. Instead of telling you the right answer, ChatGPT can
    walk you through how to get to the right answer using Socratic teaching.

    that are highly recommended by Reddit users. Tutory takes it a step further with
    session continuity and long-term memory, so ChatGPT will be better at sticking
    to a real lesson plan over time. More and more ChatGPT users are creating plugins,
    so if you’re on the pro version, keep your eyes open for other potentially useful
    plugins.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, you'll need to use an external Python environment for practicing and
    executing code. While you *can* write code inside ChatGPT, and it *will* tell
    you if it would work in theory, I don’t recommend it. It’s always better to run
    your code to see if it actually works as you expect. Plus, ChatGPT can't fully
    replicate the experience of working on larger, real-world projects.
  prefs: []

- en: No Context
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT won’t always understand the full context or intention behind your code,
    either, especially if there are complex issues or bugs. Basic issues are not a
    problem, but the more edge-case your issue, the less likely it is that ChatGPT
    can help.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike video tutorials, vanilla ChatGPT lacks visual aids like diagrams or charts.
    (Though some plugins like Daigr.am do grant it this ability.) Plus, as most people
    know by now, ChatGPT's training includes information only up to a certain point.
    Python doesn’t evolve super quickly, but it’s still possible ChatGPT could be
    missing context, especially for newer libraries.

- en: Fact-Checking Needed
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also worth remembering that ChatGPT might misinterpret your questions or
    provide overly broad answers. It’s also sometimes just plain wrong – it’s good
    to fact-check every so often to make sure you’re not going off-kilter.

    a risk of becoming too reliant on ChatGPT for answers, which can slow your independent
    problem-solving skills. While employers love your Python knowledge, problem-solving
    skills are more important.

    with other learning routes. If it works well to teach you Python basics, you can
    go on to use it to learn other skills, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I would trust ChatGPT to teach Python basics, but being able to demonstrate a
    portfolio of real-world projects is super important, too, and you’ll be on your
    own for a lot of that.

    At best, you might be on your way to learning one of the most popular coding languages
    in 2024.
