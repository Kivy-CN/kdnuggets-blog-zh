- en: SQL, which stands for Structured Queries Language, is the standard language
    for interacting with a database that uses an SQL server. It was created for the
    purpose of manipulating sets of data. It can be used to retrieve, update, delete,
    and create data within a database.

    as adding tables, delete records and setting access permissions.

    as "SELECT" and "FROM." This SQL syntax is standardized by ANSI and ISO-certified,
    ensuring consistency across the hundreds of databases and data tools that support
    SQL today.

- en: SQL dialects are variations of the SQL language tailored to different database
    systems, each impacting compatibility and ease of use. For data professionals,
    learning the differences between SQL dialects such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite
    is highly beneficial.

    can enhance code performance and facilitate seamless integration across various
    platforms.

- en: While it's not necessary to be an expert in every SQL dialect, having a basic
    understanding of the syntax differences is extremely helpful, especially when
    seeking employment in environments that use different dialects. Many learners
    start with SQLite, but it’s advantageous to familiarize yourself with at least
    one other SQL dialect beyond SQLite. This knowledge will make you more versatile
    and better prepared for diverse data environments.
