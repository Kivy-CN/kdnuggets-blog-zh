    than any statistician”. I like to add what I call “The Priestley Corollary” –

    am also frequently asked What’s the difference between a computer scientist and
    a data scientist? The fact that both disciplines question if there is effectively
    anything new here is telling. While both domains are contributing in important
    and meaningful ways to this nascent discipline, neither is independently sufficient.'

    to be data is expanding. For example, text and image are increasingly common forms
    of data to be integrated into analytical methodologies like classification and
    risk modelling. This expanding definition of data is pushing both statistics and
    computer science out of their traditional cores and into their respective fringes
    – and it’s at those fringes where the new thinking is taking place – and the fusion
    of the fringes is forming the basis of Data Science. Much of the traditional core
    of statistics does not readily accommodate problems defined by billions of records
    and/or by unstructured data. Similarly, while the core of computer science enables
    the efficient capture and storage of massive amounts of structured and unstructured
    data, the discipline is ill equipped to accommodate to the translation of that
    data into information through modelling, classification and then visualization.

    the short end of the stick. I think this is unfortunate. A few years ago, there
    was an article on the Simply Statistics blog, “[Why Big Data Is in Trouble: They
    Forgot About Applied Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/2014/05/07/why-big-data-is-in-trouble-they-forgot-about-applied-statistics/)”.
    The article highlighted the issue of how a rush to the excitement of machine learning,
    text mining, and neural networks missed the importance of basic statistical concepts
    related to the behavior of data—including variation, confidence, and distributions.
    Which lead to bad decisions. While Data Science is NOT statistics, statistics
    contributes in a foundational way to the discipline.'

    “Data Science” also has evolutionary seeds in Statistics. In 1962 John W. Tukey
    (one of the best known and respected Statisticians of our time) wrote: “For a
    long time I thought I was a statistician, interested in inferences from the particular
    to the general. But as I have watched mathematical statistics evolve, I have …
    come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis… data analysis is intrinsically
    an empirical science.”'

    Conference of the International Federation of Classification Societies in 1996\.
    The article was titled “Data Science, Classification, and Related Methods”. In
    1997, during his inaugural lecture as the H. C. Carver Chair in Statistics at
    the University of Michigan, Professor C. F. [Jeff Wu](http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/)
    (currently at the Georgia Institute of Technology), actually called for statistics
    to be renamed data science and statisticians to be renamed data scientists.

    first academic, peer review journal dedicated to Data Science – Data Science Journal…followed
    the next year by The Journal of Data Science. Since then several other journals
    have emerged to promote and disseminate academic research specifically in this
    space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The emergence of dedicated academic journals is particularly important to the
    academic community – these journals now provide emerging doctoral programs (like
    ours) and emerging academic departments to establish unique platforms for research,
    scholarship and publication. Now Data Science faculty and doctoral students can
    engage in the production of knowledge and thought leadership within their own
    community – not Statistics, not Computer Science, not Mathematics, not the Business
    School.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My [opinion](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-generation-data-scientists-better-than-you-priestley-ph-d-/)
    is that we don’t need “190,000 people” or “1.5 million managers” who have deep
    analytical skills. I think everyone needs to have some level of analytical skills.
    I think that basic data literacy should be as foundational in our education system
    as reading and math. It’s encouraging to see basic coding skills increasingly
    being taught in elementary schools. At the university level, my opinion is that
    Data Science should be part of the General Education curriculum (right now I can
    hear our Academic Affairs office gasping).

    system that has been misaligned with the demands of the market. Education at all
    levels is still pivoting and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable
    future. I would expect that within a generation, the demand for these skills will
    not diminish, but the supply will be more closely aligned.

    us…and what we need to do to get them ready…but the reality is that there are
    a lot of people in their late 20s, 30s, 40s who are looking for opportunities
    to pivot their career towards Data Science.

    that goes like this “I just paid $10,000 to XX university to complete a certificate
    in Data Science…and I still can’t get a job”. While some of these “certificates”
    are well developed and are good value, sadly, many are not.

    and where they want to go. The answer to that question of course will dictate
    how to get there. Those that fall into the lure of the easy online certificate
    programs should be mindful of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland – “if
    you don’t know where you are going, it really does not matter what path you take”.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (1) If you are a poet and you are looking to get into Data Science – REALLY
    get into Data Science as a career in a deep and meaningful way – you need to put
    away your plumed pen and pull out your jeans and your backpack, and go back to
    school. Full time. Most graduate programs in Data Science are less than two years
    and most offer some form of graduate research assistantship. You should be looking
    for programs that include programming, statistics, modeling. But also ample opportunity
    to work on REAL world projects with local companies, nonprofits, local governments…etc.
    I can’t emphasize strongly enough how critical applied, hands on, real experience
    is to any Data Science program. This is why online/short term certificate programs
    don’t work for people who are starting from scratch in this area. It’s through
    hands on experience that will help people understand the more latent aspects of
    data science – like the role of story telling, creativity (which is woefully underappreciated)
    and project management.
  prefs: []

- en: (2) If you are a computer scientist/programmer, look for a business school program
    with an analytics track or a strong applied statistics program. Presumably your
    coding and math skills are where they need to be – you likely need the statistics/modeling/analytics
    – and the training (again) to tell the story and learn how to work in teams of
    people who think differently than you do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (3) I would encourage everyone/anyone to consider learning basic visualization
    tools like Tableau. I would also encourage anyone/everyone to consider taking
    online/asynchronous programming courses periodically. These are typically inexpensive
    (even free) and enable you to continue to keep your skills sharp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I get the argument that not everyone wants to become a computer programmer –
    I do not particularly enjoy programming. I had to learn to program to get answers
    to the research questions that were posed to me. If I could have found the answers
    using my trusty HP-12C and a mechanical pencil I would have. You have to know
    basic math, you have to be able to read and write and, increasingly, you have
    to be competent in some basic programming in the 21st century.

- en: I frequently give talks at corporate events, where this issue is present in
    the room – even if it is not vocalized. I frame the conversation like this – organizations
    can be roughly categorized as native and non-native to data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples of the “natives” are the companies that dominate the headlines – as
    well as the stock market – Amazon, Google, Facebook. These companies could not
    have existed 30 years ago. Not only did the data that is so foundational to who
    they are and what they do did not exist, but even if it did, we did not have the
    computing power to capture it or to execute the deep analytical methodologies
    related to AI, machine learning, deep learning…that enable them to do what they
    do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, another dimension to these companies that is often overlooked is that
    because they are native to data, this has HUGE cultural implications. These are
    data-driven companies from the top to the bottom of the org chart. They have data
    running through their DNA. Most everyone who comes into these companies has a
    data centric orientation – and likely studied a computational discipline – increasingly
    Data Science. The median age of an employee at Facebook is 29\. At Google, it’s
    also 29 and at Amazon its 30 (not including warehouse employees).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies that are non-native to data are the companies that were successful
    long before we heard terms like “Data Science” and “Big Data.” Examples might
    include Walmart and Arby’s. These are very successful companies that did not initially
    have data running through their DNA. And although these companies now lean heavily
    into data to inform their decision making and delivery of their products and services,
    there is a great deal of variation across the org chart in terms of computational
    literacy. But their leadership has been very forward thinking in terms of making
    these companies leaders in their markets because of the cultural shifts in becoming
    fact-based, data-driven organizations. Others in their respective markets (Sears,
    Macys…McDonald’s, Wendy’s) have not.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m not really an expert in this area, but I would say that any forecasting
    of the death of Statistics, Computer Science or Data Science because of automation
    is premature. Calculators “automated” mathematics…but mathematics is broader and
    more complex now than it was before calculators. I expect that same will be true
    in Data Science.
