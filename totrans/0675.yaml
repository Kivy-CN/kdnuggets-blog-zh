- en: Computer vision software is changing industries and making the lives of consumers
    not only easier but also more interesting. As a field, computer vision has received
    a lot of publicity and a decent amount of investment. The North American market
    for computer vision software has had a total investment of $120 million USD, while
    the Chinese market surged to $3.9 billion USD. Let’s take a look at the most promising
    and more intriguing technologies that make computer vision software development
    market grow so fast.

    results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditional machine learning algorithms, as complex as they may be, are still
    very simple at their core. Their training requires a lot of domain expertise (which
    is expensive), human intervention when errors occur, and in the end, they are
    only good at the task they’ve been trained at.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deep learning algorithms, on the other hand, learn about the task at hand through
    a network of neurons that map the task as a hierarchy of concepts. Each complex
    concept is defined by a series of simpler concepts. And all of this the algorithms
    can do by themselves. In the context of computer vision, this means identifying
    light and dark areas first, then categorizing lines, then shapes before moving
    towards a full picture recognition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deep learning algorithms also perform better when you give them more data, which
    is not typical of machine learning algorithms.

    many more pictures and videos to be used in training of deep learning algorithms,
    but it has also relieved a lot of work connected to annotating and labeling the

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machines that connect to the internet and the cloud are able to learn from the
    data gathered by the network as a whole and adjust accordingly, optimizing the
    system’s performance. However, connection to the internet and the cloud is not
    always a guarantee. That is where edge computing comes in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Edge computing refers to technology attached to physical machines, such as a
    gas turbine, a jet engine, or an MRI scanner. It allows for the data to be processed
    and analyzed where it is collected, as opposed to it being done in the cloud or
    at a data center.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Edge computing doesn’t replace the cloud. It simply allows machines to act alone
    on new data insights when needed. In other words, machines on the edge can learn
    and adjust based on their own experience, independent of the larger network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Edge computing solves the problem of network accessibility and latency. Now
    devices can be placed in areas where a network connection is bad or nonexistent
    without it reflecting on the results of the analysis. Furthermore, edge computing
    can offset some of the costs of usage and maintenance of cloud computing for data
    sharing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For computer vision software, this means a possibility to respond even better
    in real time, and only move relevant insights to the cloud for further analysis.
    This feature is especially useful for autonomous cars.

- en: In order to operate safely, the vehicles will need to gather and analyze vast
    amounts of data pertaining to their surroundings, directions, and weather conditions,
    not to mention communicating with other vehicles on the road, all without latency.
    Replying on a cloud solution to analyze the data can be dangerous as latency can
    lead to accidents.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A technology that has been used more frequently lately in object recognition
    and object tracking is point cloud. Simply put, a point cloud is a collection
    of data points defined within a three-dimensional coordinate system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This technology is typically used within a space (for example a room or a container)
    where the location and shape of each object are represented by a list of coordinates
    (X, Y, and Z). The list of coordinates is referred to as a “point cloud”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This technology provides an accurate representation of where an object is in
    the space, and any movement can be accurately tracked.

    to do with the real one the user is located in. Most AR devices can perform simple
    scans of the environment (Google ARCore can, for example, detect flat surfaces
    and changes in light conditions), and VR systems can detect the movements of the
    user through head tracking, controllers, etc., but their abilities stop there.

    tool. Not only can this tool detect all pixels belonging to objects in the picture,
    but it can also determine what pixels belong to which object and where in the
    picture the objects are located.
