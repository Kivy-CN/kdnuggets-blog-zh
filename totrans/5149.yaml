- en: Since the 1970s, when two IBM researchers, Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin,
    developed a new coding language, the data industry has relied heavily on SQL to
    effectively query and transform data. This became more apparent once data teams
    started transferring their storage and computing over to cloud web servers.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With these changes, it became ever more important for anyone working on the
    analytics side of data to master this language. There is plenty of noise on the
    internet about different cheat sheets offering the most basic SQL transforms.
    Leaning on my years of experience as a data analyst and data scientist, I can
    tell you that very few of these end up helping you in the long run. There are
    truly only two ways to operate effectively with SQL - learn the basics and then
    either continue building your skills or (the more popular) leverage other tools
    to enhance productivity, with the sweet spot being a mixture of both!

    and friends to write the correct SQL queries. With such a strong foundation in
    the concept, it only makes sense that they would have good resources for people
    to learn SQL. Additionally, this resource breaks up the different syntaxes so
    that you only have to work with the program you want to. I recommend using this
    once you better understand the different transforms you are trying to run.

  zh: 现在该怎么办？
- en: Now that you have completed an intro course to SQL and have a basic understanding
    of how queries are structured and the different transforms that are being offered,
    you are at a crossroads. You should have an understanding of what you are trying
    to achieve and how to achieve it but don’t have the time to search through Stackoverflow
    or Google to round out the corners of those specific queries. This is where you
    should find different tools to help you save time and operate more efficiently.
    Below are two of my favorite resources I recommend to any new or aspiring SQL
    user. These resources are being pulled from an article I recently published titled
    [The Top 5 Bookmarks Every Data Analyst Should Have](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/top-5-bookmarks-every-data-analyst-should-have-547a2c9ad1fe).

    as you will no longer need to dig through extensive queries to find the transform
    that is trying to be run; SQL Formatter will instantly format the query in a structured
    way that is easier for both you and your colleague to follow.

    syntaxes for various transformations. In response to this, many SQL users spend
    copious amounts of time searching through past projects or different online resources,
    such as Stackoverflow and forums, looking for answers. For a data practitioner
    who is working at a data-informed business, saving time is almost as important
    as data quality.

    for a SQL query, which lets you customize column names and table structure, choose
    the operation that you want to do, and then it constructs the syntax for you in
    a variety of different “flavors” of SQL.”

    the free courses and then amplify your knowledge/abilities with the other free
