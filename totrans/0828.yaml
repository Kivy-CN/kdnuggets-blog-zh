- en: With the constant development in technology and the use of AI in our everyday
    lives, many are worried about job displacements. Some are even speaking on data
    science dying. Many are saying that machine learning is replacing data science,
    stating that data science is an oversaturated field. With the heavy use of tools
    such as ChatGPT and their use in coding tasks and more, we are questioning if
    data science is dying.

- en: Well no of course. We’re getting more data, which is producing valuable insights
    that drive decisions. These insights can’t be generated from a computer and we
    need them for data science. Machine learning models can be built and with data
    can be used to find valuable insight, but the key element is the need for data
    and what to do with the data.

    scientists! But what has changed?

    of everybody wanting to break into the tech industry. Let's go over some changes
    in data science.

- en: Tasks such as exploratory data analysis which provided great insight have drastically
    changed. It typically required data scientists and data analysts to come in and
    help with the process. However, now with tools such as ChatGPT, and fast courses
    to become a data scientist - everybody believes they can code and are technically
    proficient in Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, that’s not true. If you have the right skill set and are truly proficient
    in programming languages such as Python - you will stand out. Organizations will
    still be seeking highly qualified data scientists to help them get the job done,
    over ChatGPT’s responses and people who did a quick course in data science.

- en: As a data scientist, it will be your job to adapt to the current market. Continuously
    learning and improving your skillset is the way you will remain competitive and
    be truly valued for your skills.

- en: Many people are using ChatGPT to help them with coding tasks. But the important
    thing to understand with ChatGPT is that it can help you build the blocks to your
    full application, but it can’t bring those blocks together to build the whole
    foundation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Organizations will require somebody who understands all the different blocks
    and how they come together. They will be able to piece together all the blocks
    as they understand what each of them does and put them together to build a foundation.
  prefs: []

- en: It doesn’t mean that ChatGPT is not helpful - it is. A lot of programmers are
    making use of ChatGPT to help them with code blocks, which is helping speed up
    their code-writing process. At the same time, it is also helping improve the skills
    of programmers by learning new things and allowing them to be more proficient
    in their coding.

- en: So the key point to take from this is that as a data scientist, you will need
    to know more, if not all. You will need to know each element of data science as
    well as how to build a full application.

- en: There will be a lot of roles in data science, however, the important thing to
    note is that a lot of roles will be merging. Before you may have been the go-to
    person for data analytics, but now you will need to essentially be a jack of all
    trades - and be a master in overall data science. For example, you will be using
    your analytical skills to build applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is that more and more organizations are looking into the
    efficiency of job roles, and how many people they really require. For example,
    should I hire somebody who is good at creating data visualizations and presenting
    them, or should I find a data scientist who can do it all? From a business perspective,
    you know who the company is going to choose.

    that you can be, that you don’t feel like you’re getting pushed out.

    were trying to break into the tech industry with a quick boot camp and a few Jupyter
    Notebook projects. Unfortunately, that is not going to help you with this current
    market. Having a proficient skill set, with years of experience and a high-level
    understanding of data science is imperative.
