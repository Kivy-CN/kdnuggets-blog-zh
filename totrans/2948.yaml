    Competition is tough in the SaaS market where customers are free to choose from
    plenty of providers even within one product category. Several bad experiences
    – or even one – and a customer may quit. And if droves of unsatisfied customers
    churn at a clip, both material losses and damage to reputation would be enormous.

- en: '**Customer churn (or customer attrition) **is a tendency of customers to abandon
    a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business. The percentage
    of customers that discontinue using a company’s products or services during a
    particular time period is called a *customer churn (attrition) rate*. One of the
    ways to calculate a churn rate is to divide the number of customers lost during
    a given time interval by the number of acquired customers, and then multiply that
    number by 100 percent. For example, if you got 150 customers and lost three last
    month, then your monthly churn rate is 2 percent.'

    and paying for services on a recurring basis, notes head of data analytics department
    at ScienceSoft [Alex Bekker](https://twitter.com/alexlbekker), *“Customers *[of
    subscription-driven businesses]* opt for a product or a service for a particular
    period, which can be rather short – say, a month. Thus, a customer stays open
    for more interesting or advantageous offers. Plus, each time their current commitment
    ends, customers have a chance to reconsider and choose not to continue with the
    company. Of course, some natural churn is inevitable, and the figure differs from
    industry to industry. But having a higher churn figure than that is a definite
    sign that a business is doing something wrong.”*

    the data analysis to align their actions. *“For example, if a customer is showing
    signs of churn risk, that’s probably not a great time for sales to reach out with
    information about additional services the customer might be interested in. Rather,
    that engagement should be with the CSM so they can help the customer become re-engaged
    and see value in the products they currently have. Like sales, marketing can engage
    with customers differently depending on their current indication of churn risk:
    For example, non-churn risk customers are better candidates to participate in
    a case study than a customer who is currently a churn risk,” *the expert of HubSpot
    explains. Generally speaking, the strategy of customer interaction should be based
    on ethics and sense of timing. And using machine learning for customer data analysis

    when your users usually churn. It may be the second week, as in the Spotify example,
    or it may be the 11th month of annual subscription. But most likely, you wouldn’t
    want to learn that this subscriber is likely to churn in a month. As you’ll have
    a very small timeframe for re-engagement.

- en: Balancing the time for observations and predictions is actually a tricky task.
    For instance, if an observation window is one month, then a performance window
    for a customer with an annual subscription will be 11 months. It seems that making
    a short event history and long performance windows would be the most beneficial
    for businesses. You take little time for observation and have enough time for
    re-engagement. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always work this way. A short event history
    may not be enough to make reliable predictions, so experimenting with these parameters
    can become a repetitive ongoing process with its trade-offs. Basically, you have
    to define the event history that would be enough for a model to make a justified
    prediction, but still, have enough time to address potential churn.
