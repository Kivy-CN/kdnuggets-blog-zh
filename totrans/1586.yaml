  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although it's valuable to read articles written by data science professionals
    or watch YouTube videos of those people being interviewed, it's ideal if aspiring
    data scientists can have face-to-face conversations with people currently in the
    field.

    through an income-sharing model that allows people who want to become data scientists
    to receive instruction from experienced professionals. Then, if the mentees get
    data science jobs within a certain amount of time, they pay back the mentors with
    a small portion of their first-year salaries.

    go to data science conferences in their areas and sign up for workshops or intimate
    Q&A sessions with experts. There are also opportunities to get insights through
    message boards and Skype conversations.

    crucial. It could help a data scientist-to-be confirm that the career path is
    the right one for them or highlight why another job choice is more appropriate.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrary to what some people may think, there are numerous specializations for
    data scientists to choose. For example, people who [pursue data analytics majors](https://data-analytics.osu.edu/major/specialization)
    at Ohio State University can choose from one of five specializations, ranging
    from business analytics to biomedical informatics.

- en: Outside of academia, it's necessary for people to think about how they could
    beef up their skills to increase the chances of working in certain data science
    roles. Those who are particularly problem-solving oriented may realize they should
    specialize in operations-related data analytics, which involves digging through
    information to determine how to help companies perform better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    analysis. By taking that approach, they'd be equipped to help employers uncover
    patterns that ultimately drive business decisions.

    early stages of their data science careers. The knowledge they gain could help
    them become aware of passions that would otherwise stay hidden.

    may be a goal that's at least a few years away. However, it's valuable to get
    an idea of the companies that typically hire data scientists and the skills candidates
    should have before looking for work.

    numbers of data scientist job postings. Then, as people continue planning their
    careers, they can measure the likelihood of having to move to get the jobs they
    want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The not-recommended alternative to doing this research early is waiting until
    it's time to get a job. Then, people could find out that although they've worked
    hard to reach their goals, they still lack necessary skills or are not prepared
    to relocate even though there are not many data science jobs available near them.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no reason for people to hold off on getting engaged in data science
    programs until they receive a formal education. Online resources exist that let
    [data science learners start projects](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/articles/how-to-start-a-data-science-project-when-you-are-a-beginner)
    when they're still beginners. They can start by browsing the datasets that are
    freely available, then use those as jumping-off points that inspire the questions
    they want to answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that's no problem. There are [premade projects and tutorials online](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/24-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/)
    that pose problems for people to solve. Those possibilities let individuals begin
    getting hands-on experience without investing in expensive tools or training.

    when they make that decision. So, starting a data science career may require learning
    how to balance the duties of one line of work while preparing for another.

- en: Now is an excellent time for them try [getting data science internships](https://365datascience.com/data-science-internship/).
    Many people view internships as paths to their future jobs, and indeed, they can
    be if people impress employers enough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    most internships are valuable even when participants don't directly get job offers
    from them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the length of the internship and the needs a company has, people
    might get to build data visualizations and create reports, among other tasks.
    Doing these things might feel overwhelming at times, but the experience gets individuals
    ready for their futures.

    foundational components, everyone is different. People may not progress in this
    order, and they may not perform all the steps. That's OK, as long as they keep
    their objectives in sight.
