    **interactive agent**, or **Artificial Conversational Entity**) is a [computer
    program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) or an [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)
    which conducts a [conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation) via
    auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly
    simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing
    the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). Chatbots are typically
    used in [dialog systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_system) for various
    practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some
    chatterbots use sophisticated [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
    systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull
    a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern,
    from a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database).”

    So you can add any number of questions in a proper format so that your chatbot
    doesn’t get confused in determining the regex.
