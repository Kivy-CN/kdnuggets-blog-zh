- en: I will be sharing my experience with the best cloud notebooks and explaining
    why they are in the top five. The cloud integrated development environment (IDE)
    or cloud Jupyter Notebooks has changed my whole perspective about working on data
    science projects. These platforms comes with pre-installed Python or R packages
    that are useful for most of the project, and within a few seconds, you are ready
    to start working on the project.

    missing packages. Other than free compute and pre-build environments, cloud notebook
    platforms offer third-party tool integrations, collaborations, and publication
    options. In this blog, we are going to learn about the best features of the top
    five cloud notebooks and how you can use them to improve your current data science
    development stack.

    CPU, 30 hours GPU, and 20 hours TPU per week. Apart from that they provide unlimited
    public and 100 GB private data storage. Kaggle is the ultimate tool for experimenting
    on machine learning projects and sharing the solutions.'

    It is the best cloud notebook platform for any type of data science project. I
    have ranked it 2nd because the platform only provides free CPU. Both Kaggle and
    Deepnote have been improving UI and adding features regularly, so it was hard
    for me to decide on the 1st. Deepnote is a project-based notebook platform that
    offers multiple database integrations and various key features for improving user
    experience. You can experiment on a data science project, create a custom environment,
    live collaboration, and publish your work. Deepnote is one stop-shop for all of
    your data science projects.'

    Most of the repositories or research papers attach links to Google Colab to test
    and validate the results. I think the simplicity and powerful computing make it
    quite attractive for people to share and experiment on machine learning projects.
    You get temporary storage, free but unreliable GPU and TPU, and integration with
    other Google cloud products such as Drive.'

    and it is a high-quality product. The platform is quite simple to navigate. It
    provides 12 hours of free CPU and 4 hours of GPU for every session. The Studio
    Lab architecture and interface is based on Amazon SageMaker Studio with limited
    features. You only get free compute, storage, and all of the capabilities of Jupyter
    lab and its extensions.

    model and data storage, deployment solution, and monitoring. It also provides
    free CPU and GPU for notebooks. The user interface is quite beautiful and it''s
    easy to navigate. Why is it on the 5th? The GPU is not available most of the time
    and the UI is buggy and slow. There are several paid features that are offered
    free by other platforms. Gradients have huge potential to become market leader
    but due to slower updates and development, they are lagging behind.'

- en: DataCamp [Workspace](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace) is another new contender
    in the cloud notebook market. It is interactive and offers all of the Jupyter
    notebook features. You are limited to CPU, but 90 percent of data science projects
    require CPU. The Workspace is part of the DataCamp courses ecosystem, where you
    can work on tutorial projects and participate in competitions. The platform also
    allows you to create a profile and lets you share your notebook in the form of
    articles. I am a big fan of DataCamp, and I think in the future, Workspace will
    be included in the top five due to its simplicity and integration with other DataCamp
    products.
