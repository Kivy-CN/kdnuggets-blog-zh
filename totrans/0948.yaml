- en: Have you ever seen a great-looking dashboard or report that doesn’t do much
    more than just look good? You can’t really figure out the story. It’s usually
    because the developers haven’t picked the right visualizations and organization.
    Picking the right visualization will tell the story that you may never have the
    time or opportunity to tell.

    over the past twelve months. After observing it, the executives come out of the
    meeting conversing about this month’s record high measure. Your point has been
    missed. You didn’t tell a story. This year when virtual meetings are creating
    a bigger challenge to capture and hold the attention of attendees, no one can
    afford to waste time trying to decode the meaning of a visualization.

- en: Great stories have compelling characters, a looming conflict, and well-organized
    narrative arc. Each of your key metrics is a character in the story. Conflict
    arises when one metric threatens to undermine another. In our banking case study,
    a great presentation could begin at the climax of the conflict, drawing attention
    to the pressing problems with liquidity and looming loan defaults with scorecard
    visualizations. Then the narrative arc could loop back to the beginning of the
    trouble showing time trend visualizations of how individual metrics began to change
    as the pandemic unfolded.

- en: Next, you would compare categories to add nuance to the metrics, showing, for
    example, that loan risk has not increased evenly across industries.  This type
    of character development helps build more anticipation to the looming conflict
    as multiple metrics interact, as shown in a scatter plot type visualization. Finally,
    you arrive back at the climax of the conflict, with the audience in heavy anticipation
    to see what you will propose to resolve the situation. The overall presentation
    will leave a powerful effect on the audience due to the combined impact of well-crafted
    narration backed by visual pictures.

    trying to tell its story or do its job. Stephen Few writes that “An effective
    [visualization] is the product not of cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights,
    but rather of informed design: more science than art, more simplicity than dazzle. It
    is above all else, communication.”'

    be how the banker would show staffing levels on the left Y-axis in units of people,
    while showing net profit on the right Y-axis in units of dollars. The combination
    of all these line-based visualizations would set the context for why radical measures
    are needed to deal with unprecedented change.'

    in deposits. These are your story headlines. A **scorecard** could be used to
    emphasize a sharp decline in profit.  By coloring this number in red and letting
    it stand alone, those present at the presentation will understand its importance.

    can’t just hand the assignment to a graphic designer to select a visualization
    based on the look. To make a visualization tell your story, you need the visualization
    type that is built for your purposes.  Learning the concepts outlined in figure
    1 will make for a more powerful and effective story told.
