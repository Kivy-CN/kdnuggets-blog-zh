    would have doubted but I am amazed at the many things I have learned and the milestones
    I have accomplished in the past six months.

- en: First thing I did when I decided to pursue a career in Data Science; I watched
    a couple of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axu4tJl8gbM) and
    researched a lot about the roadmap for a data scientist as well as the best way
    to learn. I wrote down the list of tools I needed to learn and looked for platforms
    I could learn for free. I had initially started with the [IBM Data Science course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) on
    Coursera but ended up spending most of my time learning on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
    courtesy of a scholarship from [Ingressive for good](https://ingressive.org/).

- en: Another thing I did was put myself out there, for accountability's sake. Was
    I scared? Yes, I was very scared because this girl has tried a lot of things and
    stopped midway. But I was determined to see this to the end so I gave myself a
    timeframe, learn the basics in six months. I wasn’t even thinking about getting
    a job in six months, the goal was to learn a lot in six months to help me get
    started in this career path.

    declaring my intention on Twitter and pinned it to my profile so that every day
    I came online and looked at my profile, it will serve as a reminder.

- en: Another thing was to ask for God’s grace and guidance. Yes, I prayed about it
    and I started this journey with God. I am heavy on the GOD factor and I believe
    this is my secret ingredient.

- en: Also, I mapped out a plan that worked for me, the early hours of the morning
    is my best time to read and it was quite easy for me because at this point I didn’t
    have a laptop and I was learning on my phone. My phone is the first thing I pick
    up every morning after saying Thank you Jesus so straight to Datacamp and straight
    into python.
  prefs: []

    and looking forward to more.

- en: Something I learned in the course of this journey is anything is **doable**,
    Once you have the will to learn and you are ready to put in the work, it’s totally
    achievable. On that note, I have stylishly included a challenge for you. I am
    challenging you to show up every day this month, Pick a skill or any tool and
    learn activities for this month and gauge your growth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing I learned is, showing up every day pays, **Consistency** was a
    big key in my journey. I showed up every day for the past six months…I might not
    have studied a lot on some days and gone really hard on others but I always showed
    up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, **hard work** was another determining factor in my six months success
    story. I worked my brains out. When I started my journey I was learning for 11
    hours every day. I would spend at least four hours during the day, at intervals
    though, not at a stretch, learning concepts on my phone. Then I would spend the
    night practicing what I had learned on a borrowed laptop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another tip that really helped me was sharing my journey, coming online every
    day to talk about my journey was a key factor in my growth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also networking with other data professionals in the space and being a part
    of the data community was another key factor, I had a lot of passive mentors on
    Twitter and it influenced my journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the course of my journey, I also learned to accept that burnouts are normal,
    sometimes I wake up feeling very unmotivated and wondering if I am on the right
    path. On such days I don’t push myself too hard, a practice workout on Datacamp
    and that’s all. I don’t hate myself for not going too hard, instead on days when
    I am feeling very motivated, I go the extra mile to make up for lost days.
  prefs: []

- en: There were also days when I felt like a fraud, impostor syndrome hit me hard,
    it felt like I was just studying and didn’t know anything. I had to work on my
    self-confidence. I wrote down lots of self-affirmations and read them out loud
    when I doubted myself.
