- en: I thought I would end off the year with a not-so-serious post about capturing
    the essence of machine learning. In the past, you have undoubtedly explored a
    variety of in-depth and semi in-depth offerings on what machine learning is, and
    explored its relationships to numerous other topics. Starting from some initial
    common point of reference when discussing such complex concepts is always a good
    idea; the problem is, there exist innumerable initial common points of reference
    for a topics such as machine learning.

    let's explore some 30,000 feet definitions of what machine learning is.

    having first appeared in his 1997 book. The sentence has been influential on me,
    personally, as I have referred to it numerous times over the years and referenced
    it in my Master's thesis. The quote also features prominently in Chapter 5 of
    the much more recent and authoritative "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio &
    Courville, serving as the jumping off point for the book's explanation of learning
    algorithms. See Figure 1 below for an interpretation of the so-called Mitchell
    Paradigm.

    machine learning has been defined in the pages of that book.

- en: Machine learning is essentially a form of applied statistics with increased
    emphasis on the use of computers to statistically estimate complicated functions
    and a decreased emphasis on proving confidence intervals around these functions[.]²

- en: Mitchell's definition of machine learning was removed from application; it focused
    on the specific components of the optimization process which is normally associated
    with machine learning, yet it did not prescribe how it should be to approached,
    practically. The definition in "Deep Learning," shown above, is far more prescriptive
    in nature, noting that computing power is leveraged (the use of which is, in fact,
    emphasized) while the traditional statistical concept of confidence intervals
    is de-emphasized.

    Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tool and Techniques," by Witten, Frank & Hall,
    which was the first book on the subject I read comprehensively. Light on math
    but packed with intuition and explanations with a practical bent, "Data Mining"
    was long my go-to (probably biased) suggestion for newcomers to the field of machine
    learning.'

    and attempts to weave together the concepts of learning, performance, and knowledge
    in the contexts of both machine learning and data mining. Tangents are gone off
    on, but a few select quotes from the ride are shown below.

    the explicit knowledge structures that are acquired, the structural descriptions,
    are at least as important as the ability to perform well on new examples. People
    frequently use data mining to gain knowledge, not just predictions.³

    term to machine learning. The third edition of this text, from which this quote
    was taken, was published in 2011, when the term *data mining* had much more traction
    than it does now; removing references to data mining should still lead to a scenario
    where what is written above holds true for machine learning itself.

    philosophical, Witten, Frank & Hall actually did a pretty good job of getting
    somewhat philosophical. It''s actually a helpful few excerpts, however, in that
    it provides a different angle on a machine learning definition: while Mitchell
    focuses on the specific components of the optimization process, and Goodfellow,
    Bengio & Courville lean toward a more prescriptive definition noting the relative
    importance of computing power, this attempt at a definition focuses on what aspects
    of "learning" are analogous and important in the machine learning process. The
    selections also offer an important point which is actually just as practical as
    it is philosophical, in that it is noted, in the final paragraph, that both the
    *acquired* knowledge as well as the ability to *use* this knowledge are important
    aspects of machine learning (see both *training* and *inference*).'

- en: Let's turn to one final text for its attempt at capturing a definition of machine
    learning, "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning," by researcher Christopher
    M. Bishop. Of note, Bishop does not explicitly define the term early on, but does
    a pretty good job of implicitly providing an algorithmic-centric definition of
    machine learning (note that it is discussed in reference to a digit classification
    task).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The result of running the machine learning algorithm can be expressed as a function
    **y(x)** which takes a new digit image **x** as input and that generates an output
    vector **y**, encoded in the same way as the target vectors. The precise form
    of the function **y(x)** is determined during the *training* phase, also known
    as the *learning* phase, on the basis of the training data. Once the model is
    trained it can then determine the identity of new digit images, which are said
    to comprise a *test set*. The ability to categorize correctly new examples that
    differ from those used for training is known as *generalization*. In practical
    applications, the variability of the input vectors will be such that the training
    data can comprise only a tiny fraction of all possible input vectors, and so generalization
    is a central goal in pattern recognition.⁴

    fact the we are discussing supervised machine learning, as opposed to unsupervised
    learning or reinforcement learning (or some other form of machine learning). Second,
    and more importantly, this is the only definition which provides a step-by-step
    treatment of what machine learning entails, however short those steps might be
    in this case. Also of potential interest, the ensuing page and half of Bishop's
    book outlines and incorporates a number of additional machine learning concepts,
    and ties them all together nicely, providing a readable introduction without getting
    bogged down in the math (much of the rest of the book takes care of this).

    it abstractly in relation to the optimization process; another which is more prescriptive
    and notes the importance of computation in machine learning; a third that focuses
    on what aspects of "learning" are analogous and important in the machine learning
    process; and finally one which outlines machine learning from an algorithmic standpoint.
    None are incorrect, yet all are incomplete. It isn''t just semantics; exploring
    what pioneers and esteemed researchers believe to be "machine learning" will expand
    how we come to define it ourselves.'
