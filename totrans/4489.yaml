- en: Jupyter recently announced its first-ever public release of the much-awaited
    visual debugger. Though it is the first release it supports all the basic debugging
    requirements needed to debug and inspect variables, etc.

- en: The Data Science community is relied heavily on Jupyter Notebooks due to its
    ability to easily communicate and share the outcomes in an interactive way.

- en: However, the only concern was the missing visual debugging ability due to which
    people usually had to switch to other available classical IDEs which offer a better
    debugging and code refactoring ability. This feature was much awaited by the data
    science community which is finally released now.

    visual debugger in the existing JupyterLab environment and will also dockerize
    the JupyterLab environment with the visual debugger enabled by default.

    they’re the technological foundation for the cloud-native approach to app delivery.

- en: Problems arise when the supporting software environment is not identical, says
    Docker creator Solomon Hykes. “You’re going to test using Python 2.7, and then
    it’s going to run on Python 3 in production and something weird will happen. Or
    you’ll rely on the behavior of a certain version of an SSL library and another
    one will be installed. You’ll run your tests on Debian and production is on Red
    Hat and all sorts of weird things happen.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Container solves this problem by bundling the environment needed to run the
    application, the dependencies, binaries, all the necessary configurations and
    the application itself into one package. In this way, we no longer need to worry
    about the OS and other environment-specific dependencies as everything is packaged
    in one single independent entity that can run anywhere and everywhere.
