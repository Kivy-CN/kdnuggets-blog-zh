- en: Each company has its own terminology and organization structure for managing
    business technology. The terminology may have evolved for decades, or may be imposed
    by a leader seeking to shape the branding of the departments. The organization
    structure may match industry norms, or may be unique to the special needs of the
    company. But what is common to all organizations is the need to speak a common
    language about what each department or team does, and a consistent effort to bridge
    the gaps between the teams.

- en: The outer functions are equally important to the inner functions, but the outer
    layer plays an enabling role while the inner functions create the core technology
    deliverables. Each function seeks to hire and train specialized experts at the
    core skills for the function.   And often the boundaries between groups grow,
    intentionally due to turf battles, or by accident due to neglected relationship
    building. Friction, delays and inefficiency grow at those intersections.

    effective or innovative without cooperation.

- en: On the outer layer, the Project Management function, for example, could never
    deliver an authoritative capacity plan or IT roadmap without heavy input from
    the other functions. And the security team needs close cooperation to understand
    the costs and priorities for risk management and to create an effective identity
    management scheme. Yet the departments often attempt to do these things alone.

- en: On the inner Venn diagram we have the three key functions of Information Systems,
    Business Analytics, and Software Development. Each of those functions requires
    highly specialize skills, and it is very rare to find a unicorn “full data stack”
    analyst/data engineer/developer. There needs to be active collaboration between
    teams to deploy models, engineer data pipelines and create analytical data stores.

    technology functions will pay dividends over time. One first step is to use these
    diagrams as a communication device to begin the conversation about where those
    boundaries lie and how to bridge them.
