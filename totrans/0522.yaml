    department entails a lot of recruiting — we’ve more than doubled in less than
    a year-and-a-half. As the hiring manager for several of the positions, I also
    read through a lot of CVs. Recruiters [screen through a CV in 7.4 seconds](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ladders-updates-popular-recruiter-eye-tracking-study-with-new-key-insights-on-how-job-seekers-can-improve-their-resumes-300744217.html),
    and after recruiting for several years my average time is pretty fast, but not
    that extreme. In this blog, I’m going to walk you through my personal heuristics
    (‘cheats’) that help me screen a resume. While I can’t guarantee that others use
    the same heuristics, and different roles will differ in the importance of each
    point, paying attention to these points can help you conquer the CV screen stage.
    Additionally, some of these heuristics may not seem fair or could potentially
    overlook qualified candidates. I agree that talented Machine Learning practitioners
    who don’t invest in their CV could get rejected with this screen, but it’s the
    best tradeoff considering the time. Remember, a highly sought-after position may
    attract a hundred or more CVs. If you want an efficient process, the CV screen
    has to be quick.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m going to quickly run through your CV to look at your previous positions
    and see which are marked as ‘Data Scientist’. There are some other adjacent terms
    (depending on the role I’m hiring for), such as ‘Machine Learning Engineer’, ‘Research
    Scientist’ or ‘Algorithm Engineer’. I don’t include ‘Data Analyst’ in this bucket
    as the day-to-day work is typically different from that of a Data Scientist, and
    the Data Analyst title is an extremely broad term.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re doing data science work at your present job and you have some other
    creative job description, it’ll probably be in your best interest to have your
    title changed to a Data Scientist. This can be very true for Data Analysts who
    are de facto Data Scientists. Remember, even if the CV contains descriptions of
    the projects you’ve worked on (and they include machine learning), a title other
    than Data Scientist will add unnecessary ambiguity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, if you’ve undergone a data science boot camp or full-time master's
    in the field, this will probably be considered the beginning of your data science
    experience (unless you worked in a similar role earlier, which will warrant questions
    at a later stage).

    If you can share the business KPIs that your work impacted, that’s a big thumbs-up
    in my book. For example, indicating your model’s improvement in AUC is all right,
    but addressing the conversion rate increase as a result of your model improvement
    means you ‘get it’ — the business impact is what really matters at the end of
    the day. Compare the following alternatives depicting the same work with a different
    emphasis (technical vs. business):'

    For more recent grads, I’ll also look at their GPA and whether they received any
    excellence awards or honors, such as making the Rector’s or Dean’s list. Since
    Data Science is a wide-open field without any standardized tests or required knowledge,
    people can enter the field in various methods. In my last blog, I wrote about
    the [3 main paths taken into the field](https://towardsdatascience.com/3-ways-to-break-into-data-science-6a7a8fd679b3),
    and based on your education and timing, I’ll figure out which one you probably
    took. Hence, the timing helps understand your story — how and when did you transition
    into data science. If you don’t have any formal education in data science, that’s
    fine, but you need to either demonstrate a track record of work in the field and/or
    advanced degrees in similar fields.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve seen some beautiful CVs (I’ve saved a few of these for personal inspiration),
    but I’ve also received text files (.txt) that lack any formatting. Working on
    your CV can be a pain, and if you’ve chosen data science as your endeavor, there’s
    a good chance you don’t enjoy creating aesthetic designs in your spare time. Without
    going overboard, you do want to look for a nice template that enables you to get
    everything across in limited space. Use the space wisely — it’s useful to split
    the page and highlight specific sections that don’t fall under the chronological
    work/education experience. This can include the tech stack you’re familiar with,
    a list of self-projects, links to your Github or blog, and others. A few simple
    icons can also help with emphasizing section headers.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you’re ‘4.5 stars’ at Leadership isn’t helpful. As a strong believer in a [growth
    mentality](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/), claiming
    to max out a skill (especially a harder to quantify and harder to master soft
    skill) feels very presumptuous.

- en: I’ve also seen this approach abused even further by taking the subjective measures
    and turning them into a pie chart (30% python, 10% team-player, etc.). While this
    was probably supposed to be a creative way to stand out, it demonstrates a lack
    of basic understanding behind the concepts of different charts.

    have only worked with Deep Learning, including on structured data that could have
    been better suited with tree-based models. While there’s no problem per se with
    being an expert at DL, limiting your toolset can limit your solution. As Maslow
    said: “If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as
    a nail.” At [Riskified](https://medium.com/riskified-technology), we deal with
    structured, domain-driven, feature-engineered data, which is best dealt with various
    forms of boosting trees. Having someone whose entire CV points back to DL is an
    issue.'

    — computer vision & NLP. Experts in these fields are in demand, and in many cases,
    their entire careers will be focused on these domains. While this is crucial if
    you’re looking for someone to work in that field, it’s typically a bad fit for
    someone to work in a more general data science role. So, if most of your experience
    is in NLP and you’re applying for a position outside the domain, try to emphasize
    positions/projects were you’ve worked on structured data to demonstrate variety.'

    learn, pandas, dplyr, etc.), clouds and their services (AWS, Azure, GCP), or other
    tools. Some candidates mix this up with algorithms or architectures they are familiar
    with (RNN, XGBoost, K-NN). On a personal note, I prefer that this revolve around
    technologies and tools; when a specific algorithm is mentioned, it makes me wonder
    whether the candidate’s theoretical ML knowledge is limited to just those specific
    algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here, I’m looking for the relevance of the tech stack — are they from the last
    few years (a positive sign that the candidate is hands-on and learning new skills),
    the breadth of the stack (are they very limited to specific tools, or are they
    familiar with quite a few things), and the fit with our stack (how much will we
    need to teach them).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is there something you’ve worked on that you can share on GitHub? Any Kaggle
    competition or side-project can be very helpful and enables looking at concise
    code, types of preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA, choice of algorithm, and
    countless other issues that need to be addressed in a real-life project. Add a
    link to your GitHub and Kaggle account for interviewers to dive into your code.
    If you don’t have much experience, there’s a good chance you’ll be asked about
    one or more of these projects. In some interviews I had, the candidate didn’t
    remember much about the project, and we couldn’t develop a conversation regarding
    the choices they made and the reason behind them. Be sure you brush up on the
    work you did or keep it out of the CV. Similarly, make sure you present your best
    work, and you’ve put enough time and effort into it. It’s better to have 2–3 high-quality
    projects than 8–10 medium (or lower) quality.
