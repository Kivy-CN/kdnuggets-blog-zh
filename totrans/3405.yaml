    isn't in the cards for whatever reason. Not all machine learning positions require
    a PhD; it really depends where on the machine learning spectrum one wants to fit
    in. Check out [this motivating and inspirational post](/2016/09/machine-learning-year-total-noob-effective-practitioner.html),

    graduate school machine learning regimen and what you can get from online tutorials?
    As they have been for hundreds of years, books are a great place to turn. :) Of
    course, today we have instant access to freely-available digital books, which
    makes this a very attractive alternative. Have a look at the following free ebooks,
    all of which are appropriate for an introductory level of understanding, but which
    also cover a variety of different concepts and material.

    you turn up your nopse at the thought of learning from something from the 90s,
    remember that foundation is foundation, regardless of when it was written about.

- en: Sure, many important advancements **have** been made in machine learning since
    this was put together, as Nilsson himself says, but these notes cover much of
    what is still considered relevant elementary material in a straightforward and
    focused manner. There are no diversions related to advancements of the past few
    decades, which authors often want to cover tangentially even in introductory texts.
    There is, however, a lot of information about statistical learning, learning theory,
    classification, and a variety of algorithms to whet your appetite. At < 200 pages,
    this can be read rather quickly.

    Ben-David. This book is newer, longer, and more advanced than the previous offering,
    but it is also a logical next step. This will delve deeper into more algorithms,
    their descriptions, and provide a bridge toward practicality as well. The focus
    on theory should be a clue to newcomers of its importance to really understand
    what is powering machine learning algorithms. The Advanced Theory section covers
    some concepts which may be beyond the scope or desire of a newcomer, but the option
    exists to have a look.

    good reason. Given its recent high-profile success as part of AlphaGo, its potential
    in self-driving cars and similar systems, and its marriage with deep learning,
    there is little reason to believe that reinforcement learning, which is undoubtedly
    to play a major role in any form of "General AI" (or anything resembling it),
    is going anywhere. Indeed, these are all reasons that a second draft of this book
