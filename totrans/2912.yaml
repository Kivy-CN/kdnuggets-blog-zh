    (16 min.) If you’re Google or Netflix, and you have a recommendation or search
    system as part of your bread and butter, what’s the best way to test improvements
    to your algorithm? A/B testing is the canonical answer for testing how users respond
    to software changes, but it gets tricky fast to think about what an A/B test means
    in the context of an algorithm that returns a ranked list. That’s why we’re talking
    about interleaving this week—it’s a simple modification to A/B testing that makes
    it much easier to race two algorithms against each other and find the winner,
    and it allows you to do it with much less data than a traditional A/B test.'

    discussions happened in the bar after the show. Read any business magazine, and
    you will find an article saying something along the lines of "Business Analytics
    is the hottest job category out there, and there is a significant lack of people,
    process and best practice." In this case, the conference was eMetrics, the bar
    was… multiple, and the attendees were Michael Helbling, Tim Wilson, and Jim Cain
    (Co-host Emeritus). After a few pints and a few hours of discussion about the
    cutting edge of digital analytics, they realized they might have something to
    contribute back to the community. This podcast is one of those contributions.
    Each episode is a closed topic and an open forum - the goal is for listeners to
    enjoy listening to Michael, Tim, and Moe share their thoughts and experiences
    and hopefully take away something to try at work the next day.

    This episode of the show was recorded in front of a live audience (No laugh tracks!
    No canned applause!) at the Marketing Analytics Summit (MAS) in Las Vegas. Moe,
    Michael, and Tim used a “What Grinds Our Gears?” application to discuss a range
    of challenges and frustrations that analysts face. They (well, Moe and Tim, of
    course) disagreed on a few of them, but they occasionally even proposed some ways
    to address the challenges, too.'

    (21 min.) When we polled our audience about what they were interested in, the
    most selected response was "business intelligence." As a follow-up, we asked them
    what business intelligence meant to them, and their responses boiled down to anything
    about understanding the data businesses are already collecting. That kind of broad
    definition gets to the heart of the confusion surrounding the differences between
    business intelligence and artificial intelligence. The line is starting to get
    blurry. Our guest this week is Elif Tutuk, Senior Director at Qlik. Tutuk talks
    about how business intelligence is evolving and how we might define it now that
    a lot of BI is becoming AI. Tutuk discusses where AI is making its way into business
    intelligence and what that might enable for businesses.'
