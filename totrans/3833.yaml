    lost when I had to write my own program to build projects from scratch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When deciding on a career path, I was firm on pursuing a field that didn’t require
    me to code. I felt like I just wasn’t cut out to become a programmer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I was stuck at home with a lot of free
    time on my hands. Since I didn’t have much else to do, I decided to give myself
    another chance at learning programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This time, though, I decided to do some research around why I was finding it
    so difficult to code. Was it true that some people were just naturally better
    at programming than others? Was I missing a secret ingredient that would make
    me a better programmer overnight?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I spent countless hours reading other people’s experiences with learning to
    code. I spoke to senior developers and data scientists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    me back from learning to code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You see, my issue wasn’t that I was not smart enough to become a programmer.
    It was that I didn’t possess the correct mindset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was treating programming like any other subject at school. I was trying to
    learn too much, too fast. And in doing that, I forgot that there was a learning
    curve. I got demotivated easily when my codes failed to run. I constantly compared
    myself with other, more experienced programmers whose codes I couldn’t understand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once I realized what I was doing wrong, I decided to do things differently this
    time. I coded everyday, and allowed myself to make mistakes along the way. At
    first, simple problems took me around 4–5 hours to solve. As I kept practicing,
    I was able to solve more complex problems at a faster pace. Slowly but surely,
    I saw myself get better at it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, I am by no means a proficient programmer. However, I am able to complete
    tasks at my day job, perform data science workflows, and take up freelance roles
    that require me to code. Every time I solve a new problem, my programming skills
    improve.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost all of us have taken a coding online course before. Tutorials are a great
    way to start learning to code, since they teach you basic programming concepts
    and syntax.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, **most people never stop taking tutorials**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve coded along to at least 10 programming YouTube videos, and purchased over
    5 online courses in multiple different languages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    online course.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, I didn’t.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every course I took taught me the same programming basics that I already knew.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, since I wasn’t applying any of these concepts in practice, I always
    failed to come up with my own piece of code to solve a problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was an awful situation to be in. Every time I took a new tutorial, I felt
    like I was learning something new. But when I tried to create a project on my
    own, I simply didn’t know where to start.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many programmers refer to this as the **tutorial trap**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if this situation sounds familiar to you, then it’s time to break out of
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve taken an introductory course to learn basic programming concepts,
    start to put your knowledge into practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I suggest using a coding challenge site to hone your skills. I signed up to
    a platform called [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). They present coding
    problems in a variety of different languages, with varying levels of difficulty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Start out with the most basic challenges, then work your way up to the more
    difficult ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At first, I used to spend around 3–4 hours solving even the most basic problems.
    I’d look at other coder’s solutions to the question, then reframe their thought
    process into my own piece of code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This way, I slowly moved away from just copy-pasting codes. I was able to understand
    different people’s thought processes, and restructure it to match my own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Doing this will enhance your programming skills, as you will come to realize
    that there are many different ways to look at the same problem.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning to code is like riding a bike. You need to be willing to fall multiple
    times before you finally get the hang of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I first started learning to code, I lacked **patience**. After spending
    a couple of hours learning a new programming concept, I expected to be able to
    put it into practice successfully. Every time I ran into an error, I got frustrated.
    I started losing confidence. Slowly, I gave up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We live in a world in which most results are instantaneous. We expect quick
    outcomes, and in the process, tend to forget that there is a learning curve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another mistake I made was that I always compared myself to other people. When
    I read other programmer’s codes that were complicated and difficult to understand,
    I often felt like I was never going to get there. It seemed as though I’d never
    be as good as they were, and this again lowered my confidence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It took me a while to realize that there was no way to become a proficient coder
    without **practice**. Every good programmer I know has had years of experience
    in the field. They’d spend hours in front of a computer screen every day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in speaking to them, I realized that they all faced the same issues I did.
    Even with years of experience in the field, they still run into errors that can
    take up to days, or even weeks to solve. They also struggle when having to make
    the shift to a different framework, and face difficulties when reading other people’s
    codes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coding isn’t easy. Even seasoned programmers face problems that are seemingly
    impossible to solve. They too get frustrated when coding. As the amount of experience
    they have increases, so does the complexity of the tasks they need to complete.

    your mindset, start working on something you’re passionate about.
  prefs: []

- en: Building a full-fledged project is a great way to put all the skills you’ve
    learnt into practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of my current knowledge comes from the projects I’ve created — both at
    work and on my own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, when you create a project, you go beyond the tool stack you’ve learnt
    in online courses and tutorials. You need to expand to different frameworks and
    possibly even multiple languages to come up with an end-product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will improve your programming skills dramatically. And when you land a
    job in the industry, even if you’re required to use a different set of tools to
    solve the problem at hand, you’d be able to pick it up a lot faster.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning to code involves practice, patience, and the ability to let yourself
    fail multiple times before you get even half decent at it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More than anything else, it requires a massive shift in mindset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people expect themselves to become expert coders after completing online
    courses. When they feel stuck, they give up on the problem too quickly, and feel
    like they just aren’t smart or prepared enough to learn programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This feeling of “*it’s just too difficult*” has driven many aspiring data scientists
    to quit and switch to a different career path.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To overcome this, you need to understand that there is no way to become a decent
    programmer without spending a lot of time coding. You need tons of practice, and
    need to learn to fail multiple times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spend time on coding challenge platforms. If you feel stuck, look at existing
    solutions posted by other programmers. Try to replicate their thought process.
    Keep doing this until you build confidence in your ability to code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, create your own practice projects from scratch. Make sure to give yourself
    enough time to learn, fail, and grow. If you have friends who are on the same
    journey, work with them on a project. This way, you can share ideas and motivate
    each other to consistently learn.
