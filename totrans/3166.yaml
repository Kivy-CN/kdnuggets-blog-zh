    an exponential increase in online availability of information. From web pages
    to emails, science journals, e-books, learning content, news and social media
    are all full of textual data. The idea is to create, analyze and report information
    fast. This is when automated text classification steps up.

    using machine learning to automate these tasks, just makes the whole process super-fast
    and efficient. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are arguably the most
    beneficial technologies to have gained momentum in recent times. They are finding
    applications everywhere. As Jeff Bezos said in his annual shareholder’s letter,

    could describe with clear rules and algorithms. Modern machine learning techniques
    now allow us to do the same for tasks where describing the precise rules is much
    harder.

    about the [technology behind it](https://blog.paralleldots.com/text-analytics/get-organized-with-automated-text-classification/)
    and its [applications](https://blog.paralleldots.com/text-analytics/text-classification-applications-use-cases/).
    We are now updating our text classifier. In this post, we talk about the technology,
    applications, customization, and segmentation related to our automated text classification
    [API](https://www.paralleldots.com/text-analysis-apis#text-classification).

    important parts of text classification. These use cases have made significant
    buzz among the machine intelligence enthusiasts. We have developed separate classifiers
    for each such category as their study is a huge topic in itself. Text classifier
    can operate on a variety of textual datasets. You can train the classifier with
    tagged data or operate on the raw unstructured text as well. Both of these categories
    have numerous application of themselves.

    categories. It works on training and testing principle. We feed labeled data to
    the machine learning algorithm to work on. The algorithm is trained on the labeled
    dataset and gives the desired output(the pre-defined categories). During the testing
    phase, the algorithm is fed with unobserved data and classifies them into categories
    based on the training phase.

    email is automatically categorized based on its content. Language detection, intent,
    emotion and sentiment analysis are all based on supervised systems. It can operate
    for special use cases such as identifying emergency situation by analyzing millions
    of online information. It is a needle in the haystack problem. We proposed a smart
    public transportation [system](https://blog.paralleldots.com/technology/artificial-intelligence-can-make-public-transportation-safer/)
    to identify such situations. To identify emergency situation among millions of
    online conversation, the classifier has to be trained with high accuracy. It needs
    special loss functions, sampling at training time and methods like building a
    stack of multiple classifiers each refining the results of previous one to solve
    this problem.

    algorithms are given a set of tagged/categorized text (also called train set)
    based on which they generate AI models, these models when further given the new
    untagged text, can automatically classify them. Several of our [APIs](https://www.paralleldots.com/text-analysis-apis),
    are developed with supervised systems. The [text classifier](https://www.paralleldots.com/text-analysis-apis#text-classification)
    is currently trained for a set of generic 150 categories.

    Here the algorithms try to discover natural structure in data. Please note that
    natural structure might not be exactly what humans think of as logical division.
    The algorithm looks for similar patterns and structures in the data points and
    groups them into clusters. The classification of the data is done based on the
    clusters formed. Take web search for an example. The algorithm makes clusters
    based on the search term and presents them as results to the user.

    cluster if one category of similar tweets. Unsupervised classification comes handy
    while generating insights from textual data. It is highly customizable as no tagging
    is required. It can operate on any textual data without the need of training and
    tagging it. Thus, the unsupervised classification is language agnostic.

- en: A lot of the times, the biggest hindrance to use Machine learning is the unavailability
    of a data-set. There are many people who want to use AI for categorizing data
    but that needs making a data-set giving rise to a situation similar to a chicken-egg
    problem. Custom text classification is one of the best way to build your own text
    classifier without any data set.

- en: In ParallelDots’ latest [research work](https://paralleldots.xyz/Zero-Shot-Learning-for-Text-Classification),
    we have proposed a method to do zero-shot learning on text, where an algorithm
    trained to learn relationships between sentences and their categories on a large
    noisy dataset can be made to generalize to new categories or even new datasets.
    We call the paradigm “Train Once , Test Anywhere”. We also propose multiple neural
    network algorithms that can take advantage of this training methodology and get
    good results on different datasets. The best method uses an LSTM model for the
    task of learning relationships. The idea is if one can model the concept of “belongingness”
    between sentences and classes, the knowledge is useful for unseen classes or even
    unseen datasets.

    and tweak your category list as much as you want before publishing them. Once
    the categories are published, you will get an application id which will let you

    can be a great tool to build a text classifier without much investment. We also
    believe that it will bring down the threshold of building practical machine learning
    models that can applied across industries solving a variety of use-cases.
