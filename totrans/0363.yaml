    the data immediately, but the truth is there are too many models. First, you need
    to get to grips with the kind of data you’ve got. Then you can look for significant
    insights and predictions.

    analyzing user activity and engagement on the platform. You could look at metrics
    like the number of commits, pull requests, and issues, as well as user interactions
    and collaborations. By exploring this data, you gain an understanding of how users
    engage with the platform, identify popular repositories, and uncover trends in
    software development practices.

    of tables, data visualization is also included in data exploration. For example,
    as a GitHub data scientist, you might use line charts to show the number of commits
    over time. Bar charts could be used to compare the popularity of different programming
    languages used on the platform. Network graphs could illustrate collaborations
    between users or repositories.

    Now, if you’re having a hard time getting a job as a data scientist, remember
    you don’t have to start from scratch. I recommend you start more junior and angle
    into the role over time. You could always start as a data analyst, data engineer,
    or machine learning engineer.
