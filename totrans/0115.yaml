- en: We’ve had so much news in 2023, with AI systems being released left right and
    center. There is so much hype around GPT-3.5 and LLaMa, with high expectations
    that nothing will be able to surpass their performance. In order to produce better
    performance within Generative AI, it consists of a lot of pre-training and fine-tuning.

    create a personal AI for everyone for their unique needs. In May 2023, they released
    their personal AI assistant - [Pi.ai](https://pi.ai/)- designed to be empathetic
    and safe. One of the major challenges with Large Language Models (LLMs) is the
    concerns around safety, data privacy and the accuracy of the outputs. Inflection.AI
    has a goal of achieving high-quality, safe, and useful AI LLMs.'

- en: When you’re using LLMs such as ChatGPT, the responses don’t feel very personal
    to you specifically. Imagine having an AI assistant or companion that understands
    the way you think, is empathetic, and is useful to your daily needs.

    brings you and technology closer. Pi is powered by the AI model Inflection-1\.
    Inflection-1 was built to create a personal assistant that can talk to you, just
    like a human.

    remarks that is it better than GPT-3.5, Chinchilla, and LLaMA. It was trained
    using thousands of NVIDIA H100 GPUs on large datasets.

    against other LLMs. This technical memo, states that Inflection-1 was the #1 model
    in its compute class, showing that it outperformed GPT-3.5, LLaMA, Chinchilla,
    and PaLM-540B. The company will also be releasing a technical memo, showing a
    comparison of one of their models against PaLM-2 and GPT-4.'
