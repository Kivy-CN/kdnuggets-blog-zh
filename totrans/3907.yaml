- en: Artificial intelligence(AI) has been an atypical technology trend. In a traditional
    technology cycle, innovation typically begins with startups trying to disrupt
    industry incumbents. In the case of AI, most of the innovation in the space has
    been coming from the big corporate labs of companies like Google, Facebook, Uber
    or Microsoft. Those companies are not only leading impressive tracks of research
    but also regularly open sourcing new frameworks and tools that streamline the
    adoption of AI technologies. In that context, Uber has emerged as one of the most
    active contributors to open source AI technologies in the current ecosystems.
    In just a few years, Uber has regularly open sourced projects across different
    areas of the AI lifecycle. Today, I would like to review a few of my favorites.

    all the traditional AI requirements of a large scale tech company with a front
    row seat to AI-first transportation scenarios. As a result, Uber has been building
    machine/deep learning applications across largely diverse scenarios ranging from
    customer classifications to self-driving vehicles. Many of the technologies used
    by Uber teams have been open sourced and received accolades from the machine learning
    community. Let’s look at some of my favorites:'

- en: Using Ludwig, a data scientist can train a deep learning model by simply providing
    a CSV file that contains the training data as well as a YAML file with the inputs
    and outputs of the model. Using those two data points, Ludwig performs a multi-task
    learning routine to predict all outputs simultaneously and evaluate the results.
    Under the covers, Ludwig provides a series of deep learning models that are constantly
    evaluated and can be combined in a final architecture. The Uber engineering team
    explains this process by using the following analogy: *“if deep learning libraries
    provide the building blocks to make your building, Ludwig provides the buildings
    to make your city, and you can choose among the available buildings or add your
    own building to the set of available ones.”*

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These principles often pull Pyro’s implementation in opposite directions. Being
    universal, for instance, requires allowing arbitrary control structure within
    Pyro programs, but this generality makes it difficult to scale. However, in general,
    Pyro achieves a brilliant balance between these capabilities making one of the
    best PPLs for real world applications.

    of the platform. In PRDS, each component can be trained either online (from interactions)
    or offline and incorporate into the core engine. From the training standpoint,
    PRDS supports interactions with human and simulated users. The latter are common
    to jumpstart conversational AI agents in research scenarios while the former is
    more representative of live interactions.
