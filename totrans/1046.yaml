    at their internal data differently. Organizations that have access to valuable
    datasets are starting to explore opportunities that will let them share and monetize
    their data outside the four walls of their business.

    is becoming a big deal and companies need to figure out a mechanism to get their
    data in front of people who will buy it. More generally, companies are hungry
    for data from non-traditional sources that they can use to enhance models, uncover
    hidden trends, and (yes) find “alpha”. This need has generated a lot of interest
    in data discovery platforms and marketplaces. Venturebeat featured data sharing

    by which you choose who you will let use your data, and for what purposes, is
    a strategic question that organizations should think through. But outside of the

    part of core processes or a small piece of an experiment – how you connect to
    it is often as important as why. For modern companies looking to get more out
    of their data, choosing to deploy a data catalog shouldn’t mean you have to move
    your data. The benefits of a platform that lets you organize, discover, share,
    and monetize your data can’t come at the cost of migrating your database to the

    copies of the dataset. Aside from the overhead of building a client-friendly version
    of your datasets, this is bad practice from a data governance perspective.

    data-driven require systems and infrastructure that disrupts their standard operating
    procedure as little as possible. One of the problems with many sharing solutions
    and traditional data catalogs is there is a primary migration step to the public
    cloud that isn’t possible. For organizations with mission-critical or sensitive
    data and transactional workloads, the fine-grained control of an on-premises data
    center will always be a necessity.

    experience, not a consumption model. The data marketplace has, historically, been
    a place that gives users the ability to find data but not a mechanism by which

    a dataset in a new cloud region, but it’s a bit unwieldy (recreating the data

    create runaway costs for compute and storage if you’re not careful.
