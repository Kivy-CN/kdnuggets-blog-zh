- en: Code performance versus simplicity. Delivery speed versus duplication. Flexibility
    versus maintainability—every decision you make in software engineering involves
    balancing tradeoffs.

- en: But the longer a software system lives, the harder it is to change your early
    decisions. Each choice you make in development leaves a legacy that limits your
    future directions and sets you firmly down a particular path. Often, you’ll be
    making those decisions under pressure from deadlines, cost considerations, and
    other challenges, and that’s when the sensible tradeoffs turn into mistakes.

- en: '[Software Mistakes and Tradeoffs](http://mng.bz/y49G) helps you optimize those
    vital decisions that will come to define your code. The fun, friendly guide comes
    directly from veteran developer Tomasz Lelek and industry hero Jon Skeet, one
    of the [world’s greatest living programmers](http://www.itworld.com/article/2823547/enterprise-software/158256-superclass-14-of-the-world-s-best-living-programmers.html).
    Inside, the authors reveal real-world scenarios from their long careers, and explore
    where the wrong tradeoff decisions were made and what could have been done differently.
    You’ll soon start noticing the design decisions you make every day, and how you
    can start making them more mindfully.'

    how to strike a balance between API flexibility and the need to reduce the amounts
    of maintenance, and even how to decide when to update your code to new trends
    and paradigms. Discover how to efficiently narrow your optimization scope according
    to 80/20 Pareto principles and ensure consistency in your distributed systems.
    You’ll soon be able to apply the author’s hard-won experience to your own projects
    to pre-empt mistakes and take a more thoughtful approach to decision making.
