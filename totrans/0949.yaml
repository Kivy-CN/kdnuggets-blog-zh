- en: Data has become the heart of all businesses across the world. Organizations
    heavily rely on data assets for the decision-making process but unfortunately
    “100% clean and accurate data” doesn’t exist. Data is impacted by numerous factors
    that deteriorate its quality. According to experts, the best way to fight data
    issues is to identify their root causes and introduce new processes to improve
    their quality. This article covers the common data quality issues faced by businesses
    and how can they fix them optimally. Before we dig deeper into this, Let us first
    understand why the knowledge of these issues is important and what impact it makes
    on business activities.

- en: '**What is data quality?** Data quality refers to the measurement of the current
    state of data against traits like completeness, accuracy, reliability, relevance,
    and timeliness. While the data quality issue indicates the presence of a defect
    that harms the above-mentioned traits. Data is beneficial only if its of high
    quality. Some of the consequences of poor-quality data are as follows:'

    Hence, there is a high possibility of **typographical mistakes** leading to inaccurate
    data. This data entry can be done both by the customers and the employees. Customers
    may write the correct data into the wrong data field. Similarly, employees may
    make a mistake while handling or migrating the data. Experts recommend automating
    the process to minimize the involvement of data capture from humans. Some steps
    that may help in this regard are:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nowadays, data comes from multiple channels giving rise to duplicate data when
    merged. It results in multiple variations of the same record providing skewed
    analytical results and incorrect insights.  The budget is also wasted on these
    duplicate records. You can make use of **Data Duplication Tools** to find similar
    types of records and flag them as duplicates. Another technique that may help
    you out is standardizing your data fields and having some strict validation checks
    on data entry.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mismatches in the same information across multiple data sources can lead to
    data inconsistencies. Consistency is important to correctly leverage the data.
    The inconsistencies may arise from different units and languages. For example,
    the distance may be expressed in km while m was required. It messes up all the
    operations of the business and needs to be addressed at the source so that the
    data pipelines provide trusted data. Therefore, need to make all the desired conversions
    before the migration and introduce the **validity constraints**. Constant monitoring
    of the data quality can also help you identify these inconsistencies.

- en: Inaccurate data can seriously impact the decision-making holding the businesses
    to achieve their goals. It is tough to identify because the format, unit, and
    language are correct but there may be a spelling mistake or missing data making
    it inaccurate. Loss of data integrity and data drift (unexpected changes over
    time) are also indicative of data inaccuracy. We need to track them down in the
    early stages of the data lifecycle by employing various data management and data
    quality tools. These tools should be intelligent enough to spot these issues by
    automatically **excluding incomplete entries** and generating an alert.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, many fields in the dataset may be calculated from the other fields
    to extract meaningful information. These are called **computed fields**. For instance,
    age is derived from the date of birth. Whenever a new record is added, these formulas
    are computed automatically and the use of the wrong formula will make that complete
    field inaccurate. Violating these rules and logic results in invalid data. **Testing**
    your system at various stages can help you fix this issue.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overwhelming the system with loads of data buries the key insights and adds
    in the irrelevant data. The additional overhead of capturing, organizing, and
    sorting all this data is not only an expensive process but is ineffective too.
    This load of data makes it difficult to analyze the trends and patterns, identify
    the outliers and introduce changes due to the ample amount of time that it takes.
    Data coming from different sources need to be cleaned by **filtering out the irrelevant
    data** and organizing it properly. This technique ensures that your data is relevant
    yet complete.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Durations when the data is in a partial, erroneous, or inaccurate state, refer
    to the data downtime. It is extremely costly for data-driven organizations that
    heavily rely on behavioral data for running their operations. Some common factors
    that may cause data downtime are unexpected changes in the schema, migration issues,
    network or server failure, Incompatible data, etc. But, what’s important is to
    measure the downtime continuously and minimize it through automated solutions.
    Downtime can be eliminated by introducing **Data observability** from source to
    consumption. Data observability is the organization’s ability to understand data
    health and improve it by employing best practices. Moreover, companies should
    introduce SLAs to hold the data teams accountable for their actions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies that experience rapid growth also accumulate data rapidly. They only
    use a portion of their collected data, dumping the remaining one to different
    data warehouses. It is referred to as hidden data because although it tends to
    optimize processes and provide valuable insights, it is not used. Most companies
    do not have a coherent and centralized approach to data collection which gives
    rise to hidden data. **Centralizing your data** is the best way to overcome this
    problem.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data can become obsolete very fast and inevitably leads to data decay. The object
    described by the data changes, but these changes go unnoticed by the computers.
    For example, if a person has changed his field but the database still shows outdated
    data. This problem of getting the data out of sync as compared to reality deteriorates
    the data quality. **Set reminders to review and update your data** to ensure that
    it is not old and stale.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite making all the effort, if the organizational teams are not data literate
    they will make incorrect data quality assumptions. Understanding data attributes
    is not simple because the same field may mean differently in various records.
    This ability to visualize the impact of updates and what each attribute indicates
    comes with experience. A **session on data literacy** should be organized for
    explaining the data to all the teams working on it.
