    premises known as true, we derive some sort of logically unreasonable result.
    As Machine Learning models create knowledge from data, this makes them susceptible
    to possible cognitive paradoxes between training and testing.

    study in order to find out if doing daily physical exercises can help or not reduce
    Cholesterol levels (in mg/dL) and we are now starting to examine the obtained
    results. First, we divide our population sample into two main categories based
    on the individual''s age (under/over 60 years old) and then we plot their cholesterol
    levels against the number of hours the subjects exercised per day. By examining
    the results in the first two plots of Figure 1, we can then infer that exercising
    for more hours a day can then lead to an overall reduction in our cholesterol
    levels. This hypothesis can then also be reinforced by examining the overall trend
    of the best fit line inferred through Linear Regression and the quite strong negative
    Person Correlation scored in both cases.'

- en: At this point, reassured by our derived results, we can then try to repeat this
    same analysis taking into consideration this time the whole population sample
    (rightmost plot in Figure 1). In this case, we are faced with a completely contradictory
    scenario and a positive correlation implying that more exercise can lead to increased
    cholesterol levels.

- en: This type of scenario is commonly known as Simpson’s Paradox and takes place
    every time we have some form of correlation which points in a direction when considered
    in a sub-group and points instead in the opposite direction if considered as part
    of the whole group. In order to unveil the reasons behind this type of mechanism,
    we need to try to go beyond the provided data and think about how our data was
    generated in the first place to cause this outcome (e.g. what unknown missing
    variable might be preventing us to see the full picture?).
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In this simple scenario, our missing component could be any potentially influential
    variable such as: individual’s comorbidities, diet and age. We decide then to
    take a closer look at how cholesterol levels vary with greater age (Figure 2).
    Repeating the same analysis done in Figure 1, we can then clearly see how cholesterol
    levels are strongly positively correlated to the individual’s age.'

    to increase with ageing and lack of exercise (there is a cause-effect relationship
    between the three variables). Therefore, in order to try to quantify the benefits
    of exercising in reducing cholesterol levels and overcome the Simpson Paradox,
    we should then make sure to run our experiment while having a fixed value for
    the age of the subjects (controlling the variable).

- en: In our daily life, it is quite common to think that going deeper into studying
    a subject or learning about a topic will necessarily lead to a greater understanding
    of the studied phenomena. Although, this isn’t always true, as overspecialization
    can at times lead us to underestimate the importance of **the bigger picture**.
  id: totrans-26

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This same pattern can happen when creating Machine Learning models that are
    more complex than necessary. In this case, our model would end up focusing too
    much on the single data points and not paying attention to the overall trend in
    the data (**overfitting**). In this scenario, our model would then be able to
    perform well on the training data (of which it memorised every little detail),
    while failing to generalise to new unseen data.

    a good estimate of house prices in Italy. Although, our complex model will most
    likely perform worse than the linear model (underfitting) when trying, for instance,
    to predict house prices in another country for which it hasn’t been trained on
    (e.g. Spain).

    training (a model complexity penalty). In this way, we reduce the weights associated
    with the less important features and focus our attention on the features which
    provide us with more information.

    working with imbalanced training datasets (some classes appear with much greater
    frequency than others). In this instance, calculating the precision and recall
    of the model can become a much more valuable metric.

- en: According to these theorems, nowadays Mathematics has some intrinsic limitations
    which doesn’t allow it to state with certainty if a statement is true or not.
    The whole field of Data Science is deeply interconnected with mathematical thinking
    and therefore this leads us to a paradox (Learnability-Godel Paradox).

  zh: 根据这些定理，如今数学具有一些固有的限制，这些限制使得它无法确定一个陈述是否真实。数据科学领域与数学思维紧密相连，因此这引出了一个悖论（可学习性-哥德尔悖论）。
- en: Depending on if Gödel theory is right or wrong, this would demonstrate to be
    either possible or not to make extrapolations from a population sample. Machine
    Learning models heavily relies on using sample datasets for training and if this
    would be proven to not be enough, then would make it impossible for them to perform
    correctly any form of extrapolation/prediction. In fact, training a Machine Learning
    model on the entire population data could be computationally not feasible and
    in most cases, it would almost be impossible to collect data about an entire population
    in the first place.

  zh: 根据哥德尔理论的正误，这将证明从人口样本中进行外推是可能还是不可能的。机器学习模型严重依赖于使用样本数据集进行训练，如果这被证明是不够的，那么将使得它们正确执行任何形式的外推/预测变得不可能。事实上，训练一个机器学习模型所需的全人口数据在计算上可能不可行，而且在大多数情况下，首先收集整个种群的数据几乎是不可能的。
