    of their everyday lives.

    about how the coronavirus situation changes day by day. Several organizations,
    including Johns Hopkins University, IBM and Tableau, [have released interactive
    databases](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-track-the-coronavirus-dashboard-delivers-real-time-view-of-the-deadly-virus/) that
    offer real-time views of what's happening with the virus.

    U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization
    (WHO). They also include direct links to those places so that people have quick,
    easy access to reliable information.

    and recoveries. Then, whether a person is on the front lines of the coronavirus
    fight or a concerned citizen trying to stay informed, they can get all or most
    of the information they need in one place.

- en: Contact tracing is an effective way to slow COVID-19\. It involves getting in
    touch with a person's close contacts after that individual tests positive for
    the virus and telling them to self-isolate. Contact tracing is time-consuming,
    although it's getting easier as more people take social distancing seriously.

    to make contact tracing even more efficient. The experts working on the project
    asserted that mathematical models showed them how traditional methods of contact
    tracing used in public health are not fast enough to thoroughly slow the spread
    of COVID-19.

    to call the contacts manually. Instead, those parties get text messages confirming
    the need for self-isolation. The researchers clarify that their approach would
    be most effective if it gets support from national leaders and is not an effort
    primarily spearheaded by independent app developers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    phones and the familiarity people have with receiving texts, however, it's easy
    to see why this approach makes sense.

    classic symptoms include a fever and a cough — two issues not restricted to the
    coronavirus. These things could make it easier for people to unknowingly spread
    the disease. But, developers created an app that [uses data-sharing to help](https://www.techradar.com/news/this-covid-19-tracking-app-lets-you-help-scientists-study-the-coronavirus)
    medical experts learn more about the virus.

    200,000 users. People can and should interact with the app even if they are asymptomatic
    or do not think their symptoms are COVID-19-related. The more researchers know
    about the coronavirus, the better equipped they are to tackle it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People interact with the app to do a short daily symptom check-in. They also
    give their age and postal code, plus disclose any preexisting conditions. That
    information helps scientists determine the groups that are most affected or at
    risk. The app does not take user data for commercial purposes, but it gives it
    to people who are working to stop the coronavirus, including some at health organizations.

    quickly as possible to uncover effective treatments. Two graduates of the data
    science program at Columbia University have turned to machine learning to help.
    The typical process of antibody discovery in a lab takes years. This approach,
    however, [takes only a week](https://datascience.columbia.edu/dsi-alumni-use-machine-learning-discover-coronavirus-treatments)
    to screen for therapeutic antibodies with a high likelihood of success.
  prefs: []

- en: The team taking this approach says this method is less costly than traditional
    ones, too. Humans are still part of the process because they have to test the
    gene sequences identified as most promising by the machine learning algorithm.
    However, using this expedited method could be crucial in efficiently finding interventions
    that work for coronavirus patients.

    in showing them how COVID-19 spreads. A graph database shows links between people,
    places or things. Scientists refer to each of those entities as a node, and the
    connections between them are the "edges." The results give a visual representation
    of the relationship between things, if any.

    a graph database tool called Epidemic Spread. It allowed people to type in identifying
    information [associated with the journeys they took](https://www.datanami.com/2020/03/12/tracking-the-spread-of-coronavirus-with-graph-databases/),
    such as a flight number or even a car's license plate. The database would then
    tell those users whether anyone with a confirmed coronavirus case took those same
    trips and may have spread it to fellow passengers.
