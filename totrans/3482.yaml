    of projects that we do at Machinalis and how strange does it feels to say that
    “we are a Machine Learning company”: In many projects, the amount of effort spent
    on R&D on Machine Learning is usually a small fraction of the total effort, or
    it’s not even there because we plan it for a future phase after building the application
    first. At this moment, Norvig quoted a friend of him who said:'

    Learning or Data Science into their processes. In these situations they call us
    just to get some raisins.

    project, but a *research* and development one. Even for some better-known problems
    that do not strictly follow this rule; the typical level of uncertainty is higher
    than in traditional development projects, and much higher if the expectations
    about the deliverable involve identify, design and/or achieve specific values
    for metrics like precision or accuracy.

    Learning concepts that allows you to communicate a detailed vision of the problem

    will respond in kind by learning about the business side. You don’t want that,
    after having worked as separate silos, at the end the project you get a result
    that’s attractive from the scientific standpoint, but insignificant to your business
