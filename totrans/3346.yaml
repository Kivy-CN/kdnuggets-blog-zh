- en: In 2016, we saw a wide range of breakthroughs having to do with artificial intelligence
    and [deep learning in particular](https://www.wired.com/2016/12/2016-year-deep-learning-took-internet/).
    Google, Facebook, and Baidu announced several breakthroughs using deep learning.
    Google also defeated Go.

    class of machine learning algorithms. It has a long history, taking its roots
    in the earlier days of computer science. However, not all of machine learning
    is deep learning.'

    seems to have a lot of successes.

    that it used “counterfactual regret minimization”, a conventional machine learning
    that is not a form of deep learning.

    there really still artificial intelligence researchers working on techniques other
    than deep learning? (I’m being half serious.)

    culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-3rtpkywWw). The organizers retroactively
    renamed the panel “Are we promoting Canadian content through deep-learning algorithms?”
    Yet the panel did not address deep learning per se. The successes of deep learning
    have been so remarkable that “deep learning” has become synonymous with “algorithm”.

    smart young computer scientist is planning to work on deep learning. Maybe I exaggerate
    a little, but barely. I have seen proposals to apply deep learning to everything,
    from recognizing cancer cells all the way to tutoring kids.

    intelligence, and you are not focused on deep learning, you have to explain yourself.

- en: Of course, machine learning is a vast field with many classes of techniques.
    However, one almost gets the impression that all of the major problems are going
    to be solved using deep learning. In fact, some proponents of deep learning have
    almost made this explicit claim… they often grant that other techniques may work
    well… on the small problems… but they often stress that for the large problems,
    deep learning is bound to win out.

- en: We will keep on seeing very hard problems being defeated using various techniques,
    often unrelated to deep learning. If I am right, this means that these young computer
    scientists and start-up founders who flock to deep learning should be cautious.
    They may end up in an overcrowded field, missing out on important breakthroughs
    happening elsewhere.

    bullet and we will soon “solve intelligence” using deep learning… all problems
    will fall using variations on deep learning… Or it could be that researchers will
    soon hit diminishing returns. They will need to work harder and harder for ever
    smaller gains.

- en: There are significant limitations to deep learning. For example, when I reviewed
    scholarship applications… many of the young computer scientists aiming to solve
    hard problems with deep learning did not have correspondingly massive data sources.
    Having an almost infinite supply of data is a luxury few can afford.

    There must exist some technique that makes software intelligent in a general way.
    That is, we can “solve intelligence”… we can build software in a generic way to
    solve all other problems.

    book](http://a-fwd.com/asin-com=0525428089&com=daniellemires-20&ca=danilemisblog-20&uk=danilemisblog-21&de=danilemisbl05-21&fr=danilemisbl0e-21&it=danilemisbl02-21&jp=danilemisblog-22&cn=danilemisblog-23&fb=com&sc=w),
    suggests that there is no such thing. All intelligence is specialized. Our intelligence
    “feels” general to us, but that’s an illusion. We think we are good at solving
    most problems but we are not.

    Given a lot of training and dedication, some of us can write formal proofs without
    error. However, we are highly inefficient at it. I predict that it is a matter
    of decade or two before the unassisted human brain is recognized as being obsolete
    for research in advanced mathematics. The old guy doing mathematics on a blackboard?
    That’s going to look quaint.

    believe that any one machine-learning technique can be a silver bullet.

    Ridley points out in his latest book](http://a-fwd.com/asin-com=0062296000&com=daniellemires-20&ca=danilemisblog-20&uk=danilemisblog-21&de=danilemisbl05-21&fr=danilemisbl0e-21&it=danilemisbl02-21&jp=danilemisblog-22&cn=danilemisblog-23&fb=com&sc=w)
    that everything evolves by a process akin to natural selection. Nature acquires
    an ever growing bag of tricks that are being constantly refined. In effect, there
    is an overarching process of trial and error. This is truly general, but with
    a major trade-off: it is expensive. Our biology evolved but it took all of the
    Earth ecosystem millions of years to produce homo sapiens. Our technology evolves,
    but it takes all of the power of human civilization to keep it going. It is also
    not fool-proof. There are regular extinction events.'
