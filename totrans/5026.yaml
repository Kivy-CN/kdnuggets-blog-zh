- en: For many quantitative business professionals, the debate around analytics tools
    has been known to rival the enthusiasm of political conversations at Thanksgiving
    dinner. Over the past two years we’ve [sent out](http://www.burtchworks.com/2015/05/21/2015-sas-vs-r-survey-results/) an [immensely
    popular](http://www.burtchworks.com/2014/04/04/the-great-debate-sas-vs-r/) SAS
    vs. R survey to our network of quantitative professionals, generating over 1,000
    (often very passionate) responses each year. But, last year, we received enough
    write-in requests to include Python in our survey that we decided to evolve with
    the times!

- en: Our results show that support for open source tools has been steadily climbing
    over the past three years, with 61.3% of respondents this year choosing R or Python,
    and 38.6% choosing SAS. As per usual, there were a few professionals who responded
    with neither/both, or with write-ins for other tools. Who knows, perhaps our survey
    will have to evolve again next year? We’ll see!

    results we couldn’t wait to dig into our survey data from the past three years
    and see what we could discover.

- en: In this year’s results, it’s easy to see that the largest proportion of Python
    supporters are on the coasts, with the West Coast edging more towards open source
    options R and Python than any other region. R support is highest in the Mountain
    region, and SAS support continues to be highest in the Midwest and Southeast.

- en: Similar to last year, Tech/Telecom most heavily favors open source options R
    and Python, which is not too surprising given the prevalence of West Coast supporters.
    As in 2014 and 2015, SAS continues to have a stronghold in the Retail/CPG and
    Financial Services industries.

    holders are more likely to prefer SAS than R. Support for Python varies slightly,
    but is strongest amongst professionals with a Ph.D.

- en: Support for open source tools R and Python is the greatest amongst professionals
    with 0-5 years’ experience, while support for SAS is greatest amongst professionals
    with 16+ years’ experience. As more universities have moved towards teaching open
    source tools like R and Python in their programs, we’ve seen more support for
    these options from junior professionals.

- en: Python holds the majority of support amongst data scientists, with SAS only
    holding 3% amongst this group. This is likely due to its limitations when building
    the custom tools that many data scientists use to manage unstructured data. Amongst
    other predictive analytics professionals, SAS and R support is relatively even. For
    more information about how we define “data scientist”, check out [this blog](http://www.burtchworks.com/2015/05/11/how-to-identify-a-data-scientist/).

    from last year, you can check out [this blog post](http://www.burtchworks.com/2015/06/01/sas-vs-r-2015-the-deeper-dive/).
    We also presented more detail on these results in a 15-minute webinar, and you
    can find [the recording](https://youtu.be/DS8P8url03o) on our YouTube channel.
    We always find the [evolution of tools and methodologies in predictive analytics](http://www.burtchworks.com/2015/10/05/the-evolution-of-predictive-analytics/) to
    be pretty interesting, so we look forward to this every year. What did you think
    of the results, did anything surprise you? Let us know in the comments!
