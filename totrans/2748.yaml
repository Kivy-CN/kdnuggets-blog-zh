- en: Machine learning educational content is often in the form of academic papers
    or blog articles. These resources are incredibly valuable. However, they can sometimes
    be lengthy and time-consuming. If you just want to learn basic concepts and don’t
    require all the math and theory behind them, concise machine learning videos may
    be a better option. The Youtube videos on this list cover concepts such as [what
    machine learning is](https://lionbridge.ai/artSACicles/whats-the-difference-between-ai-machine-learning-and-deep-learning/),
    the basics of natural language processing, how computer vision works, and machine
    learning in video games.

    competition can lead to intelligent behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this video, OpenAI explains how they built a virtual world of hide and seek
    with simple rules and rudimentary tools. Within this world, they placed multiple
    agents with the role of either hider or seeker. After millions of rounds, the
    agents started to learn how to use tools to their advantage, through reinforcement
    learning. They began collaborating and finding creative ways to win the game.
    Eventually, they even learned how to use bugs in the programming to cheat their
    way to a victory. An alternate video with more commentary about the experiment
    can be found on the [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M&t=303s) channel.
