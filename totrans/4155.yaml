- en: While data scientists can and do utilize SQL, it can quite frankly be easier
    to manipulate your pandas dataframe with Python operations instead (*or, in addition
    to*). I, personally, like to have a mix of both languages to structure my data.
    At a certain point, it can be more efficient to work with operations once you
    have an already queried dataframe from SQL. For example, you might query all your
    necessary columns, and then read in your dataframe, then apply the respective
    operations to organize your data before it will ultimately be ingested into your
    data science model. With that being said, let’s dive a little deeper into some
    simple operations that might make your everyday work a little easier.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This following operation is “lesser than”, so you can write your dataframe alias,
    which in this case, is just df. You can insert the column name where I have placed
    ‘column_1’. I have assigned a new dataframe, named df_less_than_20, so that I
    only have records/rows that are the column value that is less than 20.

    can be even more beneficial — as we will see below.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was aware of the AND operation, but the OR was actually a recent operation
    that I found that has been incredibly useful, especially when filtering out data
    for accuracy and error analysis after your model is run. Of course, you can use
    this operation before that step of the process as well.

    and positive 100.

    as well:'

    on another column with another value as well.

- en: Lastly, we have another way to filter our data by selecting rows where there
    is a certain value or there is not a certain value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These two operations look like the following
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To summarize, we saw that we could combine a few of the operations that we discussed
    above to create a filtered dataset or pandas dataframe. Ultimately, this type
    of coding might be easier for some data scientists, who prefer to work in Python
    rather than in SQL.
