- en: As the cornerstone of the 21st century technological revolution, data science
    is seen as the future of every industry. But a closer look reveals that data science
    as a discipline will only have been around for a short time, a transition between
    a data-poor past and a future dominated by intelligent systems.

- en: Not long ago, we were plagued with sparse data and high data storage costs.
    Fast forward today. Due to our newfound digital mainstays, including the internet,
    social media, e-commerce, and IoT devices, we are continuously flooded with data.
    Data science has evolved into a tool for gaining insights, predicting trends,
    and making decisions during the onset of this era of big data, helping us make
    sense of these massive datasets. The era of big data has now fully come to pass,
    and we have firmly settled into it.

    The focus is no longer the vast amounts of data we generate non-stop; we have
    turned our attention to the ever-proliferating complex data-fuelled AI systems.
    The key question is no longer just "What insights can I derive from this data?"
    We instead ask "What AI system can I run with this data?" The last decade has
    focused on mastering big data. Next, we promise to move on to designing and implementing
    more powerful AI systems.

    the AI ​​career path: the *other* AI-powered singularity. It''s no longer just
    about the ability to analyze data, it''s also about building, training and maintaining
    AI systems that can learn, adapt and make autonomous decisions. This consolidation
    of roles represents an increasingly AI-centric situation.'

- en: To see this change in action, just look at OpenAI's ChatGPT project. Initially,
    the project focused on collecting and organizing large amounts of data to train
    models. However, the focus soon shifted to attempt to create and improve large-scale
    systems capable of generating meaningful, contextual natural language responses.
    Interactions between data and systems will become more dynamic, and AI will use
    data in increasingly complex and innovative ways.

- en: And imagine a future where AI-powered smart cities are the norm. The unseemly
    amounts of data that will be generated from sensors, devices, human interactions,
    and beyond will be consumed by AIs to control traffic flow, energy consumption,
    public safety, and more. This goes beyond data analysis. It's about developing
    giant AI systems that can understand and manage complex urban ecosystems.

- en: Data science may appear to be evolving into a branch of contemporary AI, and
    that's because, well, it is. But fret not, as this is but an evolutionary step
    to keep pace with the evolving technology landscape, much like the emergence of
    data science from statistics to handle the once-emerging "big data." Just as statistics
    are an integral part of data science, data science itself will continue to play
    an important role in an AI-driven future.

    though its destination is not yet obvious. The direction, however, is clear: future
    careers in the tech industry require understanding data not just in isolation,
    but as the lifeblood of sophisticated and versatile AI systems. Against this backdrop,
    data science will eventually be looked back upon and viewed as a major milestone
    along the road to an AI-centric future. Make no mistake, however; data science
    as its own entity *will* eventually be looked back upon.'

    world, keep an eye out for its inevitable consumption of data science. Just as
    the *data* is now big, so too are our *aspirations* for the systems that it can
    foster.
