- en: The newest plague — or partner — of educational systems is ChatGPT. News outlets
    are scrambling to gather teachers’ opinions on whether this phenomenon should
    be embraced or discarded because of how much it could change the educational landscape.
    How are students leveraging this tool for their studies? How are teachers supposed
    to react to ChatGPT in education?

    with simple experimentation or a YouTube tutorial, unless someone’s looking for
    more in-depth ways to bank on its resources. That’s its first boon, but several
    others could make it a valuable educational tool.

    like ChatGPT than mainstream methods. It could be an audio-visual assistant where
    students can freely ask as many clarifying questions as necessary without judgment.
    Teachers juggling countless individualized education plans could also take advantage
    of ChatGPT by asking how to curate lesson plans for students with disabilities
    or other learning requirements.

    covalent bonds or metaphors in literature. It could simplify complex concepts,
    giving step-by-step instructions when a classroom may not have the attention or
    time to devote to reiterating every idea in minute detail.

    if they need to catch up. ChatGPT’s ability to make curated responses is unparalleled,
    so if a student needs a scientific explanation for a sixth-grade reading level,
    ChatGPT can adapt.

    toughest, but students and teachers input countless data daily into its database.
    Are educational systems liable if threat actors compromise that information? Is
    it the educators’ responsibility to teach their subjects and cybersecurity hygiene
    on top of it, especially if they encourage using AI in the classroom? Cloud-based
    and public systems like this could have [improved cybersecurity and compliance](https://www.box.com/resources/what-is-cloud-security),

    need to exercise problem-solving skills if they can ask ChatGPT to decide for
    them? A want for instant gratification may take over the genuine curiosity to
    learn that was necessary for students who had to expend more effort to come up
    with the solutions they needed.

    with technology. Teachers calling for outright bans insinuate they can’t trust
    children to use ChatGPT for genuine educational purposes. Is it healthy for teachers
    to distrust students this way? Alternatively, is it beneficial for teachers to
    constantly question if students abuse their trust? Both sides pose a puzzling
    ethical question educators don’t have an answer to yet.
