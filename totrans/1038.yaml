    exploring the potential of data to make business processes more intuitive and
    bring a hyper-personalized experience to their customers. As driven enterprises
    are seeing success in today’s digital world, investments in the data analytics
    market are [set to reach $103 billion by 2023](https://techjury.net/blog/big-data-statistics/#gref).
    As businesses are eagerly trying to fetch more valuable and actionable insights
    from their data, the increase in the amount of data and data sources is also rapidly
    growing and expanding. It is getting increasingly complex to continue the data
    management strategy of integrating data from disparate sources to a centralized
    location i.e., (a data lake or data warehouse) because centralized data in a data
    warehouse or data lake requires analysis by a specialized team.

    different domains across an enterprise. The domains are handled autonomously to

    data warehouse or data [lake models does not scale](https://towardsdatascience.com/sorry-data-lakes-are-not-legacy-625bc70b4090)
    well. As the quantity of data increases, the complexity involved in data management
    also increases. In a traditional data lake architecture, data coming from varied
    sources becomes difficult for data consumers down the line to interpret. The consumers
    then must go back to the data producer to try and understand the data. With more
    integration of multiple platforms and lack of structure and ownership of data
    over time becomes a big obstacle in the data lake architecture.

- en: The data mesh architecture advocates data ownership in each team to create,
    handle and store the data. This helps other domains to avoid the bottleneck of
    a single, central enterprise-wide [data warehouse or data lake](/2018/05/data-lakes-data-warehousing-integration-revolution.html).
    This decoupling of centralized data makes enterprise-grade scaling a possibility
    when teams serve their own data needs at speed and scale bringing innovation across
    the domains quickly.

- en: A central pipeline gives teams less control over quality over increasing volumes
    of data but as data mesh architecture allows each team to use their own warehouses
    and lakes, and create and manage their domain data, thus teams have more incentive
    and ownership to ensure the quality of their data products before further distribution.
    This architecture brings more accountability and collaboration among different
    teams within an enterprise.

    data across multiple technologies and platforms, but it is more is technology-centric,
    while a data mesh focuses on organizational change. The data mesh ecosystem builds
    knowledge into domain teams, encouraging domain teams to deliver optimal business
    value within their own areas of expertise. This type of ecosystem breaks the common
    myth that one needs to centralize data for it to be useful. As data is centralized
    from varied sources, the meaning of data from the source is sometimes modified.
    This issue can be resolved with the data mesh, as domain [teams view data-as-a-product](https://www.k2view.com/blog/data-as-a-product/)
    and handle their own data pipelines. They are further able to supply data products
    themselves and offer them centrally.

- en: As the volumes and types of data grow, the data teams become overwhelmed, and
    businesses get less and less value from their data investments. Hence, data mesh
    architecture is ideal for larger enterprises with data flowing from multiple sources
    which are diverse and mutable. Business initiatives should be aligned closely
    with domain teams to fetch valuable insights from the domain-specific data. Such
    alignment helps domain teams to create quality that delivers real business value.

    implementing data mesh architecture. These platforms like in traditional data
    management architecture integrate data from all sources and make it into any number
    of data products and create a data mesh. Data management platforms offer secure
    distribution of data among any number of domains and provide data quality control,
    privacy, and access, at any level of federation.

    architecture. It provides the ability to handle a diverse and huge volume of data
    which makes it a better approach compared to other data architectures. The domain-specific
    structures in the data mesh help to generate valuable insights from mounting chunks
    of data. The ownership of data with teams translates into greater scope for data
    experimentation and innovation. Netflix, embraced data mesh architecture to integrate
    and manage data across hundreds of different data stores. Refer to this [Youtube
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO_IiN06jJ4) to understand Netflix Data
    Mesh. This new way of creating a network of domain teams who own their data and
    handle it as a product helps get more value out of their data operations.
