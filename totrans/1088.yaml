    and how trusted it is to make trusted decisions. It is made up of characteristics
    such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, and timeliness.

    is data cleaning. Data cleaning consists of different types of techniques based
    on the type of data and the problems identified in the data.

  prefs: []

- en: 1\. Standardise
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Putting data in the same standardised format helps you clean the data and identify
    errors in the data. For example, making sure all string values are either in lower
    case or upper case to stop confusion is a good start.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensuring that numerical values are all the same measurement in that specific
    column, to a single unit. For example, a patient's weight can typically be in
    pounds (lbs) or kilograms (kg). Setting them all to the same measurement makes
    the analyst's life a little bit easier.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scaling the data means transforming it so that it fits within a specific scale,
    like 0-100 or 0-1\. By scaling we can plot, compare, and analyse the data better.
    For example, converting the number of visits a user comes to the gym can be converted
    from an integer to a percentage, showing how much they made use of the gym for
    a specific period.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normalisation is the process of reorganising the data so that there is no duplicated
    data and that the data is stored in one place. The point of normalisation is changing
    your observations so that they can be described as a normal distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people confuse standardising data and normalising data as the same, however,
    they are not. Normalisation typically rescales the values into a range of [0,1],
    whereas Standardisation typically rescales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard
    deviation of 1.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    ignoring them just makes your problem worst. There are different ways you can
    deal with them.

    values occur at random.'

    these are not guaranteed as ‘unbiased’ data.

    existing data between two variables to fill in the missing value.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Filling in missing values is arguably controversial when data is used to make
    important decisions, statistical analysis, and provide facts to the rest of society.
    The data that is missing has value and is informative. For example, if a survey
    is conducted and users from a specific age group or religious group refuse to
    answer a question. The reason behind the missing values is important and informative
    to the survey conductor when asking an analyst to find correlations and outputs.

    these are important and may allow further analysis for current and future purposes.

    the data, and making sure that the cleaning process has not violated any rules
    or parameters is important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Passing data on or moving onto the next stage without having reported the quality
    of the data is as important as the cleaning process. There are software and libraries
    that can detect and report these changes, showing if any rules were violated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reporting the errors in the data allows the business to identify why they occurred
    in the first place, if the data is of use anymore and how it can be avoided in
    the future.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may sit there for hours on ends trying to clean data, to the point you may
    get frustrated. However, there is no point analysing bad data. Band-aid solutions
    do not deal with the cause of the problem. You have to understand the problem
    at hand and figure out what is the best way to fix it.
