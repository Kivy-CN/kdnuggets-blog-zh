    is not possible. Sometimes I tell myself “I don’t know anything”, to push myself
    to learn and continuously improve.

    is always room for improvement. It’s difficult to keep on top of things and feel
    a sense of accomplishment in the world of Data Science. Once you have finished
    learning one thing and feel confident about it, you catch yourself finding new
    topics or areas to learn.

    who have worked in the sector for 10+ years still have to google how to join two
    datasets. It doesn’t mean they don’t know it, they may have just not had to use
    that code in a while and they have forgotten.

    other Data Scientists, Analysts, Machine Learning Engineers, and more bouncing
    off knowledge from one another. However, there will come a point where you may
    not know something that your colleague does, vice versa. However, telling your
    colleague you know something when you have no idea can be a detriment to your
    confidence at times.

    simply using Google, watching a YouTube video, or looking at Stack Overflow. However,
    if you continue to keep telling your colleagues or boss that you know something,
    and you don’t know; you will find yourself drowning in extra learning. Instead,
    you could have just said “Sorry, but I don’t know how to do this”. This way, your
    colleagues and boss understand your strength and weaknesses, providing you with
    the right support/training in order for you to improve in particular areas.

    you need fundamental skills. If you are a Data Scientist who enjoys data wrangling,
    creating data visualisations but have little experience in building Machine Learning
    models; this is a weakness of yours that you can work on. Admitting to yourself
    that you won't be advanced in every skill available at the hands of Data Scientists
    is the first step of growing as a Data Scientist.

    you don’t know; you can narrow down your self-development. If you are particularly
    interested in becoming a Machine Learning Engineer, your skills as a Data Scientist
    will come in handy. However, you will need to look into learning areas such as
    Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, and more.

    or in the future. If your career plans require you to use Python and R as programming
    languages, learning another language such as HTML won't be useful. You don’t want
    to be a rookie in everything, and a master in nothing.

- en: If you don’t ask, you don’t get. Data Scientist roles require a heavy ton of
    technical skills, alongside soft skills. It is unfortunate, but many people will
    assume that you will know how to do pretty much everything because you applied
    for a specific role. As we already know, that is not the case. There is always
    room for improvement and time to learn different skills.

    complete a particular task to fast track the process, however, you don’t know
    how to attend to it because you don’t possess these kinds of skills. You will
    find yourself in a pickle. Speaking up and informing your colleagues what you
    can and cannot do, rather than feeling nervous and ashamed will save you in the
    long run. You may be allocated another task in which the other team members are
    aware you are comfortable doing, ensuring everyone will meet the deadline.

    of self-development. The company may want you to improve on these and have you
    undergo specific training or allocate you self-development time during work hours
    to support you. If a company can help you become one of the best Data Scientists,
    they will.

    Instead of spending the day, doing simpler tasks where you could be of benefit
    in another area is important. This is the easiest way to climb up the ladder.
    Speaking to your Senior about your strengths and how they could improve the efficiency
    of the company can resolve many of the business’s issues. It’s a win-win situation.

    first step to building your career. The keyword to take from that is ‘building’.
    It’s not going to be handed to you, so you will have to start from somewhere.
