    Agreements." Figure 7 provides an example where job postings 1 and 2 mention the
    "Non-Discrimination" policy. These sentences are not relevant to our analysis
    and therefore need to be removed from our text corpus. We refer to them as "Stop
    Phrases" and employ two methods to identify and filter them.

    in our corpus and eliminate any sentences with a frequency greater than 10.'

    values from 20 to 40\. We select a value for N and assess the relevance of N-grams
    derived from the corpus by counting the number of N-grams that classify as stop
    phrases. We repeat this process for each value of N within the range. We chose
    N=35 as the best value for N to identify the highest number of Stop Phrases.

    interpret the topics (skill sets) by reviewing the keywords (skills) and their
    respective weights. We explored a range [1, 10] for k and fixed the value of m=15\.
    After careful analysis, we found that k=7 led to the most diverse and distinct
    topics with a minimum overlap in keywords. Thus, we determined k=7 to be the optimal
    value for our analysis.
