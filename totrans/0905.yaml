    (varying degrees of sarcasm intended for each of those common points of detraction),
    ChatGPT can also be very useful for the average data scientist in their day to
    day life.

- en: 'The problem that we are currently grappling with is one of expectations: some
    expect that ChatGPT is nothing more than a stochastic parrot that produces rubbish
    and is completely useless, while others seem to think (either pessimistically
    or optimistically, depending on who you ask) that ChatGPT will be taking over
    the world, while either ridding us of monotony or laying waste to human civilization.
    If we all tempered our expectations and recognized this technology for what it
    is, and what it could be useful for, we would all be far better off. But in the
    era of outrage and hyperbole, nuance takes a back seat to hot takes. But I digress.'

    technologies are [going to transform the world in which we live](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/10/bill-gates-says-ai-like-chatgpt-is-the-most-important-innovation.html).
    But that''s not necessarily a bad thing: if you learn to leverage and master ChatGPT
    and other LLM innovations in the same vein *now*, you are a step ahead of the
    game. Not learning how to use the machine is the greatest threat the machine poses
    to you or your career, so wrangle the robot now, and be a leader in these everchanging
