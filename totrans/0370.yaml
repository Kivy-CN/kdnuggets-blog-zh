    impossible to have all the knowledge in your head. Especially if some of this
    knowledge you use only occasionally. Also, if you’re a beginner in a certain field,
    you’ll have to refresh very often what you learned until it becomes actual knowledge
    at the crossroads of theory and practice.

    would be pretty helpful, right? That ‘something’ is called a cheat sheet. And
    it has nothing to do with cheating. They are used for learning and revisioning
    what you already know.

- en: Due to their intention of being (relatively) concise and high-level, having
    one cheat sheet for the whole data science would beat its (the cheat sheet’s,
    not data science’s) purpose. Even if creating such a cheat sheet would be possible.
    Because of that, you’ll have to use different cheat sheets for the various data
    science fields.
