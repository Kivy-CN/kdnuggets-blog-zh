- en: Lately, I had a chance to present a tech talk about [Dash Python framework](https://plot.ly/products/dash/).
    Dash is a reactive framework for building Dashboards. They are like ones build
    using [Shiny R framework](https://appsilondatascience.com/blog/rstats/2016/12/28/make-shiny-awesome.html).
    At Appsilon we’ve already build complex dashboards in Shiny. We also deployed
    them for [thousands of users](https://appsilondatascience.com/blog/rstats/2017/10/17/scaling-shiny.html).

- en: Python community is catching up and we are happy to explore opportunities. It
    is worth to compare the two. We’ve started with several internal tests. We already
    delivered Dash projects for most innovative clients. Starting today we deliver
    business projects written in Dash for a broader audience. Below you can see a
    quick summary of our lessons learned!
