    information and transforming the data into a desirable format. Data preparation
    is an essential step in the machine learning process because it allows the data
    to be used by the machine learning algorithms to create an accurate model or prediction.

    model. If the data has small discrepancies or missing information, then it can
    have a great impact on your model's accuracy. Therefore, it is essential to have
    quality data that you can use to train your models.

    is devoted to data preparation. As a result, the field of data mining has placed
    great emphasis on developing techniques for obtaining high-quality data. (Zhang,

    skew the rest of your data. There are a number of challenges that come with noisy
    data. The traditional solutions don’t always work with big data. They aren’t scalable,
    and the advantages of big data can be lost if you apply simple solutions like
    mean, which doesn’t account for all the complexity of the data.

    files. These files are stored in different places, and they are in a format that's
    easy to use. Since they are collected from lots of places (like cell phone videos
    on YouTube), they can give you different views on the same thing. These views
    are heterogeneous because they have been collected from people in different groups.

    can be used. Instance reduction reduces the quantity of information by removing
    instances from data sets or by generating new ones. Instance reduction allows
    researchers to decrease the size of very large data sets without decreasing the
    knowledge and quality of information they can extract from them.

- en: There are different approaches to tackling the problem of missing values. First,
    we can discard instances that have missing values. But this is rarely beneficial
    because we are ignoring significant information. Another approach is to attribute
    the missing values. This is usually done using machine learning techniques that
    model the probability functions of the data set. Max-likelihood procedures can
    then be applied to find the best imputation model.

    guide has offered you a better understanding of the difference between raw and
    processed data. The first step in learning how to prepare your data will depend
    on what type of data you are using. However, making sure that your data is as
    accurate and clean as possible is important when it comes to modeling. Make sure
    to always keep these data preparation tips in mind while beginning any statistical
    project, whether simple or complex.
