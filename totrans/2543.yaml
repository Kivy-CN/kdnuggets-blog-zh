    back, the internet was nothing as compared to today. Like the internet, the next
    big thing which is supposed to revolutionize the world is **Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)**.

- en: When you hear Artificial Intelligence, the first thing that comes to your mind
    is probably the intelligent robot that can make its own decision based on the
    situation. In actuality, AI has a lot more applications than just creating a robot.
    Although sci-fi movies and [the creepy Facebook AI incident](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/facebook-researchers-shut-down-ai-bots-that-started-speaking-in-a-language-unintelligible-to-humans-3876197.html)
    have made a negative image of artificial intelligence in the general people’s
    minds, in reality, AI has many more positive uses than adverse ones, only if used
    judicially.

    (ML)**. Many people use the term AI and ML as a synonym, which is factually incorrect,
    even though both these terms are closely related to each other. ***While AI is
    a concept to design an intelligent system that can replicate human intelligence
    and make its own decisions, ML is actually a subset of AI that helps machines
    learn from the data to improve and amplify their decision-making.***

    new techniques to breach the tight security of the organization and attack their
    systems with malicious codes and programs. The threats such as ransomware, spyware,
    [social engineering attacks](https://www.viruspup.com/kb/social-engineering-attack-guide.html),
    trojans, etc., are continuously growing and making the internet a spooky place
    for the general user.

    for cybersecurity experts to deal with them. On top of that, user’s reluctance
    to regularly update their devices is worsening the case. In recent times, the
    evolution of AI and Machine Learning has aided cybercriminals too. These technologies
    are illicitly used to find out the system vulnerabilities and quickly plan a suitable
    attack. Using machine learning, cyber attackers are able to find the high-value
    target from the database of thousands and millions.

- en: When it comes to cybersecurity, AI and ML can be highly beneficial in dealing
    with modern threats. Many security programs providers already use these modern
    technologies in their threat detecting engines to make cybersecurity more automated
    and human-risk-free. You will find many areas in cybersecurity that can utilize
    the power of AI and ML for more efficacy. The basic principle of AI technology
    is data grouping, categorization, processing, filtering, and managing. The security
    apps like antivirus and antimalware use almost the same rule.

    like Zero-day attacks, DDoS attacks, and other similar advanced attacks cannot
    be prevented by the traditional security program. For them, you require modern
    security solutions known as Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV). NGAV is a security
    program based on machine learning and artificial intelligence that can pre-detect
    any potential threat and notify users about it.
