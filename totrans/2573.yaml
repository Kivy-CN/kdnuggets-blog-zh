- en: One of the most crucial aspects of landing your desired role in data science
    is building a strong, potent, eye-catching portfolio that proves your skills and
    shows that you can handle large-scale projects and play nicely in a team. Your
    portfolio needs to prove that you spent the time, effort, and resources to hone
    your skills as a data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Proving your skills to someone who doesn’t know you, especially in a short time
    frame — the average time a recruiter spends on a resume or a portfolio is 7~10
    seconds — is not easy. However, it’s not impossible either.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good portfolio should include various types of projects, projects about data
    collecting, analytics, and visualization. It should also contain projects of different
    sizes. Dealing with small projects is very different than dealing with large-scale
    ones. If your portfolio has both sizes, then it means you can read, handle and
    debug all size software, which is a skill required for any data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That may lead you to wonder how you would find good open-source data science
    projects that are easy to get into and look great on your portfolio. And that’s
    a great question, but with the exploding number of data science projects out there,
    finding good ones that could be the thing that lands you the job is not the easiest
    of tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you try looking up data science projects to contribute to, you will often
    come across the big ones, like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. These giant projects
    are great, but there are less known ones that are still used by many data scientists
    and will look good on your resume.

- en: Let’s kick this list off with a project from the tech giant Google. Often when
    building and developing data science projects, you may find it difficult to build
    a test environment that will show you your project in a real-life situation. You
    can’t predict all scenarios, and make sure to cover all edge cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google offers Caliban as a potential solution for that problem. Caliban is a
    testing tool that tracks your environmental properties during execution and allows
    you to reproduce specific running environments. Researchers and data engineers
    developed this tool at Google that performs this task on a daily basis.

- en: Next on our list is PalmerPenguins, a dataset that was only recently open-sourced.
    This dataset was built and developed to replace the very well-known and used Iris
    dataset. The reason behind Iris’s fame is its simplicity of use for beginners
    and also the wide variety of its possible applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PalmerPenguins offers an amazing dataset that you can use for data visualization
    and classification applications with the same ease as you would use Iris, but
    with much more options. One more great aspect of this dataset is that it offers
    art to teach data science concepts.

- en: Next up, we have one of the promising frameworks for deep learning out there,
    Caffe. Caffe is a deep learning framework that was designed and built with speed,
    modularity, and expression as priorities. Caffe was originally developed by a
    team of researchers from the UC Berkeley AI lab and the vision and learning community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After only one year of releasing Caffe as an open-source project, it was forked
    by more than 1000 researchers and developers around the world. It helped transform
    research topics and build new startups and industrial forces. The Caffe community
    is one of the welcoming, supportive open-source communities to join.

- en: Machine learning is probably the heart of data science applications, so I had
    to have at least one open-source project solely for machine learning. NeoML is
    a machine learning framework that allows the user to design, built, test, and
    deploy machine learning models hassle-free with a collection of more than 20 traditional
    machine learning algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It includes materials that support natural language processing, computer vision,
    neural networks, and image classification and processing. This framework is written
    in C++, Java, and Objective-C and can run on any platform from Unix-based ones,
    macOS, and Windows.

- en: We’ll conclude our list with Kornia. Kornia is a supporting computer vision
    library for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). It includes various routines and
    differentiable that can be used to solve some generic computer vision problems.
    Kornia is built upon PyTorch and heavily depends on its efficiency and CPU power
    to compute complex functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kornia is more than just a package; it is a set of libraries that can be used
    together to train models and neural networks and perform image transformation,
    image filtering, and edge detection.

    to decipher the job role’s names and figure out which role fits your skills better
    and what you would like to do, it's time to think of how to make your portfolio
    land you that job with no delay.

    journey, from smaller ones with a few lines of code to relatively large ones with
    hundreds of lines. But, to really prove your skills and knowledge level, you need
    to have some contributions that will make you stand out in the applicants' pool.
  prefs: []

    used by many data scientists all over the world.
