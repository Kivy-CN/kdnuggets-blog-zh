  zh: 我为什么选择学习数据科学？
- en: It was the spring of 2016 and I was coming towards the end of a 6 month internship
    at one of the largest consulting firms in the City of London. I had taken this
    role to gain experience and figure out whether becoming an Actuary was the correct
    route for my career. I quickly found passion in the data analytics of the role
    as I was being pulled into meetings to discuss numbers I had crunched or was able
    hack together a tool to automate previously manual tasks. However, I also found
    that the traditional track I would be heading on if I moved onto the graduate
    scheme no longer interested me due to years of standardised exams and little to
    no creativity. Furthermore, most of my work at this point was within Excel and
    I was gaining little to no coding experience.

  zh: 那是2016年的春天，我快结束在伦敦市最大咨询公司之一的6个月实习了。我接受这个角色是为了获得经验，并弄清楚成为精算师是否是我职业生涯的正确方向。我很快发现自己对这个角色的数据分析产生了兴趣，因为我被拉去参加会议，讨论我分析的数据，或者能够自己编写工具来自动化以前的手动任务。然而，我也发现如果我继续进入研究生项目，我将会沿着传统的轨道前进，这让我失去了兴趣，因为那需要多年标准化考试，几乎没有创造性。此外，在这一点上，我的大部分工作都在
    Excel 中进行，几乎没有获得编程经验。
- en: 'It was at this point I also started to explore a magical term that kept coming
    up in my job searches: *Data Science*. I had come from a background in mathematics
    and, due to the nature of the job market in the UK, had been nudged towards the
    well-founded traditional roles such as accountancy and actuarial consulting. And
    yet, here was a new role that defied all the expectations I had set for myself
    of my future career. Where becoming an Actuary I would be solving problems by
    learning regulatory standards, Data Scientists are encouraged to creatively find
    solutions that fit within the commercial environment. Furthermore, the role opportunities
    were no longer fixed into a few select firms but almost all companies were looking
    for some variation of a Data Scientist and the idea that I could move into a completely
    new industry, from fashion to finance, greatly appealed to my interests.'

  zh: 就在这时，我也开始探索一个在我的求职中经常出现的神奇术语：*数据科学*。我来自数学背景，由于英国就业市场的性质，我被推向了会计和精算咨询等传统角色。然而，现在有了一个新的角色，它违背了我对未来职业的所有期望。在成为精算师的过程中，我会通过学习监管标准来解决问题，而数据科学家则被鼓励在商业环境中创造性地寻找解决方案。此外，角色机会不再固定在少数几家公司几乎所有公司都在寻找某种形式的数据科学家，能够进入一个全新的行业，从时尚到金融，都极大地吸引了我的兴趣。

- en: The first solution was to simply teach these myself, I had the statistical experience
    to learn machine learning and had done enough coding in MatLab to feel confident
    that I could learn Python or R. However, if I was to do these I was unsure if
    this was enough and how I would clearly demonstrate my newly acquired skills on
    a CV to employers.

  zh: 第一个解决方案是自己教授这些内容，我有统计学经验来学习机器学习，并且在MatLab中有足够的编码经验，以至于我有信心可以学习Python或R。然而，如果我这样做的话，我不确定这是否足够，也不确定如何在简历上清晰地展示我新获得的技能给雇主。
- en: I considered online boot camps but they were often fixed in their content and
    I was unsure of how repeating someone else’s work would be received by employers.
    Furthermore, there was no guarantee that these were credible to employers and
    were expensive to self fund. Today, only three years later, the list of courses
    supported by universities makes this much more of a viable option and is something
    that is definitely worth considering but at the time these were lacking. Unfortunately,
    boot camps were a costly risk that I was uncertain would pay off.

  zh: 我考虑了在线训练营，但它们的内容通常是固定的，我不确定重复他人的工作会如何被雇主接受。此外，没有保证这些训练营对雇主来说是可信的，而且自费也很昂贵。今天，仅仅三年后，大学支持的课程列表使得这成为了一个更为可行的选择，绝对值得考虑，但当时这些课程还不够成熟。不幸的是，训练营是一个昂贵的风险，我不确定是否会有所回报。
- en: Therefore, I decided to look for the options available at universities. At the
    time there were two types of courses that fit within my goals; business analysts
    courses and computer science machine learning. The former focused on applying
    analytics within commercial environments but, as this was run through business
    schools, was far more expensive at over £25,000 for one year of studying. The
    latter provided the teaching through academic research and focused more on teaching
    the underlying theory than the application. Furthermore, as this was an academic
    course run through the Computer Science department, the cost was considerably
    less for the year at £9,000 (for UK citizen).

  zh: 因此，我决定寻找大学提供的选项。当时有两种类型的课程符合我的目标；商业分析课程和计算机科学中的机器学习。前者专注于在商业环境中应用分析，但由于这是通过商学院进行的，因此价格更高，一年的学费超过£25,000。后者通过学术研究提供教学，更侧重于教授基础理论而不是应用。此外，由于这是通过计算机科学系开设的学术课程，因此一年的学费大大减少，为£9,000（针对英国公民）。

- en: In the second term we had two core modules, Big Data and Neural Computing, and
    were given the choice of two optional modules. The list of options was comprehensive
    and enabled us to pick specialisms from computer vision to data architectures.
    I chose Data Visualisations (a continuation of the first term’s module) and Software
    Agents (the basics of AI by applying Reinforcement Learning). Again, these modules
    included coursework and with the fundamentals from the first term, I was really
    able to expand my applications and think creatively. Big Data also introduced
    text data and natural language processing.

    Data还介绍了文本数据和自然语言处理。

- en: The Masters opened up all the doors that I had previously been knocking on and
    even had recruiters contacting me directly following the projects I had posted
    publicly. In the end, I found that I enjoyed the research aspect of my dissertation
    and the freedom to pursue the field and have since move onto a PhD in Artificial
    Intelligence. Ironically, this is the last thing I would have considered back
    in 2016 but as the field is constantly expanding it is incredible to be at the
    forefront of this, particularly because many problems require an applied mindset
    and fit within commercial problems and are not simply theoretical.
