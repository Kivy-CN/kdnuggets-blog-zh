- en: Customers have many options for comparing and purchasing products in today's
    digital business world. To be the customer's first choice, you must first understand
    them, know what they expect from your product or service, and promptly resolve
    them. Customers are willing to switch brands in a heartbeat if they believe that
    you don't listen to their needs, even if you have an exceptional brand value.

    organizations that take a customer-centric approach are 60% more rewarding than
    companies that do not focus on the customer. So, what is a customer-centric strategy?
    It is nothing but putting your customers first, understanding what they want,
    and providing the best solution. Adopting a customer-centric culture is challenging,
    but it will be well worth it.

    companies aren't implementing it. The short answer is that most businesses attempt
    to be customer-centric but fail to achieve it. Nonetheless, the challenge is that
    almost all customer data comes from multiple touchpoints and lacks consistency
    and governance across departments.

    article, merely 3% of the organization's data was high-quality data. The poor
    and outdated data are nothing more than mere numbers. To effectively deliver customer-centric
    experiences, organizations should do everything from collecting relevant customer
    data to enriching, standardizing, and making it available immediately to everyone
