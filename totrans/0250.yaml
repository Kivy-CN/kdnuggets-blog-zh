- en: Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming the dominant trend in data ecosystems
    around the world, and by all counts, it will accelerate as the decade unfolds.
    The more the data community learns about AI and what it can do, the faster it
    empowers IT systems and structures. This is primarily why IDC predicts the market
    to [top $500 billion](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48127321)
    as early as 2024, with penetration across virtually all industries driving a wealth
    of applications and services designed to make work more effective. In fact, CB
    Insights Research reported that at the close of Q3 2021, funding for AI companies
    had already [surpassed 2020 levels](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-q3-2021/)
    by roughly 55%, setting a global record for the fourth consecutive quarter.

    hamper unstructured language data-driven processes, thanks to improvements in
    complex cognitive tasks such as natural language understanding (NLU). At the same
    time, there will be increased scrutiny into how and why AI does what it does,
    such as ongoing efforts by the U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) aimed at more [explainable AI](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2021/NIST.IR.8312.pdf).
    This will require greater transparency into AI’s algorithmic functions without
    diminishing its performance or raising costs.

- en: Of all the challenges that AI must cope with, understanding language is one
    of the toughest. While most AI solutions can crunch massive volumes of raw numbers
    or structured data in the blink of an eye, the multitude of meanings and nuances
    in language, based on the context they are in is another matter entirely. More
    often than not, words are contextual, which means they convey different understandings
    in different circumstances. Something easy and natural for our brains is not that
    easy for any piece of software.

    and reliably has become a critical factor in the development of AI across the

    wealth of language-based information. Language inhabits all aspects of enterprise
    activity, which means that an AI approach cannot be complete without extracting
    as much value as possible from this type of data.

- en: A knowledge-based, or symbolic AI approach, leverages a knowledge graph which
    is an open box. Its structure is created by humans and is understood to represent
    the real world where concepts are defined and related to each other by semantic
    relationships. Thanks to knowledge graphs and NLU algorithms, you can read and
    learn from any text, out-of-the-box, and gain a true understanding of how data
    is being interpreted and conclusions are being drawn from that interpretation.
    This is similar to how we as humans are able to create our own specific, domain-oriented
    knowledge, and it enables AI projects to link its algorithmic results to explicit
    representations of knowledge.

- en: In 2022, we should see a definitive shift toward this kind of AI approach combining
    both different techniques. Hybrid AI leverages different techniques to improve
    overall results and better tackle complex cognitive problems. Hybrid AI is an
    increasingly popular approach for NLU and natural language processing (NLP). Bringing
    together the best of AI-based knowledge or symbolic AI and learning models (machine
    learning, ML) is the most effective way to unlock the value of unstructured language
    data with the accuracy, speed and scale required by today’s businesses.

    produce more accurate results and a more efficient, effective AI environment,
    it will also reduce the need for cumbersome and resource-intensive training, based
    on wasteful volumes of documents on expensive, high-speed data infrastructure.
    Domain-specific knowledge can be added through subject matter experts and/or machine
    learning algorithms leveraging the analysis of small and pinpointed training sets
    of data to produce highly accurate, actionable results quickly and efficiently.

- en: But why is this transition happening now? Why hasn’t AI been able to harness
    language-based knowledge previously? We have been led to believe that learning
    approaches can solve any of our problems. In some cases, they can, but just because
    ML does well with certain needs and specific contexts doesn’t mean it is always
    the best method. And we see this all too often when it comes to the ability to
    understand and process language. Only in the past few years have we seen significant
    advancements in NLU based on hybrid (or composite) AI approaches.

- en: Rather than throwing one form of AI, with its limited set of tools, at a problem,
    we can now utilize multiple, different approaches. Each can target the problem
    from a different angle, using different models, to evaluate and solve the issue
    in a multi-contextual way. And since each of these techniques can be evaluated
    independently of one another, it becomes easier to determine which ones deliver
    the most optimal outcomes.

    approach is poised to become a strategic initiative in 2022\. It produces significant
    time and cost benefits, while boosting the speed, accuracy and efficiency of analytical
    and operational processes. To take just one example, the process of annotation
    is currently performed by select experts, in large part due to the difficulty
    and expense of training. By combining the proper knowledge repositories and graphs,
    however, the training can be vastly simplified so that the process itself can
    be democratized among the knowledge workforce.

    apply these hybrid models to some of their most core processes. Business automation
    in the form of email management and search is already in sight. The current keyword-based
    search approach, for instance, is inherently incapable of absorbing and interpreting
    entire documents, which is why they can only extract basic, largely non-contextual
    information. Likewise, automation email management systems can rarely penetrate
    meaning beyond simple product names and other points of information. In the end,
    users are left to sort through a long list of hits trying to find the salient
    pieces of knowledge. This slows down processes, delays decision-making and ultimately
    hampers productivity and revenue.
