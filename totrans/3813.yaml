- en: In software engineering, in general, writing documentation refers to the process
    where the programmer of the main developer of the code writes a script explaining
    in detail what the code does, its goal, and how it achieves that. The main reason
    programmers hate to write documentation is that, as a programmer, you would instead
    write code than an explanation of it.

    to understand, even if they are not professional programmers. And as we all know
    — maybe not all — programmers are good at writing code but bad at explaining its
    theory.

    to use. They will probably need to clone it from GitHub, install it using pip,
    or download it from the official website.

    installed many libraries during their careers. However, what if a new programmer
    is trying to use your project? They may need a little help.

  zh: 对于经验丰富的程序员来说，这可能显得很简单；毕竟，他们在职业生涯中安装了许多库。然而，如果一个新程序员试图使用你的项目呢？他们可能需要一些帮助。
- en: After describing your project and what it does, the following should be a "Getting
    Started" section. That section's primary goal is to provide the user with simple
    steps to installing the project and running a small example proving it was installed
    correctly.

    it's time to dig deep and start using it. Good documentation will often contain
    tutorials about the different use cases of the project and how to get it done
    using the project's inner functions.

- en: Many tutorials don't equal good documentation; it's not about quantity but quality.
    However, some projects have a few tutorials highlighting the project's usage,
    clearly stating how it can be extended to apply to other cases. This means the
    user only needs to read 2 or 3 tutorials to understand the project's code's inner
    workings.

    the purpose of the function/class, showing its type, the common types of its attributes,

- en: You must think the term "good documentation" is very vague and depends on the
    person. For example, I might see some documentation as good and helpful, while
    you may think the opposite. If we can't set rigid rules to what makes good documentation,
    *how can we decide if documentation is good?*
  id: totrans-40
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simple answer to that is feedback. Most modern documentation often includes
    a "*give us feedback*" section. Users can contact the programmer about missing
    or inaccurate information in the documentation to make it better and more helpful.
