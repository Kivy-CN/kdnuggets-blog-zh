    (ML), grows and more engineers enter this popular field, the lack of de facto
    standards and frameworks for how work should be done is becoming more apparent.
    A new focus on optimizing the ML delivery pipeline is starting to gain momentum.

    and it is a non-trivial task ensuring that their work survives the delivery process.
    Of course, this isn’t a new problem: in the past, traditional software development
    teams would throw their work “over the wall” to the operations team to serve in
    production with little to no context. A community effort to solve the inevitable
    mess resulted in what we now think of as DevOps, removing the wall between development
    and operations to drive increased efficiency and improve product quality. New
    tools and processes to help teams implement streamlined delivery pipelines now
    help guarantee development/production parity.'
