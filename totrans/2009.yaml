    machine learning algorithms. A data engineer's main focus is ensuring that the
    algorithms built work effectively in production infrastructure and creating data
    pipelines.

- en: Data engineers are responsible for everything surrounding the organization's
    data infrastructure. This infrastructure will store the business's critical information,
    ranging from small databases to large-scale systems. The aim is to ensure that
    the data's foundation is solid and secure in order for critical analysis to be
    performed and reports can be produced.
