- en: The majority of debates, discussions, and flame wars regarding the programming
    languages for data science tend to focus on [Python and R](https://www.kdnuggets.com/tag/python-vs-r).
    While these may be the 2 most used languages in the space, that doesn't mean that
    they are the *only* options available, nor does it mean that they are even necessarily
    the "best" choices. One additional option, among many, is [Julia](https://julialang.org/),
    a fast, dynamic, open source general purpose programming language which is seen
    as a [desirable data science skill](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/09/modern-data-science-skills.html)
    to consider adopting.

    for data science is the book **[Statistics with Julia: Fundamentals for Data Science,
    Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](https://statisticswithjulia.org/StatisticsWithJuliaDRAFT.pdf)**,
    written by Yoni Nazarathy and Hayden Klok, and currently in draft form. The book''s

    of there being other more widely embraced options out there. It's best to address
    this before moving on, and we do so with this excerpt from the book's first chapter.

    suited for statistics, machine learning, data science, as well as for light and
    heavy numerical computational tasks. It can also be integrated in user-level applications,
    however one would not typically use it for front-end interfaces, or game creation.
    It is an open-source language and platform, and the Julia community brings together
    contributors from the scientific computing, statistics, and data-science worlds.
    This puts the Julia language and package system in a good place for combining
    mainstream statistical methods with methods and trends of the scientific computing
    world.

    read this book?'
  prefs:

- en: '**Answer**: Statistics or probability knowledge is not pre-assumed. Hence,
    this book is a self-contained guide for the core principles of probability, statistics,
    machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. It is ideally suited
    for engineers, data-scientists, or science professionals, wishing to strengthen
    their core probability, statistics, and data science knowledge while exploring
    the Julia language. However, general mathematical notation and results including
    basics from linear algebra, calculus, and discrete mathematics are used.'

    programming for statistics: is knowledge of programming a prerequisite; is knowledge
    of statistics a prerequisite? The answer for both of these ends up being *no*,
    making this a resource truly befitting a beginner.'

- en: The book's section 1.3, *Crash Course by Example*, is a great place to start
    your Julia voyage if you are inexperienced with the language. After a quick once-over
    of the linguistic basics in the previous section, you jump right into coding with
    some non-trivial examples, including bubble sort, string manipulation, JSON parsing,
    and Markov chain steady states.

    generation and Monte Carlo simulations, followed by integrating Julia with other
    languages. The book gets into statistical concepts in the next chapter, and from
    that point onward the concepts build upon one another, leading up to more advanced
    topics such as statistical inference, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing,
    linear regression, machine learning, and more.
