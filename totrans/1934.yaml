    help Netflix in identifying inventory gaps? Does Discovery & Personalization team
    provide any inputs to Content Acquisition team?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[**Joseph Babcock**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephjbabcock): In a sense
    content acquisition is both a science and an art. While it is difficult to exactly
    pin down what makes a show a hit, we make extensive use of analytics in examining
    what our users are watching, and thus where we might want to prioritize our licensing
    in the future. Examples include building predictive models for popularity of upcoming
    titles, using expert tagging to assign metadata labels to content, and qualitative
    interview sessions conducted by our Consumer Sciences branch to link these empirical
    findings with feedback from our customers.'

    in conjunction with our marketing efforts to constantly refine our delivery of

    to manage Big Data?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![aws-s3](../Images/e0624a659b7139956f70725abf15062c.png)**JB:** Our Big Data
    infrastructure is primarily built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically
    the Simple Storage Service (S3) file system that backs our Hadoop cluster. Production
    ETL jobs are largely written in Pig, with Hive used for adhoc analyses and Presto
    for interactive analytics. We also maintain a Teradata cloud instance, which is
    the backend for many of our reporting tools such as Microstrategy and Tableau.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hadoop job submission is managed through a service developed in-house called
    Genie, which abstracts the details of cluster configuration when users submit
    jobs (it resembles submission of a POST command to a web server). Along with Genie,
    you can find many of our other Big Data tools on Github, such as Inviso (a central
    dashboard to visualize cluster load and debug job performance), S3mper (an S3
    consistency monitor), Lipstick (a visual interface for Pig which we utilize extensively
    for sharing and analyzing data about these jobs), PigPen (a Clojure wrapper for
    Pig), and Surus (a collection of User Defined Functions (UDFs) developed for data
    science tasks such as model scoring and anomaly detection).

    aspects of business, as opposed to a centralized model (such as Analytics Center
    of Excellence). What pros and cons do you see for such an organizational structure?**'

- en: '![decentralization-diagram](../Images/46d67e8526a27f758ae2f9714b3e55e0.png)**JB:**
    I think the pros of this approach are the ability to develop deep expertise in
    particular data types, whether it be external marketing feeds, server side impression
    data, search clicks, or playback logs. Each has its own nuances, and understanding
    these often becomes important in developing signals in our algorithms.'

- en: As with any sort of specialization, the potential downside is lack of exposure
    to alternative areas that might provide unexpected inspiration, but I think our
    regular in-company seminars, all-hands meetings, and cross-team initiatives are
    effective means of socializing such learning across verticals.

- en: '**AR: Q8\. Netflix has a lot of in-house developed software that are now open-source.
    Can you describe the motivations behind the development of Genie, Lipstick and
    Quinto?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**JB:** The motivation is one of scale and self-enablement through automation.
    In the case of Genie, abstracting the details of job submission from a particular
    cluster configuration allows us to flexibly scale the resources brokering job
    submissions behind the scenes as demand for computational resources changes, and
    also helps tie together the increasingly heterogeneous tasks we are running (Hive,
    Pig, Spark, Presto, etc.) with a common architecture.'

- en: In the case of Lipstick and Quinto, these tools make auditing and debugging
    ETL jobs much more ‘self-service’, whereas in the past we might have to dig through
    Pig log files or write adhoc data quality checks. Automated and user-friendly
    interfaces like these tools increase our productivity to tackle ever-harder problems
    in processing and understanding our data.
