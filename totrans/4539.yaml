- en: Avid users of R know that ggplot2 is there to make your life simpler when dealing
    with exploratory data analysis and data visualization. It makes it so easy to
    create elegant and powerful plots that can help decipher underlying relationships
    in the data.

- en: Python's plotting libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn does allow the user
    to create elegant graphics as well, but lack of a standardized syntax for implementing
    the grammar of graphics compared to the simple, readable and layering approach
    of ggplot2 in R makes it more difficult to implement in Python.

- en: The style I would say is 99% similar to ggplot2 in R. The major difference would
    be the use of parentheses as you will see in a few short examples below. One of
    the best takeaways of using plotnine is that the output is basically the same
    as you would get in R. There is visually no striking difference.

    We have many options for plotting subsets of our data with a single line of code
    as well.

- en: with simply adding **`facet_wrap(‘~gear’)`** to the end of the previous code
    we now have a faceted plot. *This is actually much simpler than using Matplotlib
    and Seaborn. Matplotlib will require you to create a separate chart for each set
    of variables you want to plot (for example, the above plot has 3 charts so you
    will have to create 3 charts) and Seaborn is simpler than Matplotlib but will
    require the use of a different commands that may confuse an inexperienced user.*

- en: By adding the `**size = ‘hp’**` we can obtain another insight from the data
    (the amount of horsepower) and `**theme_bw()**` to give a standardized format
    the plot with a nice simple theme. `theme_bw()` is that one theme command that
    any R user of ggplot2 will know. It is basically the defacto theme used before
    experimenting on other themes and formatting.

- en: As we go deeper we see that Plotnine gives us that simple API and stunning visuals
    we get from using ggplot2 in R. The ability to format plot with a single line
    of code is available in Seaborn but not in Matplotlib. Seaborn itself does have
    its similarities to Plotnine and ggplot2 in a way but the easily deciphered syntax
    is what gives it a unique selling point to make the switch.
