    work together for better data collection, categorization, analysis, and interpretation.
    However, we only ever hear of using AI to understand big data sets. This is because
    small data sets are usually easily understood by people, and applying AI to analyze
    and interpret them isn't necessary.

    line, slowly creating data scarcity. And unlike big companies, many setups cannot
    collect massive training sets due to risk, time, and budget limitations. This
    results in the neglect or incorrect application of AI solutions to small data
    sets.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The few-shot learning model introduces a small amount of training data to AI
    as a reference for new dataset interpretation. It is a commonly used approach
    in computer vision because it doesn't require many examples for identification.

    to be effective. So, instead of overloading the AI system with a lot of information,
    you input a [profit and loss statement template](https://www.freshbooks.com/accounting-templates/profit-and-loss)
    according to the system's capacity.

    will result in false results.

- en: When you upload sample data in the AI system, it learns the pattern from the
    training data set for future small data set interpretation. The appealing point
    of the few-shot learning model is that you don't need an extensive training data
    set to train the AI, making it operational at low cost and effort.

- en: The knowledge graphs model creates secondary data sets by filtering through
    a big original data set. It is used for storing interlinked descriptions and characteristics
    of events, objects, real situations, and theoretical or abstract concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to working as data storage, this model simultaneously encodes semantics
    underlying the specific data set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary function of the [knowledge graphs model](/2019/06/data-fabric-machine-learning-building-knowledge-graph.html)
    is the organization and structuring of important points from the data set to integrate
    information collected from various sources. A knowledge graph is labeled to associate
    specific meanings. There are two main components in a graph - nodes and edges.
    Nodes are two or more items, and edges represent the connection and relation between
    them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use knowledge graphs to store information, integrate data, and manipulate
    data through multiple algorithms to highlight new information. Moreover, they
    are handy for organizing small data sets to make them highly explainable and reusable.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies avoid applying AI on small data sets because they are uncertain about
    the results. The same methods that produce effective results for big data sets
    backfire and create false results. However, the [transfer learning method](https://builtin.com/data-science/transfer-learning)
    makes similar and reliable results despite the size of the data set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Transfer learning uses one AI model as a starting point but obtains the results
    with a new AI model. In short, it is the process of transferring knowledge from
    one model to another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This model is primarily used in the computer vision field and naturally processed
    languages. The reason is that these tasks require a lot of data and computing
    power. So, using transfer learning cuts down the extra time and effort.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new data set must be similar to the original training data set to apply
    the transfer learning model on small data. During application, remove the end
    of the neural network and add a fully connected layer similar to new data set
    classes. After this, randomize the weights of fully connected layers while freezing
    the previous network's weights. Now, update and train the AI network according
    to the new fully connected and operational layer.

    from the available or training data set. Then, it uses already available data
    to predict the unobserved or hidden data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SSL model is mainly used for performing regression analysis and classification
    tasks. However, it is also helpful for labeling unlabeled data in computer vision,
    video processing, and robot control fields. This model has rapidly solved the
    data labeling challenge as it independently builds and supervises the complete
    process. This way, companies save the additional cost and time spent creating
    and applying different AI models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the SSL model is highly adaptable as it creates reliable results despite
    the data set size, proving the model's scalability. SSL is also great for improving
    AI capabilities long term as it supports up-gradation. Moreover, it eliminates
    the need for sample cases as the AI system evolves independently.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is [artificially generated data](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/08/what-is-synthetic-data/)
    created by an AI algorithm that has been trained on a real data set. As the name
    suggests, it is artificially created and is not based on actual events. Synthetic
    data's result prediction prowess matches original data predictions. It can replace
    the initial data predictions because it does not use disguising and modification.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Synthetic data is ideal to use when there are gaps in the available data set,
    and it is impossible to fill them with the accumulated data. Moreover, it is inexpensive
    compared to other AI learning and testing models and does not compromise customer
    privacy. As a result, synthetic data is quickly taking over multiple fields, and
    by the end of 2024, [60% of AI analytic projects](https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2021/07/24/by-2024-60-of-the-data-used-for-the-development-of-ai-and-analytics-projects-will-be-synthetically-generated/)
    will be synthetically generated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Synthetic data is gaining more footing because companies can create it to meet
    specific conditions that are not available in the existing data. So, if companies
    cannot access a data set due to privacy limitations or a product is not available
    for testing, they can still obtain reliable results using AI algorithms to create
    synthetic data.

    most people do not know that they can apply AI algorithms. For example, it is
    good for organizing and analyzing big data while also being quite effective on
    smaller data sets. But to achieve the correct result, you must utilize accurate
    AI methods and models. Use the AI models listed in this article as they are suitable
    for creating correct results on small data sets.
