    the world around us.

- en: Also known as scaling laws, power laws essentially imply that a small number
    of occurrences of some phenomena are frequent, or very common, while a large number
    of of occurrences of the same phenomena are infrequent, or very rare; the exact
    relationship between these relative frequencies differ between power law distributions.
    Some of the wide array of naturally occurring and man made phenomena which power
    laws are able to describe include income disparities, word frequencies of a given
    language, city sizes, website sizes, magnitudes of earthquakes, book sales rankings,
    and surname popularity.

    give examples of what they describe, hopefully bringing them to the attention
    of new data science practitioners. Why? Well, the more ways we investigate, scrutinize,
    approach, and appreciate our data, the better the chances we are able to understand
    it, share it, and ultimately help others understand it.

- en: Zipf's Law, named after linguist [George Kinglsey Zipf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kingsley_Zipf),
    was originally intended to describe the relationship between word frequencies
    in document collections. Which it does quite remarkably. If a document collection's
    words are ordered by frequency, and *y* is used to describe the number of times
    that the *x*th word appears, Zipf's observation is concisely captured as *y =
    cx^(-1/2)* (item frequency is inversely proportional to item rank).

    states that it can be approximated that 80% of the effects of some particular
    phenomena are a result of 20% of the phenomena's causes. The actual power law
    associated with this principle is the [Pareto distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution),
    which describes, among other things, hard disk drive error rates, human settlement
    sizes, meteorite sizes, and oil reserve discoveries.

    of wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth), intimating that
    a majority (80%) of societal wealth is controlled by a minority (20%) of its members.
    The exact numbers may slide, but this principle is still applied and rigorously
    researched in economics today.

    describes author publication frequency in a given academic field. The law states
    that the number of authors making *x* academic contributions in a particular time
    period is a fraction of the number of authors making only one contribution; the
    observation is *1 / x^a*, where *a* is very close to 2 (but is academic discipline-specific).
    As a result, we can approximate that 1/4 the number of authors publish 2 papers
    as publish a single paper, 1/9 as many publish 3 papers, 1/16 publish 4 papers,
    and so on.

    is a manifestation of particular types of power laws. If you have read this far
    and still can''t figure out how power laws can be of practical use in data science
    (or even much more broadly), I suggest you investigate this particular concept
    further, which is not nearly as revolutionary as its "discovery" and popularization
    suggest, but does help frame and apply the conversation.'

- en: Many power laws exist. Furthermore, there are all sorts of other relationships
    between phenomena in the world. Investigating and understanding as many relationships
    as possible can be very insightful for data scientists looking to make sense of
    the data they are studying, and wanting to put it in terms others can understand.
    Beware the flip side, however; not all relationships can be approximated as such,
    and trying to force data into an artificial description can be misleading. Power
    laws (and descriptive relationships, in general) should be treated as another
    potential tool at your disposal.
