    amount of time accounting for missing records or aggregating data at a particular
    temporal granularity either via SQL queries or writing custom functions. Pandas
    has a very efficient [resample function ](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html)that
    can help you process the data at a particular frequency by simply setting the
    DataFrame index to be the timestamp column.

- en: I am going to use the room occupancy dataset to give an example of this function.
    You can find the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+).
    This dataset records observations at a minute level.

    which has missing records. It is important to account for those records since
    you might want to put in 0 values if there were no records or use the previous
    or next time steps for imputation. Below, I removed records for hour 15 to show
    how you can use the hour 14 timestamp to impute the missing value:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From analysis to model training to model reporting, visualizations are often
    required. Especially with time series graphs, I noticed I was spending a lot of
    time trying to customize the size and angle of my x-axis ticks in matplotlib.
    After I switched to using Plotly Express, I cut down the time I spent in making
    graphs looking cleaner/crisper by around 70%. And if I want to implement specific
    details in my visuals I can still do that by using Plotly Graph Objects. Additionally,
    Plotly offers a lot of easy options via Express like setting group colors in plots
    which results in more powerful visualizations.

    line plots with color grouping. We can see how easy it to create these plots with
    just two functions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I sometimes run into long wait times for processing pandas columns even with
    running code on a notebook with a large instance. Instead, there is an easy one
    word addition that can be used to speed up the apply functionality in a pandas
    DataFrame. One only has to import the library swifter.

    it via swifter apply() vs the vanilla apply(). I also created a dummy function
    with simple if else conditions to test the two approaches on.

- en: While we are on the topic of decreasing time complexity, I often end up dealing
    with datasets that I wish to process at multiple granularities. Using multiprocessing
    in python helps me save that time by utilizing multiple workers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I demonstrate the effectiveness of multiprocessing using the same 50 million
    rows data frame I created above. Except this time I add a categorical variable
    which is a random value selected out of a set of vowels.

    methods carefully since they will not serialize the output therefore using them
    via grouping can be a good means to leverage this capability.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the rise of using Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches for time
    series forecasting, it is essential to use a metric **NOT** just based on the
    distance between predicted and actual value. A metric for a forecasting model
    should use errors from the temporal trend as well to evaluate how well a model
    is performing instead of just point in time error estimates. Enter [Mean Absolute
    Scaled Error](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/another-look-at-measures-of-forecast-accuracy/)!
    This metric that takes into account the error we would get if we used a random
    walk approach where last timestamp’s value would be the forecast for the next
    timestamp. It compares the error from the model to the error from the naive forecast.

    the MASE is to 0, the better the forecasting model.
