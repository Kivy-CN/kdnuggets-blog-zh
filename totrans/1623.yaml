    one of the largest changes in Spark scheduling since the inception of the project,
    since the original 600 lines of code.

    amounts of constantly updated training data to build state-of-the-art models.
    AI has always been one of the most exciting applications of big data and Apache
    Spark. In part driven by deep learning, we see Increasingly more Spark users want
    to integrate Spark with distributed machine learning frameworks built for state-of-the-art
    training.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is, big data frameworks like Spark and distributed deep learning
    frameworks don’t play well together due to the disparity between how big data
    jobs are executed and how deep learning jobs are executed. As an example, on Spark,
    each job is divided into a number of individual tasks that are independent of
    each other. This is called "embarrassingly parallel," and this is a massively
    scalable way of doing data processing that can scale up to petabytes of data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, deep learning frameworks use different execution schemes. They assume
    complete coordination and dependency among the tasks. What that means is this
    pattern is optimized for constant communication, rather than large-scale data
    processing to scale to petabytes of data.

- en: Project Hydrogen introduces a new scheduling primitive for Spark - Gang Scheduling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this mode, the tasker schedules "all or nothing". Which means either all
    of the tasks are scheduled in one shot, or none of the tasks are scheduled at
    all. This actually reconciles the fundamental incompatibilities of how Spark works
    with the distributed ML frameworks needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now users can use a simple API to introduce a barrier function. The barrier
    function indicates to Spark whether it should be using the embarrassingly parallel
    or gang scheduler mode at each stage of the machine learning pipeline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the new gang scheduler mode can be used for model training using
    a distributed training framework, while embarrassingly parallel can be used before
    for data prep, as well as for model inference once the model has been trained.

    analytics and machine learning?**'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    learning frameworks as first-class citizens on Spark. It truly unifies data processing
    with machine learning and specifically distributed training on Spark.

- en: We want to make every other framework as easy to run as MLlib directly on Spark,
    whether it is TensorFlow or Horovod, or future popular ML frameworks. It significantly
    expands the ecosystem of ML frameworks that can be used effectively on Spark for
    deep learning applications.

    project soon.

- en: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has massive potential to drive disruptive innovations
    affecting most enterprises on the planet. However, most enterprises are struggling
    to succeed with AI​. Why is that? Simply put, AI and Data are siloed in different
    systems and different organizations.​
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apache Spark was the first unified analytics engine - It kind of sparked this
    revolution because it's the only engine out there that actually combined data
    processing and machine learning. With Project Hydrogen, we are expanding Spark’s
    built-in optimizations well beyond MLlib, so that developers can benefit from
    a unified approach to data processing and machine learning, using any ML framework
    on Spark.

    it comes to productionizing AI applications, such as sharing and tracking experiments
    and pushing models in production. That's why we just introduced [MLflow](https://dbricks.co/2M0rzGD),
    a new cross-cloud open source framework designed to simplify the end to end machine
    learning lifecycle.

- en: Very few companies have been successful at doing AI at scale and company wide.
    This is what we call the 1% problem. The majority of companies - the 99% - continue
    to struggle due to having disparate systems and technologies, and organizational
    divides between data engineering and data scientists. To achieve AI, organizations
    need to unify data and AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apache Spark was the first step to unify data and AI, but that alone is not
    enough - organizations still need to manage a lot of infrastructure. To eliminate
    obstacles for AI, companies have to leverage unified analytics. Unified Analytics
    brings together data processing with AI technologies, making AI much more achievable
    for enterprise organizations and enabling them to accelerate their AI initiatives.
    Unified Analytics makes it easier for enterprises to build data pipelines across
    various siloed data storage systems and to prepare labelled datasets for model
    building, which allows organizations to do AI on their existing data and iteratively
    do AI on massive data sets.

    and data engineers to work effectively across the entire development-to-production
    lifecycle. The organizations that succeed in unifying their domain data at scale
    **and** unifying that data with the best AI technologies will be the ones that
    succeed with AI.
