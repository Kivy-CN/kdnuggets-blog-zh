    Studio (DSS)**](http://www.dataiku.com/), a complete Data Science software tool
    for developers and analysts, significantly shortens the load-clean-train-test-deploy
    cycles that are time-consuming when building predictive applications. We, at Dataiku,
    have built this software by trying to capture what data scientist do on a day-to-day
    basis. We feel statistical software needs to adapt to the time of big data, where
    data integration and data pipelining capabilities are more important than ever.'

    (Hadoop, SQL, Cassandra, MongoDB, S3, …) and formats (CSV, Excel, SAS, JSON, Avro,
    …)  for data today. After connecting to a data source, the first step in any serious
    modeling job is cleaning the data. As you know, this process typically takes up
    as much as 80% of data scientists’ time. To speed this up, our studio comes with
    strong data integration capabilities. First, DSS automatically infers smart data
    types over data (such as Gender, Country, IP Address, URL, Date, …). Analysts
    can leverage these smart data types to validate and transform the data in an automated
    way (like getting the country out the IP, the day of week out of the date, and
    so on). They can also perform more mundane tasks such as replacement, grouping,
    splitting, calculating, and others on DSS’s interface which shows them an instant
    visual feedback of any operation.

    It automatically creates a tunable features engineering pipeline with missing
    value imputation, dummy variable encoding, impact coding, feature generation,
    and reduction.

    and H2O frameworks. Users can compare models, analyze their performance, and tune
    all the parameters from the web UI. Committed to a White Box approach, DSS lets
    advanced users generate the full Python source level code for the whole pipeline
    (in Python), so that they can modify it at will.

    enable retraining or scoring. These workflows include the full data flow from
    raw data to predictions. The workflow engine is incremental (for instance, it
    can work incrementally on hourly updated data) and robust (it can intelligently
    recover from situations were part of the data was temporarily available). These
    workflows can be extended with custom code in Python, R, SQL or Pig, enabling
    full Hadoop based workloads. Predicted values can be accessed through a REST API
    or published directly by DSS to a variety of destinations (e.g. ElasticSearch,
    FTP servers, internal Data warehouse).

    cycles without dumbing them down; it is a tool for qualified data scientists while
    remaining accessible for less technical business intelligence or marketing profiles.
