    [why you should care](https://svds.com/value-exploratory-data-analysis/). In that
    post, we covered at a very high level what exploratory data analysis (EDA) is,
    and the reasons both the data scientist and business stakeholder should find it
    critical to the success of their analytical projects. However, that post may have
    left you wondering: How do I do EDA myself?'

    a tutorial at [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2017/) titled [Exploratory Data Analysis
    in Python](https://us.pycon.org/2017/schedule/presentation/170/)—you can watch
    it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5WE9Db2RLU). In this post, we will
    summarize the objectives and contents of the tutorial, and then provide instructions
    for following along so you can begin developing your own EDA skills.

    every time you perform EDA (the main trunk of the tree) but at each step, observations
    will lead you down other avenues (branches) of exploration by raising questions
    you want to answer or hypotheses you want to test.'

    you. As such, the actual exploration you do while following along on this tutorial
    will be yours. We have no answers or set of conclusions we think you should come
    to about the datasets. Our goal is simply to aid in making your exploration as
    effective as possible, and to let you have the fun of choosing which branches
    to follow.

    works through an exploratory analysis of a dataset that comes from a [fascinating
    paper](https://osf.io/gvm2z/) published with commentary [in Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/crowdsourced-research-many-hands-make-tight-work-1.18508).
    The core question of the paper is reflected in the title, “Many analysts, one
    dataset: Making transparent how variations in analytical choices affect results”.
    The authors recruited around 30 analytic teams who were each tasked with the same
    research question: “Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark
    skin toned players than light skin toned players?” and given the same data. The
    dataset came from the players who played in the 2012–13 European football (soccer)
    professional leagues. Data about the players’ ages, heights, weights, position,
    skintone rating, and more were included. The results from the teams were then
    compared to see how the different ways of looking at the dataset yielded different
    statistical conclusions. The rich dataset provides ample opportunity to perform
    exploratory data analysis. From deciding hierarchical field positions, to quantiles
    in height or weight. We demonstrate several useful libraries including standard
    libraries like pandas, as well as lesser known libraries like `missingno`, `pandas-profiling`,
    and `pivottablejs`.'

    of the United Nation’s [AQUASTAT](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/index.html)
    dataset. This dataset provides metrics around water availability and water use,
    as well as other demographic data for each country, reported every five years
    since 1952\. This dataset is often called *panel* or *longitudinal data* because
    it is data that is repeatedly collected for the same subjects (in this case, countries)
    over time. We discuss methods for exploring it as panel data, as well as methods
    focused on looking at only a cross-section of the data (data collected for a single
    time period across the countries). The data also is geospatial, as each observation
    corresponds to a geolocated area. We show how to look at very basic data on maps
    in Python, but geospatial analysis is a deep field and we scratch only the surface
    of it while looking at this dataset. We recommend the [PySAL tutorial](http://darribas.org/gds_scipy16/)
    as an introduction to geospatial analysis in Python.'

    We went through a lot of material in the three hours of the tutorial (and had
    to deal with some of the technical troubles inevitable during a hands-on tutorial
    of 65+ people using computers with different operating systems and various company
    firewalls!). To get full value out of the content, we suggest you pause throughout
    the tutorial when there are suggestions to try certain analyses yourself.

    to look at the data in different ways and we welcome you to submit your own EDA
    notebooks for either or both of the datasets through a pull request in the github
    repo. We will provide feedback and approve PRs for your approaches to be shared
    with others developing their EDA skills.
