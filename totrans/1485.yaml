    to generate insights into a problem that needs to be solved. The *Harvard Business
    Review* said [Data Scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century).
    **How often has that article been referenced to convince people?**

    “Data Scientist”. Statisticians have used their knowledge and skills using machine
    learning techniques such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest for prediction
    and insights for decades. Those same statisticians were also likely very knowledgeable
    in Linear Algebra and Calculus. Statisticians were even responsible for one of
    the greatest gifts to Data Science — [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Ross Ihaka
    and Robert Gentleman are the two statisticians responsible for giving us the R
    language that gives us the ability to conduct complex analysis with a few lines
    of code. See this paper: [R: A Language for Data Analysis and Graphics by Ross
    Ihaka and Robert Gentleman](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/R-paper.pdf).'

    of data scientists over the next few years, universities are introducing new programs
    and potential students are racing to become the next cohort of data scientists
    that are going to fill that gap and get that [$100,000 pay packet with the №1
    job in America](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-most-sought-after-job-in-america-pays-110000-but-you-will-need-this-skill-2017-09-21)
    (that is not reality especially for beginners although there can be outliers).
    While a university education would be adequate in most of the cases, a lot of
    people are opting for MOOC’s to support their career path into Data Science. Coursera,
    edX, Data Camp and Data Quest are some of the most famous MOOC’s that people turn
    to and trust. The problem here is that the people taking these courses might not
    be qualified in the basics of statistics to at least understand what is being
    taught.

    based on years of hard work, learning and passion to do the job. The statisticians
    of past were not glamoured like “Data Scientists” are today. The profession is
    at risk of being cheapened to a job that someone could get started with by paying
    less than $100 online. I am all for more access to education and online learning
    but the profession should not be cheapened.

    type conversions, incorrect spelling duplicate rows, class imbalances etc. cannot
    all be handled exclusively with automated technology. According to media and current
    data scientists, data preprocessing takes up to 80% of a data scientist's job.
    While automation can help to a certain extent, the inference from Exploratory
    Data Analysis should be made by a person with industry knowledge or someone with
    an adequate grasp of statistics.

- en: Machine learning packages come with models that have default hyperparameters
    set for it to be trained and tested. One can simply change the arguments to tune
    the model. However, just changing arguments without exploring the result of the
    changes is a waste of time. Changing a hyperparameter could lead to a model being
    over-fitted, under-fitted, biased etc. Different models will have different ways
    of being explored as well. For example when tuning a decision tree, it would be
    best to plot the tree to see the results of tuning because by changing the complexity
    parameter, you may prune the tree to an extent that you underfit/overfit your
    model.

    but actually something that needs to be accommodated/accounted for in the modelling
    and evaluation stage. Either they need to resample the data or change the threshold
    probability to predict each class (i.e. decrease the threshold probability to
    predict the minor class).

    not see transitioning into a doctor, engineer or lawyer so willfully. The profession
    of data science should not be diluted to a point where we say anyone can be a
    data scientist. Everyone should have the opportunity to join any profession of
    their choice but to say anyone can do it just dilutes the profession into something
    that would not require the amount of work an undergraduate, post graduate or doctoral
    candidate would put into becoming a Data Scientist.
