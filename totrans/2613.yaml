    test and others are all **verification **steps where tasks are oriented to verify
    specifics. Software output is verified against desired output. On the other hand,
    model inspection, black box testing, usability testing are all **validation **steps
    where tasks are oriented to understand if software meets the requirements and
    expectations.

- en: ​​​​​​​The role of **data verification **in machine learning pipeline is that
    of a gatekeeper. It **ensures accurate and updated data** over time. Data verification
    is made primarily at the new data acquisition stage i.e. at step 8 of the ML pipeline,
    as shown in Fig. 2\. Examples of this step are to identify duplicate records and
    perform deduplication, and to clean mismatch in customer information in field
    like address or phone number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, **data validation **(atstep 3 of the ML pipeline)ensures
    that the incremental data from step 8 that is added to the learning data is of
    good quality and similar (from statistical properties perspective) to the existing
    training data. For example, this includes **finding data anomalies** or detecting **differences
    between existing training data and new data **to be added to the training data.
    Otherwise, any data quality issue/statistical differences in incremental data
    may be missed and training **errors may accumulate over time **and **deteriorate
    model accuracy**. ​​​​​​​Thus, data validation detects **significant changes (if
    any) in incremental training data **at an early stage that helps with root cause
    analysis. ​​​​​​​
