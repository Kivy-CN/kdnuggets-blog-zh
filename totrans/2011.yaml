    to fuel their growth, strategic investments, and customer engagement. Big data
    is the underlying constant in the targeted advertisement, personalized marketing,
    product recommendations, insights generation, price optimizations, sentiment analysis,
    predictive analytics, and much more.

    of work and creates 'Workunits.' These 'Workunits' are then picked up for execution
    as 'Tasks,' which include extraction, conversion, quality checking, and writing
    of data to the destination. The final step, 'Data Publish,' validates the successful
    execution of the pipeline and atomically commits the output data, if the destination
    supports it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a significant scale with multiple data pipelines and high volume, data needs
    to be processed in batches and over time. Therefore, it necessitates checkpointing
    so the data pipelines can resume from where they left off last time and continue
    onwards. Apache Gobblin supports low and high watermarks and supports robust state
    management semantics via State Store on HDFS, AWS S3, MySQL and more transparently.

- en: Most data pipelines today have to be written twice, once for batch data and
    again for near-line or streaming data. It doubles the effort and introduces inconsistencies
    in policies and algorithms applied to different types of pipelines. Apache Gobblin
    solves this by allowing users to author a pipeline once and run it on both batch
    and stream data if used in Gobblin Cluster mode, Gobblin on AWS mode, or Gobblin
    on Yarn mode.

    nodes, or the cloud - Apache Gobblin can be deployed and used on-prem and on the
    cloud. Therefore, allowing users to write their data pipelines once and migrate
    them along with Gobblin deployments easily between on-prem and cloud, based on
