- en: Foundation models, like GPT-4, work by pre-training a massive neural network
    on a large corpus of data and then fine-tuning the model on specific tasks, enabling
    them to perform a wide range of language tasks with minimal task-specific training
    data.

    journey by learning from vast amounts of unsupervised data, such as text from
    the internet or large collections of images. This pre-training phase enables the
    models to grasp the underlying structures, patterns, and relationships within
    the data, helping them form a strong knowledge base.'

    which refers to their ability to apply knowledge gained from one task to new,
    related tasks. Some models even demonstrate zero-shot learning capabilities, meaning
    they can tackle tasks without any fine-tuning, relying solely on the knowledge
    acquired during pre-training.
