- en: Over the past few weeks, we’ve been taking in a lot of heft news about ChatGPT,
    GPT-4, etc. Some of you have probably seen something around AutoGPT, but naturally
    and I don’t blame you; you probably thought it was just another GPT-Plugin or
    Chrome-Extension. But AutoGPT is more than that.

    via API, allowing projects to be created that have been iterating on their own
    prompts and reviewing each iteration to improve and build upon it. How does this
    work exactly?'

- en: So what’s so good about AutoGPT? Well first thing first, it is important to
    note that GPT has the ability to write its own code using GPT-4\. It also executes
    Python scripts which allow it to recursively debug, develop, build and continuously
    self-improve. Crazy right? AutoGPT is a self-improving AI - showing true AGI (Artificial
    General Intelligence) capabilities.

    looking back and reviewing its own prompts - just to ensure the project is what
    the user wants. You give it a goal, it scrapes the web for the best information
    out there, and then it autonomously does the task for you and continues to constantly
    improve itself.

    of AutoGPT creating an app for Varun Mayya, a Computer Science Engineer. AutoGPT
    recognized that Varun did not have a Node, so it googled how to install Node,
    where AutoGPT then found a Stackoverflow article with a link, downloaded it, extracted
    it, and then spawned the server on Varun's behalf.

    you will need to do a lot of testing. This allows you to test and cater your AI
    project to how you want it before it costs you anything.
