    to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/big-data/what-is-big-data/), big data is data
    that “contains greater variety, arriving in increasing volumes, and with more
    velocity.” With the advent of big data, we now have giant, complex data sets that
    can provide insights to more business problems than ever before. Data science
    companies have been cropping up in every industry to analyze this data for business
    insights.

    Although few universities have data science programs, the industry is growing

    and almost every significant company out there will have a few data scientists
    working for them. Bernhardt Schroeder reports in[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernhardschroeder/2021/06/11/the-data-analytics-profession-and-employment-is-exploding-three-trends-that-matter/?sh=5fea28f33f81) that
    according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the data science industry in
    the U.S. will grow by 28% by 2026\. There are tons of open positions in data science,

    they have one project called [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth),
    which puts their Cloud and AI tools in the hands of people working to improve

    how to become a data scientist at Amazon](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/amazon-data-scientist-position-guide/).)
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest individual market share holder in the

    that employs data scientists in order to provide machine learning and data science
    solutions along with their AWS cloud services.

    has made great use of data scientists. Their previous head of data science stated
    that Airbnb “looks at data as the voice of the customer, and data science as the
    interpretation of that voice.” I find customer-centric companies great to work
    for. There’s a purpose and logic to the decisions that are made, and they are
    meant to benefit both the customer and the business.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    their hiring practices. They’ve used data science to analyze and drive out bias
    in their own hiring behavior. Data science companies have the option to use a
    lot of their knowledge on internal processes, and Airbnb is a great example of
    this. Their culture of self-reflection and critique is why I think Airbnb is one
    of the best data science companies to work for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    science positions in finance, trust, and guest experiences. With such a wide array
    of focus areas, a data scientist could move around within Airbnb and gain exposure
    to a lot of different industries. I always think it’s a good idea to plan ahead
    and think about your next three moves. Working at Airbnb as a data scientist could
    lead to work with a fintech company, security, or a more customer-facing role,
    so if that’s something you’re interested in, check out Airbnbs list of open data
