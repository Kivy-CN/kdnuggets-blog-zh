- en: As a computation platform for study and practice, especially for machine learning
    and data science, Google Colab is tough to beat. The no setup required, easy to
    use, stable notebook environment — when paired with its seamless cloud access
    from multiple devices — is a fair trade-off for some understood reduction in speed,
    reliability, and configurability in many non-critical circumstances. For me, the
    worry free portable shared access between my notebook, workstation, and Chromebook
    was key for study and testing, and Colab fills this void extraordinarily well
    and extraordinarily easily.

    Colab adventures.

- en: '**1\. Use a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) runtime**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You already know that you can use a GPU runtime for free with Colab. But did
    you know you can also use [Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/)?
  prefs: []

- en: What is a TPU?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud TPU is the custom-designed machine learning ASIC that powers Google products
    like Translate, Photos, Search, Assistant, and Gmail.

    GPU → TPU. Designed by Google, these ASICs are meant for one purpose and [one
    purpose only](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tpus):'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud TPU resources accelerate the performance of linear algebra computation,
    which is used heavily in machine learning applications. TPUs minimize the time-to-accuracy
    when you train large, complex neural network models. Models that previously took
    weeks to train on other hardware platforms can converge in hours on TPUs.

- en: To test out a TPU, and see how they may affect the execution speeds of your
    tensor-processing code, select **Runtime** → **Change Runtime Type**, and then
    select **TPU** from the **Accelerator type** drop down menu. You will have to
    restart the notebook's runtime environment once you do so, but selecting "Yes"
    from an immediate prompt will take care of it for you.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use inline code to [upload files to](/2018/02/essential-google-colaboratory-tips-tricks.html)
    and [download files from](/2019/01/more-google-colab-environment-management-tips.html)
    your local drive to and from Colab. However, the file explorer GUI on the left
    side of the Colab editor can be used to do the same using point and click. You
    can use this same menu for mounting your Google Drive to seamlessly access all
    of the files within.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the options of **Upload** and **Mount Drive** can both be seen.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to open an existing Colab notebook within Colab, no explanation
    is necessary. But what if you want to open a Jupyter notebook that resides on
    your computer or lives elsewhere on the interwebs? Well, that's also easy, actually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Clicking **File** → **Open Notebook** opens the same notebook selection window
    presented upon starting up Colab. However, if you don''t usually pay much attention
    to the ribbon along the top you might miss the options for opening a notebook
    from a GitHub repo or uploading from your local drive. Here''s what the **GitHub**
    tab looks like:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do you have data files, trained parameter weights, custom libraries, or other
    files you want to use, but don't want the hassle of manually uploading them to
    Colab? Would you prefer to work with the files locally?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google Drive sync can help here. The process is different for each operating
    system, but the basic idea is to [set up syncing between your Google Drive account
    and your local computer](https://www.google.com/drive/download/), select which
    local folders you want to synchronize with Google Drive, and then work directly
    in those folders on your computer and they will immediately be synchronized to
    Google Drive upon making changes to files within.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a handy trick that comes to us by way of [Rohit Midha](https://rohitmidha23.github.io/Colab-Tricks/).
    This isn't so much a Colab or machine learning or data science tip, but it can
    be useful for us nonetheless.
  prefs: []

- en: If you have a lengthy training job running on Colab, why bother monitoring it
    when you can simply send yourself an email when it's finished? This code, credit
    again to [Rohit Midha](https://rohitmidha23.github.io/Colab-Tricks/), can be placed
    after your training loop, and can send you a message once training has completed.
    You can likely envision some more creative ways to configure what types of emails
    are sent for failed tasks, completed tasks, etc, or checkpoint emails for different
    points along your machine learning pipeline, perhaps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The code snippet uses the `smtplib` library which is included by default in
    your Colab environment. Just fill in the email addresses and passwords (use the
    same for both in order to send a message to yourself, for example) as well as
    the message and away you go.
  prefs: []

    "receiver_gmail_here@gmail.com", msg)  server.quit() [PRE1]`'
