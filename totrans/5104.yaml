    you’ll query super large database tables—with several thousands or even millions
    of rows—on a typical day at work. Which is why the performance of SQL queries
    becomes a significant factor in deciding the overall performance of the application.

    working with. But if you’d like to use a sample database table to run these queries,
    you can use [this Python script](https://github.com/balapriyac/python-basics/blob/main/sql-tips/main.py).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s quite common for beginners to use **SELECT *** to retrieve all columns
    from the table. This can be inefficient if you only need a few columns—which is
    almost always the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using **SELECT *** can, therefore, lead to excessive data processing, especially
    if the table has many columns or if you're working with a large dataset.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**SELECT DISTINCT** can be costly because it requires sorting and filtering
    the results to remove duplicates. It''s better to ensure that the data being queried
    is unique by design—using primary keys or unique constraints.'

    about indexes later). So when writing queries, ensure you understand your data—the
    different fields—at the data model level.

- en: 3\. Limit Query Results
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often you’ll query large tables with thousands of rows, but you don’t always
    need to (and cannot) process all the rows. Using the **LIMIT** clause (or its
    equivalent) helps to reduce the number of rows returned, which can speed up query
    performance.

- en: '[PRE4]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Using a LIMIT clause reduces the result set size, decreasing the amount of data
    to process and transfer. This is also useful for paginating results in applications.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indexes can significantly improve query performance by allowing the database
    to find rows faster than scanning the entire table. They are particularly useful
    for columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: You can now run queries that involve filtering on the ‘department’ column and
    compare the execution times. You should be able to see the results are much faster
    with the index. To learn more about creating indexes and performance improvements,
    use [How To Speed Up SQL Queries Using Indexes [Python Edition]](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/08/speed-sql-queries-indexes-python-edition.html).

- en: As mentioned, indexing improves the efficiency of queries that filter on indexed
    columns. But creating too many indexes can become too much of a good thing. Which
    leads us to the next tip!

- en: 5\. Use Indexes with Caution
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While indexes improve read performance, they can degrade write performance—INSERT,
    UPDATE,  and DELETE queries—because the index must be updated each time the table
    is modified. It's important to balance the number and types of indexes based on
    the type of queries you run often.

    queried but rarely updated. This ensures that the benefits of indexes outweigh
    their maintenance costs.

- en: Optimizing SQL queries involves understanding the specific needs of your queries
    and the structure of your data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By avoiding SELECT *, being careful with using SELECT DISTINCT, limiting query
    results, creating appropriate indexes, and being mindful of the trade-offs with
    indexing, you can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of your
    database operations.
