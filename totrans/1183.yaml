    of the amount of time it takes to become an expert in programming. If you have
    not read this article: *“[Teach Yourself Programming in 10 Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)”
    by Peter Norvig*, I encourage you to do so.

- en: The point here is that you don’t need 10 years to learn the basics of data science,
    but learning data science in a rush is certainly not helpful. It takes time, effort,
    energy, patience, and commitment to become a data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Beware of articles, books, or websites that tell you that you can learn data science

    (through self-study), and I continue to challenge myself to learn new things every
    day. How long it is going to take you to master the fundamentals of data science
    would depend on your background. Generally, a solid background in an analytical
    discipline such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, or
    economics is advantageous.

    in advanced mathematics, statistics, programming, and other related skills in
    data analysis, data visualization, model building, machine learning, etc. It took
    me 2 years of dedicated studies to master the fundamentals of data science, and
    that is because of my solid background in mathematics, physics, and programming.
    Here are some resources that helped me master the fundamentals of data science.

    and the government are producing tons upon tons of data on a daily basis. The
    demand for high-skilled data scientists will only continue to grow. This is the
    right time to invest your time to master the fundamentals of data science. In
    doing so, beware of articles, books, or websites that tell you that you can learn
    data science in 4 weeks or in a month. Do not be in a rush. Take your time to
    master the fundamentals of data science.
