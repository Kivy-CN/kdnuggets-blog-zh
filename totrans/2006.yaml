    other variables that can be analyzed to help businesses make informed decisions.
    For example, it can be used to measure performance or acquire validations.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ETL stands for **EXTRACT**, **TRANSFORM** and **LOAD**. It is the process of
    moving data from multiple sources to a centralized single database. It starts
    with the raw data being *EXTRACTED* from the source, and then *TRANSFORMED* on
    a separate processing server, in which it is then *LOADED* into the target database.

- en: 1\. Create a Roadmap for Your ETL Processes
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With anything you do in life, it is better to start with a plan rather than
    diving into the deep end. You may want to write it down or you make want to create
    a visualisation of your process. But the roadmap is essential as it allows you
    to go back and make adjustments and learn via trial and error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Populate Test Data Early
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you create your roadmap, you will be considering the end goal in mind. In
    your ETL process, you want to understand ‘what data model do you want to populate?’.
    Populating your data warehouse with sample data that is related to your end goal
    will make your process more effective. It helps you to keep in line with the task
    at hand and create rules.

- en: 3\. Review Source Data and Systems
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The source system contains the data that is fed to the data warehouse. You can
    use profiling tools to help you identify NULL values or what the columns serve
    as. Rather than spending your time on profiling queries, reviewing your source
    system can improve your ETL process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to identify primary key definitions in every source table, and any
    possible information/data related to it. Use this practice as a verification stage
    of feeling confident about what you are feeding into your data warehouse.

- en: 4\. Data Type Issues
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When querying your data, you don’t want to be coming across various errors due
    to data type issues. It’s a problem that should be addressed early on in the process
    so that it doesn’t cause problems later on.

- en: 5\. Extracting the Data

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Extracting the data from source systems is an important phase, which can cause
    many problems if not done correctly. Here are a few tips:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having a timestamp column in your source system will allow you to rely on that
    transaction date and ensure that all the necessary data has been extracted.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Extracting the data in incremental steps will help when you’re working with
    a very large source table.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take note of how long your extract processes take, as there may be ways you
    can improve it.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All your extracting data processes should be thoroughly reviewed and verified.

- en: 6\. Collating All Activity in ETL Logs
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best practise, not only with data warehouses but in life is logging
    everything. It’s better to go back to a whiteboard that had different ideas and
    processes scribbled everywhere, than a blank one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Through ETL logs, you can find valuable information such as extraction time,
    changes in rows, errors and more.

- en: 7\. Alerts
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can be overwhelming to watch an ETL process occur. You want to keep an eye
    on it, but sometimes it can take longer than you think and you might catch yourself
    up at ungodly hours. Some companies have created a messaging and alert procedure,
    which notifies them of any fatal errors that they need to be aware of.

    working with data warehouses and ETL. It will surprise you how these are the main
    challenges that a lot of companies/teams face.
