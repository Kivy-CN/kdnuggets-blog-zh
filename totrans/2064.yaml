    sun, so do the challenges of building a team capable of building sucessful AI
    projects. The demand for that archetypical “Data Scientist” who is the perfect
    blend of a statistician, programmer and communicator has never been greater. But
    as the dust settles, we have started hearing stories of [failed ](http://analytics-magazine.org/the-data-economy-why-do-so-many-analytics-projects-fail/)projects
    and [disenchanted](https://www.techinasia.com/talk/many-data-scientists-leaving) professionals.

    time. As a data science consultant who has worked in various industries, I’ve
    had the chance to see this trend firsthand. Many people tend think Data Science
    as a new field, and expect it to have growing pains as it becomes mainstream,
    but we forget where this field came from. This is my attempt to reflect on the
    qualities that make a successful data team though my own experiences and help
    business leaders and executives create better AI strategies.

    disciplines rather than an entirely new one. After all, we’ve been working with
    data before the computer age began, and the concept of AI has been around since
    at least the 1960s. Other disciplines like Knowledge Discovery from Databases,
    Decision Support Systems, Business Intelligence, Data Mining, Analytics, Predictive
    Analytics etc. have been around for a long time. The main goal of each of them
    is to extract meaningful patterns from data and use that to gain insights and
    make decisions for the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Science is the latest incarnation of this trend that was enabled by massive
    increase in the amount and variety data available to us in the internet age. It
    is further fueled by the availability of relatively cheap computational power
    and new breakthroughs in machine-learning algorithms that can make use of this
    abundant data. The increased complexity and mathematical sophistication of these
    new algorithms then created a sudden need for people with advanced degrees who
    could comprehend them and thus the AI race had begun.

    there is much we can learn from mythologies and best practices followed in older
    disciplines.

    It is an industrial process for structuring your analytics projects that has been
    around since the 1990s.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    phases. These are — **Business understanding**, **Data understanding**, **Data
    preparation**, **Modeling**, **Evaluation**, and **Deployment**.

    up with having the latest and greatest algorithms and computing processors, while
    taking the **data** for granted. We may have plenty of data available, but the
    quality of that data isn’t a given. Good data is still hard to collect, and hence
    can be the main competitive advantage you could have. The best algorithm cannot
    guarantee good models unless you feed it good data. As they say — Garbage in,
    Garbage out.

    free via open source software or through cloud providers at a very low cost. In
    a way AI algorithms have become or will be commoditized through these libraries
    and services.

    that everyone agrees on and are achievable in single-digit number of weeks. Also
    make sure that the data is obtainable, ROI and/or deliverables are clearly defined
    and the data team is following an iterative execution process.

    composition.

    what a Data Scientist is or does. Given the prestige associated with that job
    title, anyone whose job has ever been to work with some data seems to have that
    it in their CVs. I think it’s time to move on from that and have specialized titles
    based on what people actually do.
  prefs: []

- en: Just like we don’t expect a doctor to know every medical procedure or diagnosis,
    we shouldn’t expect someone to master everything in the AI either. We must have
    specialists who know the boundaries of their skillsets and responsibilities and
    can work with others to get the job done. Of course this doesn’t mean there aren’t
    people who excel at multiple areas or are generalists, just like we have GPs in
    medicine. Data science is for the most part a team sport.

- en: Since, data is the most essential ingredient of any data science strategy the
    first people you need are **Data Engineers**. A data engineer is generally someone
    with good programming and hardware skills, and who can be build your data infrastructure.
    It depends on the size of your data but they are generally comfortable working
    with big data and cloud technologies, know how to build data pipelines, design
    databases, and pull data out of them. They will know how to do look at the data
    at a basic level, and do simple aggregations for sanity checks on the data quality,
    but are not necessarily experts in analyzing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you’ve built out your data infrastructure and you will need people who
    can take that data, clean it, analyze it, run experiments on it and communicate
    the results. Depending on your business requirements the exact skills varies.
    Most of the time this work is done by **Data Analysts** who are skilled in the
    processing and cleaning data, creating statistical inference or predictive models,
    running experiments, plotting those results, creating reports and providing insights
    to stakeholders higher up. They’ll mostly be working in Jupyter notebook or Rstudio,
    and have a combination of programming, statistics and machine learning knowledge.
    We shouldn’t expect them to write production quality code though.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That brings me to the next role. If you are building a data product you will
    need **Machine Learning Engineers **in your team. These are not researchers who
    build machine learning algorithms per se but are data-focused software developers
    familiar with various data science libraries and know how to write production
    quality code based on the models developed by the analysts. To do this job they
    must work closely with Data Engineers, or it might be also done by a math savvy
    Data Engineer for smaller teams. Most developers looking to enter the data science
    field should consider this as a good career option.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes it might also be useful to have a more design-focused **Data Visualization
    Specialist** to create highly polished charts and reports to communicate the results
    of the analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I tend to think of a **Data Scientist** as someone who is above average in all
    of the aforementioned roles, and also who knows how to work with the **Domain
    Experts** to deliver results. These are collaborators generally outside your team
    or organization that you bring in to leverage their subject-matter expertise in
    cases such as medicine, finance, economics, marketing, law etc.

- en: If you are working on problems that require some custom or proprietary data
    science algorithms, it might then be time to hire someone with a PhD or core research
    background. They’ll probably have a deep understanding of the theory and algorithms
    behind an AI field like Conversational AI, Computer Vision, Robotics, Reinforcement
    Learning, Graphical Models etc. I tend to like the title **Research Engineer **or **Research
    Scientist** for a role like this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important but less talked about role in a data science team is that
    of a **Data Science Manager** or **Head of Data Science**. For smaller teams it
    might be sufficient to have a senior member of the team who has a good knowledge
    of all the different roles lead the team. But once the team grows you will probably
    need someone with a strong technological and business strategy background.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Science managers are hands-on leaders who will build the foundation of
    your data science strategy, recruit and build your team, make sure everybody interacts
    with each other, have the data and information that they need, and develop the
    process that the whole team can follow. They are the data team’s interface to
    the rest of the organization, collaborators and executives. They translate the
    complex AI jargon to non-experts, and make sure their work is aligned with the
    strategy of the organization as a whole.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important role that managers need to play that is often forgotten is
    devising a [**Data Governance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance)** and **[**Ethics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data_ethics)standard
    across the team. Most professionals coming in the field are taught the technical
    skills necessary to do their jobs, but rarely have I seen the importance of data
    privacy and ethical communication of analysis results being talked about. That
    results in cases like the [Facebook scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) which
    bring our field in disrepute. Having someone who knows and enforces these values
    in the team is in my opinion what will make you rise above the rest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, these are my views on makes a successful data science team. The main takeways
    are — if we keep our strategy simple to begin with, hire the right people at the
    right time, leverage the knowledge gathered from previous incarnations of the
    field, and develop a process that works best for your team and goals, there is
    no reason you cannot become an effective data-driven organization.
