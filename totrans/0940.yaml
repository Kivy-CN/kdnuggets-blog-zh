    data scientists, data analysts, business analysts, and many more. There is no
    doubt that data scientists are the most popular job profile in the field, which
    is why there is so much confusion around it, especially among beginners. When
    they try to explore this job profile, they get confused because of the random
    content available on the Internet that is very confusing, they are unable to decide
    whether this field is a good fit for them, and they are unable to decide the resources
    and why this is happening because of random postings and random myths across the
    globe for the data science profile and that is why we will be busting those top
    10 myths related to data science and will help you to debunk them.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists are all doing the same thing,
    which is completely wrong because their jobs, roles, and responsibilities are
    all very different. We understand this creates confusion because all of these
    people work under the same big data umbrella. First, let’s see what data engineers
    do. Their responsibility is to work on the basic engineering stuff and build those
    scalable data pipelines so that raw data can be extracted from multiple sources,
    transformed, and dumped into downstream systems. Data scientists and data analysts
    rely on this process because they transform data into something that matters —
    the process of transforming data into information. That is the key to representing
    meaningful insight in data and constructing accurate machine-learning models for
    data scientists. While these people should appear to be doing the same thing,
    their skills may overlap, but their duties are fundamentally distinct, which is
    why companies recruit people for different job profiles. If not, they would have
    hired a data specialist who does it all.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is also completely wrong, however, it also depends a lot on the type of
    job role you want to get. If we are looking for a role in research, for example,
    we need a master’s or Ph.D., but if you want to solve complex data problems and
    work around deep learning or machine learning, then you will be the one to work
    on the data science stuff using the libraries and using the data analysis approaches
    in order to create those complex data mysteries. Therefore, you don’t need to
    hold a Master’s Degree. Nowadays everything is all about skills so if you have
    the right skill set for the data scientist then you can definitely get into it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is also completely wrong because as a data scientist your job is to work
    on data extensively and when we talk about pro coding it means working too much
    on the competitive programming side or having a very in-depth knowledge of typical
    data structures and algorithms. Surely a data scientist must have good complex
    problem-solving skills and in the world of data science, we have languages ??like
    Python and R which provide very important support through multiple libraries that
    can be used to solve complex data problems. Your goal as a data scientist should
    be to understand how to use those libraries and their modules so that you can
    create the best data models and models related to machine learning. The data scientist
    must have these skills in order not to waste too much time on competitive programming
    or practicing typical data structures and algorithms.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the most important myths that must be debunked. Although more
    and more young people decide to study science subjects, mainly attracted by the
    growing offer of jobs in the technological field, to date the majority of people
    do not have a technical background. Companies tend to hire candidates for the
    data science profile, and those with non-tech and non-technical backgrounds are
    selected because they are really good at problem-solving and understanding business
    use cases. These are the important things to understand in order to be successful
    in data science interviews. Companies do not focus on the typical technical skills
    of a programmer, but they want to understand if the candidates are good in the
    aptitude part, if they are able to understand the case studies, if they are able
    to understand what kind of business matrices they can extract from the data and
    what kinds of complex data-related problems they can solve. So never think that
    coming from a non-CS or non-tech background you cannot enter the data science
    profile. By the way for CS graduates, their first priority is still software engineering
    and they want to make that career out of their career. That is why in this domain
    of data science, there are more and more job opportunities for non-tech people.
    So nowadays it doesn’t matter if you have a specific degree related to CS, you
    will still have the chance to work as a data scientist if you can acquire the
    right skills for the data science profile.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not everyone knows that data scientists invest 80% of their time in cleaning
    and transforming data and 20% of their time is dedicated to the data modeling
    part, so a data scientist who wants to create very accurate data as well as a
    machine learning model, he needs to clean and transformed data. We know that when
    we work on a particular Big Data solution, there are multiple steps involved in
    it and the first and very important part is transforming the data. Nowadays, we
    receive data from multiple sources, and the raw data sometimes contains errors,
    as well as junk records. If we cannot clean our data, we will not be able to obtain
    meaningful transformation data, and we will not be able to create machine learning
    models that are very accurate. That’s why data science is not just about building
    the predictive model and regression models, it’s a good mix of cleaning and transforming
    the data, and then building accurate machine learning models.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is also completely not true because being good at math is one of the important
    parts of your day-to-day activities as a data scientist. While analyzing the data
    we would need those mathematical concepts, let’s say aggregating the data statistics
    part, probability part, but that is something which is and not a must to have
    a skill set to become a data scientist. As we know in data science, we have amazing
    programming languages like Python and R which provides great support for amazing
    libraries as well which we can directly use in order to perform that typical mathematical
    calculation and computation so unless you need to innovate something, or you need
    to create any new algorithm you don’t need to be a mathematics expert.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good data science profile is a combination of multiple skills, technical skills
    plus non-technical skills. Both are required to become good data scientists. In
    order to become a good data scientist, you cannot just rely on programming or
    any specific tool you think is being used in data science. If you are a good expert
    in both stuff, you are likely to become a good data scientist. As data scientists,
    we have to interact with multiple stakeholders when working on complex data problems,
    and we must work directly with the business to gather all the requirements. Understanding
    the data domain, why we are processing it, what insights we can gain from the
    transform data, how to solve it, and what is relevant and what is irrelevant,
    are all necessary for this data science domain. Don’t think that only technical
    stuff or any specific tool like a language or a database is just enough to crack
    the data science profile. You need to use your non-technical skills and soft skills
    as your support system to become a good data scientist.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is a common question. If we would have discussed this topic five-six
    years back, then this was completely true. Companies were not focusing on the
    freshers for the data science role, but now in 2022, this has changed a lot because
    freshers nowadays are self-aware and self-motivated, and they are very interested
    in exploring fields such as data science, and data engineering. Instead of depending
    on others, they are putting their own effort into exploring these positions. They
    are also taking participation actively in competitions in hackathons open source
    contributions and trying to build cool projects on their own. That’s how they
    are able to acquire the right skill sets for the data science profile and also
    amazing dev skills. That’s why now companies are preferring freshers to join them
    to cope with the vacancies in data science roles.

    Job Profile
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you come from a data-related background, let’s say you worked as a data engineer,
    data analyst, or business analyst then this transition will be easy for you because
    you already know about the data and how to work with it different tools and tech
    frameworks. On the other hand, if you are coming from a different job profile
    as a testing profile or a software engineering profile then transitioning into
    data science will be challenging but not impossible. You need to work on a skill
    set you need to acquire and then work on some realistic projects that can help
    you in acquire new capabilities and develop your interest in the data science
    domain to understand how you really can add value to the company as a data scientist.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science competitions are a good idea to acquire the right skills and also
    to get an idea of the data science environment and even acquire development skills,
    but if you think that by only participating in hackathons, and creating projects
    in competitions, you can help you become a data science expert then this is not
    true. You will improve and add value to your resume, so that you can showcase
    your work and what kind of results you have achieved, but if you really want to
    be an expert you need to work on some realistic use cases or a production-level
    application. For this reason, it is advisable that freshmen are directed toward
    a good internship.
