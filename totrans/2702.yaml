    Kaggle reached 5 million users. Further, not all competitions are open to everyone
    in the world. Here’s the policy of one competition, for instance:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*“Members of the Kaggle community who are not United States Citizens or legal
    permanent residents at the time of entry are allowed to participate in the Competition
    but **are not eligible to win prizes**. If a team has one or more members who
    are not prize eligible, then the entire team is not prize eligible.”*'

    pond,” as there are a lot fewer competitors.

    the industry, as you’ll need knowledge in statistics, computing, communication,

    you can share with the world. Ideally, your projects can resonate with non-technical
    audiences as well, such as hiring managers who often don’t understand the intricacies
    of the field. To do so, you can use no-code analytics tools like [Apteo](http://apteo.co/) that
    let you share very simple and easy-to-understand analyses.
