- en: That's a broad topic which has been treated many times. Much of what has been
    written on this topic is good, much is bad. But I find that the stats vs. machine
    learning argument, at that level, tends to focus on the forest at the cost of
    completely overlooking the trees.

    to focus on different ends of the respective spectrums of each of these concepts,
    treating machine learning as a *practical activity* and statistics as a *theoretical
    abstraction* (and, yes, I'm lumping "statistical modeling" together with "statistics"
    in this case... at least, for now). The relationship between statistics and machine
    learning is actually a highly complex one, and merely defining the 2 concepts
    is not helpful in dissecting this connection.

    and, ultimately, a waste of time. Even if you are interested in exploring such
    a topic, looking at more specific questions can likely bear more fruit, and possibly
    (hopefully?) lead to more concrete conclusions. Also, a more accurate framing
    is that of statistical versus machine learning **models**.

    CSci -- CEO and CAO, Statoo Consulting, Switzerland & Professor of Data Science,
    University of Geneva, Switzerland -- his thoughts, and he was kind enough to provide
    the following insight:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every supervised analytics model (from statistics, data science and/or machine
    learning) makes assumptions concerning how the distribution of the output (or
    some aspect of it) depends on the model inputs. If no assumptions whatsoever would
    be made, there is no rational basis to generalise beyond the data observed.

    the assumptions were verified). In other words, any conclusion is only as sound
    as the model on which it is based.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This takes a less-divisive, more unifying approach, if you will, treating both
    statistical and machine learning models as tools toward the ultimate goal: understanding
    data. Diego seems much less concerned with which tool is used, focusing instead
    on ensuring that the tool is used properly, a valid model is built, and the result
    is an increased understanding of the data. Debating exactly how statistics relates
    to machine learning is useless if the resulting generalizations are based on invalid
    models, regardless of the approach used in building them.'

    the years. Since my first exposure to both linear regression and, to a lesser
    extent, decision trees -- from the perspective of data mining books and courses
    -- I was originally flabbergasted that these simple concepts could be considered
    "machine learning." This was especially so given that I had already been familiar
    with regression from statistics for quite some time at that point, and no one
    had ever mentioned the term "machine learning" to me in any of these previous
    learning scenarios. I imagine that this is a similar reaction that others in my
    position have had at similar periods of their educations and/or careers.

- en: For some quick context, as I have also considered at length the [relationship
    between data mining and machine learning](/2017/01/data-science-puzzle-revisited.html)
    -- which can also become an act of futility -- I like to think of data mining
    as a *process*, and machine learning as the *tool* which facilitates this process.
    Adding in that a modern [definition of statistics](http://www.statoo.com/en/statistics/)
    (via Kuonen) is "the science of learning from data (or making sense out of data),
    and of measuring, controlling and communicating uncertainty," I am happy with
    the quick-and-dirty definition of data mining as "high speed statistical analysis
    at scale."
  prefs: []

- en: 'A similarly simplified definition is that machine learning is made up of 3
    things: 1) data, 2) a model or estimator, and 3) a cost or loss to minimize. The
    entire *raison dêtre* of machine learning is the process of optimizing a loss
    function, which takes similar statistical problems which humans can solve by hand
    and greatly increases the amount and/or nature of data which can be entertained.'

    the simplest form of regression analysis -- meet these requirements?

    points, plot 9 of them, holding the 10th back for "testing," and I solve an equation
    and plot the results by hand, is this machine learning? If it is not -- and it
    clearly isn't -- where does the transition to machine learning occur? 100 data
    points? A significant enough number of instance attributes? Simply the use of
    a computer? I prefer to think of "traditional" statistics and machine learning
    as being at opposite ends of a spectrum, and the blurred area of transition between
    the 2 as being permanently undefined and undefinable.

    of machine learning that we should "[t]hink of it simply as a branch of statistics,
    designed for a world of big data," an opinion which Kuonen has shown some appreciation
    for. [Kuonen has also noted](http://www.statoo.com/en/datamining/) that while
    one could argue that "data mining is statistics at scale and speed" (Daryl Pregibon,
    1999), he notes that there is a difference in their approaches, [which you can
