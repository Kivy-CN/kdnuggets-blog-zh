  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event/something happening.
    It is an important element in predictive analysis allowing you to explore the
    computational math behind your outcome.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Using a simple example, let’s look at tossing a coin: either heads (H) or tails
    (T). Your probability will be the number of ways an event can occur divided by
    the total number of possible outcomes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and Tails) = 0.5.

- en: But we don’t want to get likelihood and probability confused - there is a difference.
    Probability is the measure of a specific event or outcome occurring. Likelihood
    is applied when you want to increase the chances of a specific event or outcome
    occurring.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is about hypotheses.

- en: Another term to know is  ‘’mutually exclusive events'’. These are events that
    do not occur at the same time. For example, you cannot go right and left at the
    same time. Or if we’re flipping a coin, we can either get heads or tails, not
    both.

    and is based on the foundation of reasoning. Using theory, the outcome is the
    expected value. Using the head and tails example, the theoretical probability
    of landing on heads is 0.5 or 50%.'

    during an experiment duration. Using the head and tails example - if we were to
    toss a coin 10 times and it landed on heads 6 times, the experimental probability
    of the coin landing on heads would be 6/10 or 60%.'

    on an existing event/outcome. For example, if you’re working for an insurance
    company, you may want to find the probability of a person being able to pay for
    his insurance based on the condition that they have taken out a house loan.

    the possible values and probabilities for a random variable within a given range.
    The range will have possible minimum and maximum values, and where they are plotted
    on a distribution graph depend on statistical tests.

    type of distribution you are using. I will break them down into two categories:
    discrete distribution and continuous distribution.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Discrete Distribution
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Discrete distribution is when the data can only take on certain values or has
    a limited number of outcomes. For example, if you were to roll a die, your limited
    values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are different types of discrete distribution. For example:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Discrete uniform distribution** is when all the outcomes are equally likely.
    If we use the example of rolling a six-sided die, there is an equal probability
    that it can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 - ⅙. However, the problem with discrete
    uniform distribution is that it does not provide us with relevant information,
    which data scientists can use and apply.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Bernoulli Distribution** is another type of discrete distribution, where
    the experiment only has two possible outcomes, either yes or no, 1 or 2, true
    or false. This can be used when flipping a coin, it is either head or tails. When
    using the Bernoulli distribution, we have the probability of one of the outcomes
    (p) and we can deduct it from the total probability (1), represented as (1-p).'

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Binomial Distribution** is a sequence of Bernoulli events and is the discrete
    probability distribution that can only produce two possible results in an experiment,
    either success or failure. When flipping a coin, the probability of flipping a
    coin will always be 1.5 or ½ in every experiment conducted.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Poisson Distribution** is the distribution of how many times an event is
    likely to occur over a specified period or distance. Rather than focusing on an
    event occurring, it focuses on the frequency of an event occurring in a specific
    interval. For example, if 12 cars go down a particular road at 11 am every day,
    we can use Poisson distribution to figure out how many cars go down that road
    at 11 am in a month.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike discrete distributions which have finite outcomes, continuous distributions
    have continuum outcomes. These distributions typically appear as a curve or a
    line on a graph as the data is continuous.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Normal Distribution** is one that you may have heard of as it is the most
    frequently used. It is a symmetrical distribution of the values around the mean,
    with no skew. The data follows a bell shape when plotted, where the middle range
    is the mean. For example, characteristics such as height, and IQ scores follow
    a normal distribution.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**T-Distribution** is a type of continuous distribution used when the population
    standard deviation (σ) is unknown and the sample size is small (n<30). It follows
    the same shape as a normal distribution, the bell curve. For example, if we’re
    looking at how many chocolate bars were sold in a day, we would use the normal
    distribution. However, if we want to look into how many were sold in a specific
    hour, we will use t-distribution.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Exponential distribution** is a type of continuous probability distribution
    that focuses on the amount of time till an event occurs. For example, we may want
    to look into earthquakes and can use exponential distribution. The amount of time,
    starting from this point until an earthquake occurs. The exponential distribution
    is plotted as a curved line and represents the probabilities exponentially.'

- en: From the above, you can see how data scientists can use probability to understand
    more about data and answer questions. It is very useful for data scientists to
    know and understand the chances of an event occurring and can be very effective
    in the decision-making process.

    before performing any form of analysis. Looking at the data distribution can give
    you a lot of information and can use this to adjust your task, process and model
    to cater to the data distribution.
