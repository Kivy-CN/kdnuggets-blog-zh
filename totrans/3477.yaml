    Report” – but today, we are beginning to see those then fictitious yet fantastical
    methods of predicting and preventing crime being implemented in various parts
    of the world. I’ll briefly mention three examples below of how analytics is already
    being used to prevent crime today before going into more detail on a fourth example:
    using analytics to prevent a criminal from re-offending.'

    for over two decades.  It has of course evolved over this time.  [Today PrePol
    utilises algorithms to identify crime “hot-spots”](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/25/predicting-crime-lapd-los-angeles-police-data-analysis-algorithm-minority-report). 
    The results have been positive.  In double blinded trials they have been twice
    as good as traditional methods of prevention.

    meters” that will allow the likes of our electricity public utility company, Eskom,
    and municipalities to predict cable theft and identify illegal connections.  In
    the US, [electricity theft is seen as the third largest form of theft](http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2013/12/02/using-analytics-to-crack-down-on-electricity-theft/)
     and the introduction of  [Meter Data Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter#Advanced_metering_infrastructure) and
    “Smart Grid Infrastructure” means that every single second large packets of data
    are being generated ready to be analysed – [a true Big Data problem](/finding-value-in-transaction-data-part-1). 
    This type of “Smart Grid Infrastructure” is [being used also with water utilities

    crime through Big Data surveillance](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-03/china-tries-its-hand-at-pre-crime?utm_source=digg)
    in a country where data privacy laws are limited.  Under government mandate the
    country’s largest state-run defense contractor is building an analytics software
    platform that will be able to cross-reference information from bank accounts,
    jobs, hobbies, consumption patterns, and footage from surveillance cameras to
    identify potential terrorists. As of the 1^(st) of January of this year, Chinese
    authorities have been granted access to bank accounts, telecommunications and
    a national network of surveillance cameras called – oddly enough – Skynet. Picture
    a world where police officers wearing augmented reality glasses are able to identify
    each individual in a crowd.

    media activity, demographic data and police records is pulled and run through
    an algorithm. From here a potential perpetrator of a crime is then identified
    and the police can take or plan their action.  This “Robocop” type scenario is
    no longer so far in the future in China.

- en: This month the “Journal of Empirical Legal Studies” [published a paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12098/abstract) which
    detailed a large study where machine learning had been used to determine whether
    it could feasibly be used to assist judges in domestic violence arraignment /
    bail hearings, i.e. should an arrested individual be granted bail or not.

- en: In this study, 28,000 domestic violence arraignment hearings were assessed over
    the period 2007-2011 (observation period).  Then those 28,000 individuals were
    assessed to see whether they had re-offended or not in the next two years (outcome
    period).  The machine looked at over 35 characteristics, including previous convictions
    and charges, and demographic data, such as age and gender.  Random forests (a
    statistical technique) were built to assess the likelihood of re-offending.

- en: Even with the relatively small amount of data fields used, the outcomes were
    impressive.  Typically the courts would have granted bail to the majority of those
    at arraignment, and 20% were shown to have re-offended in the next 24 months. 
    The analysis showed that the model could have selected better with only 10% of
    them re-offending.

    well, but the models are not perfect and the errors have significant social consequences. 
    Here courts would need to assess the impact of false-positives: identifying someone
    as a likely repeat offender (although they are not) and denying them bail, which
    could cost them their jobs and possibly their homes while being detained.  False-negatives
    – being released on bail and re-offending although the model predicted otherwise
    – are also noteworthy.  Despite the sophistication of the models, they are unlikely
    to be able to take into account all the subtle information available to a judge.'

    and if the model performs better than human intervention alone, it should not
    be ignored.

    using [machine learning](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wfan/PAPERS/AAAI97Workshop.pdf).
    A false-positives may lead to freezing of credit cards, which would lead to inconvenience
    to the credit card holder and a high number of customer services calls.  Banks
    need to determine their threshold for accepting questionable transactions.

- en: Analytics and specifically machine learning are proving to have far-reaching
    applications not only in industry and commerce, but also in crime-prevention and
    in the courts.  The fighting and management of crime empirically is in its infancy. 
    This study is just one of many on the go.
