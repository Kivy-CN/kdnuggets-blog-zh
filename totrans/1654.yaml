    science is a key driver of innovation, but few organizations know how to consistently
    turn data science output into business value. Sixty percent of companies plan
    to double the size of their data science teams in 2018\. Ninety percent believe
    data science contributes to business innovation. However, less than nine percent
    can actually quantify the business impact of all their models, and only 11 percent
    can claim more than 50 predictive models working in production. This data stems
    from a recent [survey](https://www.dominodatalab.com/resources/key-factors-journey-become-model-driven/)
    of more than 250 data science leaders and practitioners.'

    that view data science as a technical practice and those that go further to embrace
    data science as an organizational capability woven throughout the business fabric.
    Companies that have mastered the technical and management practices necessary
    to embed algorithmic-driven decision-making at the core of the business are reaping
    the most returns. They can be considered “model-driven.” (Think of Amazon, Netflix,
    Stitch Fix and Tesla as examples.)

- en: '**Silos of knowledge.** Hiring data scientists does not guarantee that your
    organization will profit from data science. For most firms, adding a data scientist
    to the team does not generate the same output as previous data scientists — you
    get diminishing returns to scale, instead of the exponential returns that high-functioning
    data science teams achieve. A recurring theme is that data scientists working
    on individual laptops or other siloed environments often duplicate efforts. They
    don’t have visibility into what work has been done by others that they could benefit
    from. One major insurance company, for instance, had dozens of scientists working
    in uncoordinated ways on the same business problems — leading to lost investment
    and missed opportunities. There’s a difference, in other words, between having
    a collection of individuals who create models, and having a dynamic team capable
    of leveraging its collective knowledge, skills and past work to collaboratively
    build better and better models with faster time to value.'

- en: '**Friction in model deployment.** Well-run data science teams operate within
    a continuous and iterative lifecycle — from research to production, and back -
    and measure the impact of models in production. Unfortunately, the research process
    is too often completely separate from model deployment process - and when (if)
    a model is deployed there is no link to business impact. If this rings true to
    you, then your organization likely cannot iterate on models that are deployed
    to improve them and worse yet, fails to measure business impact of their models.
    One major financial services firm said they “build their new headquarters in less
    time than it took to get a model into production.”'

- en: '**Tool and technology mismatch**. IT departments have spent the last decade-plus
    building a big data infrastructure to support data storage and processing – but
    that infrastructure doesn’t necessarily lend itself to data science. Data scientists
    can use as many as 3-5 different tools or packages monthly, leveraging the latest
    packages consistently. There were over 365,000 updates to the popular open-source
    programming language Python in 2017 alone! Furthermore, data science work demands
    access to elastic compute to perform specific experiments, like deep learning
    that requires powerful machines with GPUs. Lacking access to elastic compute and
    the latest tools limits your team’s agility,  constrains the pace of research
    - and results in delayed development.  Even worse, sometimes the result is shadow
    IT, as was the case with a large global bank where it took so long to approve
    new Python packages that data scientists ended up bringing their personal laptops
    to work and covertly using them.'

    more harm than good. If you are actively managing models in production, then you’ve
    likely realized this. A model that is not tightly monitored or actively controlled
    can cause serious harm to the business, either in the form of compliance failures,
    revenue losses, damage to brand or reputation. Knight Capital Group, for instance,
    [lost $440 million in 45 minutes](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/knight-capital-says-trading-mishap-cost-it-440-million/)
    after a mistake in updating a model. This is an extreme scenario, but makes the
    case that organizations must continually validate and monitor their models for
    misuse and performance degradation.'

    five to ten years looks for your organization. If you’d consider your company
    a laggard with respect to data science maturity, seek consolation in the fact
    that you’re not alone: some 46 percent of all survey respondents, in fact, fell
    into the laggard category. Forty percent are considered “aspiring,” and a mere
    14 percent rose to the top and demonstrated ability to manage data science as
    an organizational capability.'

    science, your organization must develop and implement a consistent and sensible
    framework around people, process, and technology. Companies that put the time
    and energy into this framework, and that successfully leverage data science as
    a core business competency, are reaping the rewards. Netflix, for example, integrates
    models into each part of their business; they estimate [a billion dollars](http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-recommendation-engine-worth-1-billion-per-year-2016-6)
    in incremental value from their personalization and recommendation models alone.

    are significant barriers that must be overcome. But ultimately, those that solve
    the hard problems -- figuring out how to develop and deploy and high-impact models
    at scale, and truly instrumenting their businesses with data science -- are better
    equipped to leverage them for competitive advantage over the long term.'
