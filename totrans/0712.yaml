    Whenever attempting to make sense of our data, being able to describe it in particular
    ways is important. These same descriptive tools are useful for sharing summative
    aspects of our data with others. Mastering the following common data description
    methodologies are your key to being able to understand your data better, and to
    better be able to understand the rest of the content on Statology.

    of a dataset. This value can also be referred to as “the central location” of
    a dataset.
