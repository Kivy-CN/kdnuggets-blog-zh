- en: I thought [Drew Conway's](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram)
    early attempt at defining data science by Venn diagram was formidable, if not
    ultimately flawed due mostly to the passage of time, along with a shifting perception
    of what data science actually is. It used to be a great way to visually attempt
    to explain to people what it is you did or aspired to do, when, after attempting
    a considered and well-constructed verbal explanation, you got only a blank stare
    in return. Or some retort like, "Oh, you do Big Data?" Or the wildly more elementary
    (and incredibly frustrating), "Do you work with computers? You know, my screen
    isn't working. Mind have a look-see?"

    reason, since that seems more a skills of data scientists (practitioners) as opposed
    to the field of data science itself. Semantics, perhaps. Of course, that's just
    my opinion, and a minor criticism of what clearly served a purpose for a particular
    period of time.

    is and does. There is no consensus on what makes up a data scientist - we won't
    even consider that here - and unicorns are best left in the bedtime stories I
    tell my daughter. But the fact that data science is still (*in perpetuum*?) an
    unsettled concept does not mean that we shouldn't **try** to narrow it down, and
    be open to attempts of others to do so. This is where Stephan Kolassa's new [Data
    Scientist Venn Diagram](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/2403/data-science-without-knowledge-of-a-specific-topic-is-it-worth-pursuing-as-a-ca)

    Expertise (shortened to "Programming", "Statistics" and "Business" for legibility)
    are important... but I think that the role of Communication is important, too.
    All the insights you derive by leveraging your hacking, stats and business expertise
    won't make a bit of a difference unless you can communicate them to people who
    may not have that unique blend of knowledge. You may need to explain your statistical
    insights to a business manager who needs to be convinced to spend money or change
    processes. Or to a programmer who doesn't think statistically.

    to catch some heat and get people talking, it is useful to have a look at, especially
    when comparing your view of what a data scientist is to that of others. Is this
    a necessary undertaking? Absolutely not. But it's fun. And we all do it.

    get too hung up on trying to find one that has every single skill you think you
    need or have been told that data scientists have. There is much to be said for
    creating diverse teams that collectively have the requisite skills, knowledge
    and experience — a sort of crowdsourced data scientist.
