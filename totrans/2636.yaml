- en: Here I feature more questions I usually see asked during interviews. I shall
    note that this isn’t an interview prep guide nor a conclusive list of all questions.
    Rather, you should use this article as a refresher for your Machine Learning knowledge.
    I suggest reading the question then try to answer it yourself before reading the
    answer. This way, you will validate your knowledge and learn where are your skill
    gaps. Let’s get started.

    learning. In ANN, we have layers, neurons, activation functions, weights, and
    backpropagation. You should be familiar with all these terms. If not, then read [Neurons,
    Activation Functions, Back-Propagation, Epoch, Gradient Descent: What are these?](https://towardsdatascience.com/neurons-activation-functions-back-propagation-epoch-gradient-descent-what-are-these-c80349c6c452)'

- en: CNN is a **Convolution Neural Network ****with** its main application in computer
    vision and video analytics in general. CNN deals with the issue of how to enter
    an image in an ANN, how to capture the important features of an image and convert
    it into a format that can be fed in the neural network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CNN takes an image and passes it through the below steps
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**1 - Convolution**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The image is converted into 0’s and 1’s and then multiplied by a feature detector
    to produce a feature map. The main reason for this step is to reduce the size
    of the input image. Some information might get lost, but the main features of
    the image will get captured. Usually, the image is multiplied by multiple feature
    detectors to produce multiple feature maps. These feature maps go through a function,
    usually, ReLU, to ensure non-linearity in the image.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several pooling operations, but the most common is max pooling. It
    teaches the network spatial variance. In simple words, the ability to recognize
    the image features even if the image is upside down, tilted, or the image is taken
    from far or close, etc. The output of this operation is a pooled feature map.

    in a format that can be input to the ANN.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RNN is **Recurrent Neural Networks** that is mainly used for time series problems
    like stock market forecasting. They are famous for **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory).
    Similar to ANN, there are input and output layers along with multiple layers of
    neurons in between, but the main difference is that RNN neurons have a sort of
    short-term memory. This short-term memory provides the neurons with the possibility
    to remember what was in this neuron previously. This is the reason RNN is good
    for time series problems and translation since the network will need to know the
    previous translated word in order to create a coherent sentence rather than just
    translate each word on its own.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Factorization Machines can be used for classification or regression and are
    much more computationally efficient on **large sparse data sets** than traditional
    algorithms like linear regression. This property is why Factorization Machines
    are widely used for recommendation. Factorization Machines are supervised learning
    algorithms, and their main use is handling spare data. However, they don’t perform
    dimensionality reduction. An example of Factorization Machines use is ad click
    prediction and item recommendation.

    working with credit card fraud data and there are very few real fraud cases while
    the majority of the cases are non-fraudulent.*'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating a model with an unbalanced dataset will yield bad results in terms
    of favoring more training data, in our case, the non-fraudulent transactions.
    You should never create a model with an unbalanced dataset. The answer should
    be around trying to gather more balanced data and, if not possible, then oversample
    your data using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over Sampling) **or** Random Over
    Sampling (ROS)**.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in this case, the fraudulent observations. These synthetic observations are almost
    identical to the original fraudulent observations. This technique is expeditious,
    but the types of synthetic observations it produces are not as useful as the unique
    observations created by other oversampling techniques.

- en: '*Q5\. What’s regularization, and what’s the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?*'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regularization in machine learning is the process of regularizing the parameters
    that constrain, regularizes, or shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero.
    In other words, this technique discourages learning of a more complex or flexible
    model, avoiding the risk of overfitting. Regularization basically adds the penalty
    as model complexity increases, which can help avoid overfitting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**L1 effectively removes features** that are unimportant, and doing this too
    aggressively can lead to underfitting. **L2 weighs each feature** instead of removing
    them entirely, which can lead to better accuracy. Briefly, L1 removes features
    while L2 doesn’t, and L2 regulates their weights instead.'

- en: '*Q6\. What’s transfer learning? How it’s useful?*'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Transfer Learning** allows you to start with an existing trained model, usually
    off the shelf from a source like GitHub. You take the existing trained model and
    apply it to your different but closely aligned observations. This saves you time
    deploying and operationalizing your machine learning solution since you are starting
    from a pre-trained model.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Transfer Learning, the network is initialized with pre-trained weights, and
    just the top fully connected layer is initialized with random weights. Then, the
    whole network is fine-tuned with new data. In this mode, training can be achieved
    even with a smaller dataset. This is because the network is already trained and
    therefore, can be used in cases without sufficient training data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing that comes to my mind when I hear regression model evaluation
    is **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** because it’s the most simple and common metric
    for regression evaluation. RMSE can easily tell if the model is overestimating
    or underestimating.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RMSE is the gap between the predicted numerical target and the true numerical
    answer (i.e., true numerical value). The smaller the value of RMSE, the better
    the prediction accuracy of the model. If the model’s prediction is correct, its
    RMSE will be 0.
