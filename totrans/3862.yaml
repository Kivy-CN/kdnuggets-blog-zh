- en: Last week, GitHub publicly unveiled **[Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/)**,
    the preview of its "AI pair programmer," a code completion style tool designed
    to provide line or function suggestions in your IDE. It has certainly made waves
    in the world of programming and beyond, and you have likely heard at least something
    about it.

- en: But Copilot is more than simple autocomplete and is more context aware than
    other code assistants. Powered by OpenAI's Codex AI system, Copilot contextualizes
    a situation using docstrings, function names, comments, and preceding code to
    best generate and suggest what it determines to be the most appropriate code.
    Copilot is designed to improve over time, "learning" from how developers use it.

    backend — such as GitHub's Codespaces — Copilot "understands" dozens of languages,
    with the technical preview being noted as doing "especially well for Python, JavaScript,
    TypeScript, Ruby, and Go." You can accept default code suggestions, cycle through
    additional proposals, modify the code you accept, or ignore Copilot suggestions
    at a particular point in your code altogether.

- en: More so than anything, I am excited about the "comments-to-code" context use
    case of Copilot, in particular as relates to function docstrings. As a good programmer,
    you should be writing (and I certainly do!) quality docstrings for your functions,
    after you have planned out what the function should do, and prior to implementing
    said function. With the use of Copilot, we should be able to devote more time
    to the planning and documenting steps, and perhaps skip much of the initial phase
    of the implementation step altogether, focusing instead on tweaking the generated
    code afterwards.

    change the way I write code to some degree.

    Even more noteworthy, it is not something that is theoretical or impractical;
    Copilot is immediately useful and poised to have an actual impact on how coding
    is performed.
