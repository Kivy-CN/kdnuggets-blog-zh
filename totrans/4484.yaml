    processing (NLP) resources in the recent past, most notably [The Big Bad NLP Database](/2020/02/big-bad-nlp-database.html)
    and [The Super Duper NLP Repo](/2020/04/super-duper-nlp-repo.html), a pair of
    initiatives managed by Quantum Stat. The first of these is a curated repository
    of NLP datasets neatly organized around tasks, while the second is a collection
    of Google Colab notebooks demonstrating implementations of numerous of these tasks.

    & Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/nlp-recipes) repository, by Microsoft,
    is another worthy addition to this collection. The repository describes its usefulness
    as such:'

    provided as Jupyter notebooks and utility functions. The focus of the repository
    is on state-of-the-art methods and common scenarios that are popular among researchers
    and practitioners working on problems involving text and language.

    to NLP tasks as they are guidance for ensuring you imeplement your systems with
    the best practices in mind.

    that leverage recent advances in NLP algorithms, neural architectures, and distributed
    machine learning systems. [...] We hope that the tools can significantly reduce
    the “time to market” by simplifying the experience from defining the business
    problem to development of solution by orders of magnitude. In addition, the example
    notebooks would serve as guidelines and showcase best practices and usage of the
    tools in a wide variety of languages.

    the repo also lays out that NLP "is not synonymous with English," and ensure that
    the goal of the project "is to provide end-to-end examples in as many languages
    as possible," encouraging community contributions in order to facilitate.

    notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/nlp-recipes/tree/master/examples/text_classification).
    There are a few different notebooks which use different combinations of dataset,
    natural language, environment (local or Azure cloud-based), language model, and
    task focus.

    module to help alleviate some of the "tedious tasks ranging from data loading,
    dataset understanding, model development, model evaluation to productionize a
    trained NLP model." Be sure to check out the utilities developed by Microsoft
    Research which are intended to save time and speed up some of the more laborious
    tasks associated with natural language processing.

    to frameworks and libraries, to language models, to dataset collections, and beyond.
    If you are too, I suggest you check out this best practice-oriented repo from
    Microsoft.
