    the field and know all the major tools and techniques you’ll need to thrive in
    the industry. However, that’s not necessarily the case. In reality, data science
    changes just as rapidly and readily as the world itself – all the time!

    or finance, is larger and more robust than ever before. This is great for front-line
    data scientists or those using talked-about technologies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why? Because it makes it easy for data scientists to stay abreast of new developments
    like [machine learning](https://dataconomy.com/2021/05/machine-learning-vs-artificial-intelligence-future-data-science/),
    keep an eye on how the industry is evolving, and learn new things just by reading
    blog posts about data science itself.

- en: Not only is this great for your career and your mental health, but it’s also
    excellent for your [understanding of data science](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-data-science/)
    as a specialty. Plus, no matter how good you are at data science natively, the
    odds are there are at least a couple of gaps in your understanding.

    in those gaps and leave you with a more holistic understanding of the industry
    overall. On top of all that, if you develop a healthy blogging habit, you’ll maintain
    a learning routine that will serve you well into middle age and beyond.'

    But it’s also good to ensure that you are always at the forefront of data science
    as a field. If you apply for and are hired for higher-paying positions, you’ll
    have a greater opportunity to interact with new data science technologies and
    techniques.
