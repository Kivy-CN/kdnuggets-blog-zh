  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science is the field of study of driving meaningful and purpose-driven
    insights and analyses from data. It is a multidisciplinary method that incorporates
    several principles from artificial intelligence, computer engineering, mathematics,
    and statistics to analyze a large amount of data. Data science involves programming,
    and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract goal-oriented data insights
    or analytics. So when data science is used with an industry domain or business
    niche, it helps in improving business intelligence and performance.

- en: Data science is primarily computer programming. It focuses on developing AI
    & ML models for automatically analyzing large-volume data. A data scientist takes
    the charge of building data processing pipelines, preparing application analytics,
    designing architecture, and creating machine learning models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These ML models then hand over to app developers to integrate into mobile apps.
    So, data science in mobile app development primarily focuses on data ingestion,
    AI & ML model development, and its deployment into mobile apps. Data science also
    helps app developers in transforming and redeploying the ML models for newly labeled
    data or any other kind of changes in model inputs.

- en: However, the mobile app developer here takes complete charge of creating and
    maintaining the mobile application. Data science mainly works as a component to
    integrate an automated data analysis model. Therefore, both parties data scientists
    and app developers work together hand-in-hand in the mobile app development process.
    Since machine learning and [artificial intelligence can change mobile apps](/2022/12/artificial-intelligence-change-mobile-apps.html),
    the use of data science in app development has huge scope.

    generally collect substantial amounts of data and analytics. Especially in the
    case of e-commerce, business, and enterprise-scale, mobile apps have to manage
    an enormous range of data. However, to handle such an amount of data, mobile apps
    are integrated with APIs or cloud services.

    there is a drastic need for an effective or intelligent technology solution that
    could not only handle large data sizes but also assist in deriving business-driven
    insights. Here are further benefits of integrating data science in mobile app
    development:'

- en: This is one of the top advantages of using data science in mobile app development.
    It helps developers and app development companies to uncover problems which might
    overlook in the development. Generally, errors or flaws in mobile apps come into
    notice after deployment. As a result, the development team and app owners have
    to suffer from spending unnecessary efforts and increased costs.

    apps. It uses programmed algorithms to detect patterns in unstructured and unrelated
    data. Many developers use data science in [android app development](https://ripenapps.com/android-app-development)
    for detecting bugs and technical glitches before final deployment. Hence, data
    science helps in detecting hidden issues and ensures a flawless development process.
