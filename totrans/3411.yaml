    contest](/2016/06/kdnuggets-blog-contest-automated-data-science.html), which garnered
    numerous entries and lots of appreciation for the winning posts and a pair of
    honorable mentions.

    Auto-sklearn](/2016/08/winning-automl-challenge-auto-sklearn.html), written by
    Matthias Feurer, Aaron Klein, and Frank Hutten, all of the University of Freiburg,
    provides an overview of [Auto-sklearn](http://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/),
    an open-source Python tool that automatically determines effective machine learning
    pipelines for classification and regression datasets. The project is built around
    the successful scikit-learn library and won the recent AutoML challenge.'

    in answering a few followup questions on themselves, their project, and automated
    data science in general. What follows is the result of this conversation.

    my study projects up to that point.'

- en: One short-term goal is regression, where we can do a lot more. In the long term
    we would like Auto-sklearn to become a flexible extension of scikit-learn, which
    helps users optimize their machine learning pipelines. We also want to do lots
    more work along the lines of Auto-Net, and want to speed up the optimization process
    dramatically by more reasoning across datasets, across subsets of data, and over
    time (for anytime algorithms).

- en: While there are several approaches for tuning the hyperparameters of machine
    learning pipelines, so far there is only little work on discovering new pipeline
    building blocks. Auto-sklearn uses a predefined set of preprocessors and classifiers
    in a fixed order. An efficient way to also come up with new pipelines would be
    helpful. One can of course continue this line of thinking and try to automate
    the discovery of new algorithms as done in several recent papers, such as ​*Learning
    to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent*. Humans can also still tune
    hyperparameters better than automated methods when machine learning models are
    very expensive to train, such as state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large
    datasets. We’re working on ways to transform human expert heuristics into fully
    formalized algorithms; e.g., our [Fabolas approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07079)​
    optimizes the hyperparameters of a neural network on small subsets of the data
    to speed up learning about the best hyperparameters for the full data set.

    be tempered by automation in the near future, and if so, to what degree?**'

- en: Certainly not. All the methods of automated machine learning are developed to
    support data scientists, not to replace them. Such methods can free the data scientist
    from nasty, complicated tasks (like hyperparameter optimization) that can be solved
    better by machines. But analysing and drawing conclusions still has to be done
    by human experts -- and in particular data scientists who know the application
    domain will remain extremely important. We do believe, though, that automation
    will make individual data scientists a lot more productive, so this might indeed
    affect the number of data scientists needed to do the job.

    a statistical analysis -- so for young graduates starting data science jobs such
    skills might be more future-proof than some others (e.g., manual hyperparameter
    tuning to get the most out of your neural network).

    of experiments, while resampling strategies such as careful cross-validation are
    needed to prevent against overfitting. It's also often important to go in with
    an open mind and just let the data speak about which method works best on which
    dataset.

    that’s changing as quickly as machine learning. E.g., five years ago not many
    foresaw the rise of deep learning. But we’re fairly confident that machine learning
    will be used ever more and will be embedded in commercial tools everyone uses.
