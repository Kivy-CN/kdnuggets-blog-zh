    data, primary data, internal data — the list goes on. A common confusion is the
    difference between these terms and understanding the difference is quite significant.

    data. If you use data from Google Analytics to understand how many people visit
    your website, you're using secondary data. It's still data on your organization,
    but it's something that a secondary organization (in our example, Google) collected
    for you.
