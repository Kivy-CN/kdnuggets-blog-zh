- en: SQL( Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for
    managing and manipulating databases. It's an essential skill for any data professional,
    as it allows them to effectively retrieve and analyze data stored in a database.
    As a result, SQL is a common topic in technical interviews for positions that
    involve working with data, similar to data analysts, data engineers, and database
    administrators.

    the speed of queries that filter on those columns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Partitioning **'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Partitioning a large table into smaller pieces can improve the performance of
    queries that only need to access a subset of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Normalization **'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normalization involves organizing the data in a database so that each piece
    of data is stored in only one place, reducing redundancy and perfecting the integrity
    of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Use of appropriate data types **'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the correct data type for each column can improve the performance of queries
    that filter or sort on those columns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Use of appropriate JOIN types **'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the correct JOIN type(e.g., INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN) can improve
    the performance of queries that join multiple tables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Use of appropriate aggregate functions**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using appropriate aggregate functions(e.g., SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) can improve
    the performance of queries that perform calculations on large sets of data. Some
    aggregate functions, similar to COUNT, are more effective than others, so it's
    important to choose the applicable function for your query.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you use the LAG and LEAD functions in SQL? Can you give an example of
    their use?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The LAG() and LEAD() functions are window functions in SQL that allow you to
    compare values in a row with values in a preceding or following row, respectively.
    They're useful for calculating running totals, or for comparing values in a table
    with values in a previous or subsequent row.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the number of rows to go back. For example'
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Explain ETL and ELT concept in SQL
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ETL( Extract, Transform, Load) is a process used in SQL to extract data from
    one or more sources, transform the data into a format suitable for analysis or
    other uses, and then load the data into a target system, such as a data warehouse
    or data lake.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ELT( Extract, Load, Transform) is similar to ETL, but the Transform phase is
    performed after the data is loaded into the target system, rather than before.
    This allows the target system to perform the transformations, which can be more
    efficient and scalable than performing the transformations in an ETL tool. ELT
    is often used in modern data infrastructures, which use powerful data processing
    engines( such as Apache Spark or Apache Flink) to perform the Transform phase.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can you explain the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses in SQL
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The WHERE and HAVING clauses are both used to filter rows from a SELECT statement.
    The main difference between the two is that the WHERE clause is used to filter
    rows before the group by operation, while the HAVING clause is used to filter
    rows after the group by operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE5]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this example, the HAVING clause is used to filter out any departments where
    the sum of the salaries for employees in that department is less than 100000\.
    This is done after the group by operation, so it only affects the rows that represent
    each department.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE6]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this example, the WHERE clause is used to filter out any employees with a
    salary of less than 50000\. This is done before any group by operation, so it
    affects all rows in the employees table.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**TRUNCATE**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The TRUNCATE operation removes all rows from a table, but it doesn't affect
    the structure of the table. It's faster than DELETE, because it doesn't generate
    any undo or redo logs and doesn't fire any delete triggers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's an example of using the TRUNCATE statement
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE7]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE

    including column names and data types, remains unchanged.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**DROP**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DROP operation removes a table from the database and removes all data in
    the table. It also removes any indexes, triggers, and constraints associated with
    the table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's an example of using the DROP statement
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE8]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This statement removes the employees table from the database and all data in
    the table is permanently deleted. The table structure is also removed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**DELETE**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DELETE operation removes one or more rows from a table. It allows you to
    specify a WHERE clause to select the rows to delete. It also generates undo and
    redo logs, and fires cancel triggers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here's an example of using the DELETE statement
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE9]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This statement removes all rows from the employees table where the salary is
    less than 50000 The table structure remains unchanged, and the deleted rows can
    be recovered using the undo logs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which is more efficient join or subquery?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's generally more efficient to use a JOIN rather than a subquery when combining
    data from multiple tables. This is because a JOIN allows the database to execute
    the query more efficiently by using indices on the joined tables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, consider the following two queries that return the same results:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE10]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: '[PRE11]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The first query uses a JOIN to combine the orders and customers tables, and
    then filters the results using a WHERE clause. The second query uses a subquery
    to select the relevant customer IDs from the customers table, and then uses the
    IN operator to filter the orders table based on those IDs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do you use window functions in SQL?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In SQL, a window function is a function that operates on a set of rows, or a"
    window", defined by a window specification. Window functions are used to perform
    calculations across rows, and they can be used in SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements,
    as well as in the WHERE and HAVING clauses of a SELECT statement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here''s an example of using a window function in a SELECT statement:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE12]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'This statement returns a result set with three columns: name, salary, and avg_salary_by_department.
    The avg_salary_by_department column is calculated using the AVG window function,
    which calculates the average salary for each department. The PARTITION BY clause
    specifies that the window is partitioned by department_id, meaning that the average
    salary is calculated separately for each department.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An exclusive lock is a lock that prevents other transactions from reading or
    writing to the locked rows. This type of lock is typically used when a transaction
    needs to modify the data in a table, and it wants to ensure that no other transactions
    can access the table at the same time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An update lock is a lock that allows other transactions to read the locked rows,
    but it prevents them from updating or writing to the locked rows. This type of
    lock is typically used when a transaction needs to read the data in a table, but
    it wants to ensure that the data is not modified by other transactions until the
    current transaction is finished.
