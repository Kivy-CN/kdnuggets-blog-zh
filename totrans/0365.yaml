- en: We are seeing more and more developers interested in taking their careers with
    LLMs to the next level. Natural language processing (NLP) is an area that a lot
    of developers thought they’d not dive into. But with the growth of LLMs and organizations
    such as Cohere providing education content - it’s making the transition a lot
    easier.
