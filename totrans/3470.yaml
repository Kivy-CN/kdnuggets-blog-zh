- en: 'Software engineering is about developing programs or tools to automate tasks.
    Instead of "doing things manually," we write programs; a program is basically
    just a machine-readable set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.
    Let''s consider a classic example: e-mail spam filtering. Assuming that we have
    access to the source code of our e-mail client and know how to handle it, we could
    come up with an instinctive set of rules that may help us with our spam problem.'

    task. Needless to say that we have to test our spam filter on real-world data,
    evaluate and improve it constantly, change and update rules, and so forth. Again,
    our goal is automation: we want to write a set of instructions that automatically
    filters out spam e-mails so that we don''t have to "manually" delete them from
    our e-mail inbox.'

- en: Now, **machine learning is all about automating automation**! Instead of coming
    up with the rules to automate a task such as e-mail spam filtering ourselves,
    **we feed data to a machine learning algorithm, which figures out these rules
    all by itself**. In this context, "data" shall be representative sample of the
    problem we want to solve -- for example, a set of spam and non-spam e-mails so
    that the machine learning algorithm can "learn from experience."

    together with the data, and hope that it produces the desired results.

- en: In machine learning, we take data (e.g., e-mails), provide information about
    the desired results (spam and non-spam labels for these e-mails), and feed it
    to a learning algorithm, which in turn executed by a computer. The computer then
    learns a set of rules that we can use to automate (solve) our problem task.

    to automate a task. Machine learning algorithms are instructions for computers
    to learn other instructions automatically from data or experience. Therefore,
    **machine learning is the automation of automation**.
