    and other analytic processes, statistics and related branches of mathematics,
    increasingly borrows from high performance scientific computing, all in order
    to ultimately extract insight from data and use this new-found information to
    tell stories.

    of short, not-too-technical overviews of particular topics of interest to data
    science newcomers, from basics like supervised vs. unsupervised learning to the
    importance of power law distributions and cognitive biases.

    I thought it was magic. Make significant predictions with accuracy? Sorcery! Curiosity,
    however, quickly leads you to discover that everything is above board, and sound
    scientific and statistical methods bear the responsibility.'

    Data mining. Statistics. Data science.* The concepts and terminology are overlapping
    and seemingly repetitive at times. While there are numerous attempts at clarifying
    much of this (permanently unsettled) uncertainty, this post will tackle the relationship
    between data mining and statistics.

    classification and regression (together: predictive analysis); cluster analysis;
    frequent pattern mining; and outlier analysis. There are all sorts of other ways
    you could break down data mining functionality as well, I suppose, e.g. focusing
    on algorithms, starting with supervised versus unsupervised learning, etc. However,
    this is a reasonable and accepted approach to identifying what data mining is
    able to accomplish, and as such these problems are each covered below, with a
    focus on what can be solved with each "problem."'

    the most used and well-known of the basic ensemble methods. They are not, however,
    the **only** options. Random Forests is another example of an ensemble learner,
    which uses numerous decision trees in a single predictive model, and which is
    often overlooked and treated as a "regular" algorithm. There are other approaches
    to selecting effective algorithms as well, treated below.

- en: Also known as scaling laws, power laws essentially imply that a small number
    of occurrences of some phenomena are frequent, or very common, while a large number
    of of occurrences of the same phenomena are infrequent, or very rare; the exact
    relationship between these relative frequencies differ between power law distributions.
    Some of the wide array of naturally occurring and man made phenomena which power
    laws are able to describe include income disparities, word frequencies of a given
    language, city sizes, website sizes, magnitudes of earthquakes, book sales rankings,
    and surname popularity.
