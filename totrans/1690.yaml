- en: Compared to other summarizing methods, histograms have the richest descriptive
    power while being the fastest way to interpret data – the human brain prefers
    visual perception. However, if you are not careful, viewers will not be able to
    understand your histogram, or you may fail to get the most out of it. It is especially
    important to specify the optimal bin size.

    that are too narrow can cause a lot of noise and hide important information about
    the distribution as well. The width of the bins should be equal, and you should
    only use round values like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, and so on to make it
    easier for the viewer to interpret the data.

    binned histogram, are the occurrences of value “20” represented in the second

    a full-closed interval. We suggest you do this with the last bin when using option
    #2 because uniform bins are usually more important on the left side than on the
    right. If you have integer values, it is recommended to label the bins “10-14,”
    “15-19,” and “20-25” instead of writing out “10,” “15,” “20,” “25.” In this case,
    viewers of the histogram will understand it better.'
