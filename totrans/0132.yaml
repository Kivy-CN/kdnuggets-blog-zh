    since November 2022, many speculate their jobs will be taken over by their AI
    counterparts. One profession, however, cannot be possibly replaced: the researchers
    advancing deep neural networks and other machine learning models – the humans
    behind the AI. Although research is traditionally done within university walls,
    AI is by no means a traditional research field. A sizable portion of AI research
    is done in industrial labs. But which sector should aspiring researchers flock
    toward? Academia or industry?'

  zh: 自2022年11月以来，人工智能进展的飞跃在主流媒体中引起了震撼，许多人猜测他们的工作将被人工智能取代。然而，有一种职业是无法被替代的：推动深度神经网络和其他机器学习模型的研究人员——即人工智能背后的人类。尽管研究传统上是在大学墙内进行的，但人工智能绝非传统的研究领域。相当一部分人工智能研究是在工业实验室中进行的。那么，有志的研究人员应当向哪个领域聚集呢？学术界还是工业界？
- en: “Academia is more inclined to basic fundamental research while the industry
    is inclined to user-oriented research driven by the large data access,” says Nitesh
    Chawla, a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre
    Dame. Prof. Chawla points to the pursuit of knowledge as a separating factor between
    industrial and academic AI research. Within the industry, research is tied to
    a product, advancing towards a better society-- while within academia, the pursuit
    of pure discovery drives research breakthroughs. The seemingly endless academic
    freedom does not come without its drawbacks, “academia does not have the data
    nor the computing access available,” according to Prof. Chawla.

  zh: “学术界更倾向于基础研究，而工业界则倾向于由大数据驱动的面向用户的研究，”诺特丹大学计算机科学与工程系教授**尼特什·乔拉**（Nitesh Chawla）说道。乔拉教授指出，知识追求是工业界和学术界人工智能研究之间的分界线。在工业界，研究与产品挂钩，推动社会进步——而在学术界，纯粹的发现追求推动着研究突破。据乔拉教授说，表面上无尽的学术自由并非没有缺陷，“学术界没有可用的数据或计算资源。”
- en: 'For aspiring young researchers, the choice seems simple: the private sector
    has everything they could want. Vast, autonomous, commercial organizations striving
    toward innovation while supported by readily available data, computing power,
    and funding. This led to a perception that the industry is “stealing” talent away
    from academia. Academics, naturally, complain. A study published in 2021 by a
    team from Aalborg University pointed out that “increasing participation of the
    private sector in AI research has been accompanied by a growing flow of researchers
    from academia into industry, and especially into technology companies such as
    Google, Microsoft, and Facebook”.'

  zh: 对于有志的年轻研究人员来说，选择似乎很简单：私营部门拥有他们所需的一切。庞大、自治的商业组织致力于创新，同时得到随时可用的数据、计算能力和资金的支持。这导致了一个看法，即行业在“挖走”学术界的人才。学术界自然对此有所抱怨。2021年，由奥尔堡大学团队发布的一项研究指出，“私营部门在人工智能研究中的参与增加伴随着越来越多的研究人员从学术界转向工业界，尤其是技术公司如谷歌、微软和Facebook。”
- en: As expected, industrial researchers disagree. “When I hire for my team, I want
    top talent, and as such I’m not poaching academic talent, but rather I am trying
    to help them get industry awards, funding from industry, and have their students
    as interns,” explains Dr. Luna Dong, a Principal Scientist at Meta who is the
    head scientist working on Meta’s smart glasses. She sees a glaring difference
    between industry and academia, which could be credited to the fundamental way
    research is conducted. According to Dr. Dong, AI research within an industry is
    conducted by knowing what the end product should look like and reverse engineering
    a path toward it. In contrast, academics, having a promising idea, continuously
    construct various paths, not knowing where those paths would lead.

  zh: 正如预期的那样，工业研究人员存在分歧。“当我为我的团队招聘时，我希望招募顶尖人才，因此我不会挖掘学术人才，而是帮助他们获得行业奖项、行业资助，并让他们的学生担任实习生，”Meta的首席科学家董博士解释道，她是Meta智能眼镜项目的首席科学家。她认为工业和学术界之间有着显著的差异，这可能归因于研究方法的根本差异。根据董博士的说法，行业内的AI研究是通过了解最终产品应该是什么样子，并向其反向工程。而学术界则在拥有一个有前景的想法后，持续构建各种路径，却不知道这些路径会通向哪里。
- en: Yet, despite these contrasts, Dr. Dong believes the industry helps academia
    and vice versa, “lots of industry breakthroughs are inspired by applying the research
    from academia on real use-cases.” Likewise, Computer Science Professor Ankur Teredesai
    from the University of Washington, Tacoma, describes the relationship between
    industry and academia as supporting each other, “symbiotic is the word that comes
    to mind.” As he views it, research practices have evolved into academics shifting
    their agenda to aid industry products -- a good example of that shift would be
    joint positions within major corporations that some prominent professors are holding.

  zh: 然而，尽管存在这些差异，董博士认为行业帮助学术界，反之亦然，“许多行业突破是通过将学术界的研究应用于实际用例而获得灵感的。”同样，华盛顿大学塔科马分校的计算机科学教授安库尔·特雷德赛（Ankur
    Teredesai）将行业和学术界之间的关系描述为相互支持，“我想到的词是共生的。”在他看来，研究实践已经发展为学术界将其议程转向帮助行业产品——这种转变的一个好例子就是一些知名教授在主要公司担任的联合职位。
- en: 'Regardless of their affiliations, the data science community converges together
    a few times a year at conferences. Prof. Chawla describes them as a “wonderful
    melting pot.” Some conferences are traditionally more academic, some purely industrial
    but some are a perfect blend of both. Prof. Chawla points to KDD, or the Special
    Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, a conference known for
    such a connection. KDD maintains two parallel peer-reviewed tracks: the research
    track and the applied data science (ADS) track. As put by Dr. Dong, who was the
    ADS Program Co-Chair at KDD-2022, “KDD is helpful by providing a forum for researchers
    and practitioners to come together to listen to the talks and discuss the techniques
    while inspiring each other. KDD is a place where we break the barriers of communication
    and collaboration, where we demonstrate how data science and machine learning
    advances with industry consumption.”'

  zh: 无论其隶属关系如何，数据科学界每年会在几次会议上汇聚在一起。查乌拉教授将这些会议描述为“美妙的熔炉”。有些会议传统上更偏学术，有些纯粹是工业性质，但也有些则是二者的完美结合。查乌拉教授提到KDD，即知识发现与数据挖掘特别兴趣小组，这个会议因这种联系而闻名。KDD维持两个平行的同行评审轨道：研究轨道和应用数据科学（ADS）轨道。正如2022年KDD-2022年ADS程序联合主席董博士所说，“KDD通过为研究人员和从业者提供一个论坛，使他们能够聚在一起听讲座和讨论技术，同时相互启发。KDD是一个打破沟通和协作障碍的地方，在这里我们展示了数据科学和机器学习如何随着行业需求而进步。”
- en: This is the mindset that drove KDD from its early days. “One of the things we
    wanted to do from the very beginning was to create a conference where applications
    were well represented,” commends Prof. Usama Fayyad, Executive Director of the
    Institute for Experiential AI at Northeastern University and a former Chief Data
    Officer of Yahoo, who together with Dr. Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro co-founded the
    KDD conference in 1995\. Prof. Fayyad believes that if AI conferences were only
    focused on academics, it would be a big miss due to the collective desire to prove
    research on real problems and motivation to drive new research based on emerging
    data sets.

  zh: 这就是推动KDD从早期发展到现在的思维方式。东北大学体验AI研究所执行主任、前Yahoo首席数据官Usama Fayyad教授称赞道：“我们从一开始就希望创建一个应用得到充分代表的会议。”Fayyad教授和Gregory
    Piatetsky-Shapiro博士于1995年共同创办了KDD会议。Fayyad教授认为，如果AI会议仅专注于学术领域，那么将会错失证明现实问题研究成果和基于新兴数据集推动新研究的集体愿望。
- en: However, opening up KDD to the industry also had its challenges. With the research
    track being rightfully dominated by academia-originated work, the ADS track should
    have been primarily dedicated to applied studies coming from industrial research
    labs. In reality, more than half of ADS publications have their origins within
    academia or are a result of strong academic-industrial collaboration. A decade
    ago, Prof. Fayyad realized that many interesting AI applications were developed
    by teams that were simply too busy to write papers. He led KDD into its current
    phase, where KDD organizers venture and curate distinguished invited talks given
    by top industrial practitioners. The ADS invited talks have quickly become the
    highlight of the conference.

  zh: 然而，将KDD开放给工业界也面临着挑战。尽管研究轨道被学术界主导是合理的，但ADS轨道本应主要致力于来自工业研究实验室的应用研究。实际上，超过一半的ADS出版物都起源于学术界，或是强有力的学术-工业合作的结果。十年前，Fayyad教授意识到，许多有趣的AI应用是由那些忙于其他事务的团队开发的，这些团队根本没有时间撰写论文。他将KDD引领到了现在的阶段，在这里，KDD组织者探索并策划了由顶尖工业实践者所做的杰出邀请演讲。ADS邀请演讲很快成为了会议的亮点。
- en: The KDD Cup competition held annually in conjunction with the KDD conference,
    is yet another way to connect the academic and industrial worlds. “KDD Cup is
    a way to attract both industry and academia participants where companies bring
    some of the challenges that they are comfortable sharing, while academics get
    to work on data they would never have access to,” describes Prof. Teredesai, who
    is also the CEO of a health tech company CueZen. Each year, a novel task is introduced
    and a new dataset is released. Hundreds of teams sprint towards the most effective
    solution, competing for prizes and fame. Prof. Fayyad agrees, “It's been a very
    healthy thing for the field because we see participation from academia, students
    diving in, or even companies teaming together”.

  zh: 每年与KDD会议同时举行的KDD Cup竞赛是连接学术界和工业界的另一种方式。“KDD Cup是吸引行业和学术参与者的方式，公司带来一些他们乐于分享的挑战，而学术界则可以处理他们通常无法获得的数据。”
    Teredesai教授说，他也是健康科技公司CueZen的首席执行官。每年，都会介绍一个新的任务并发布一个新的数据集。数百支团队全力以赴寻求最有效的解决方案，争夺奖品和声誉。Fayyad教授同意，“这对领域而言是一件非常健康的事情，因为我们看到来自学术界的参与，学生们的投入，甚至是公司之间的合作。”
- en: Circling back to the choice between industry and academia, it will soon become
    irrelevant. With academic courses taught by practitioners, professors leading
    industrial labs, global cloud computing resources becoming dominant, and more
    data becoming available, the academic-industrial boundaries are quickly getting
    blurred in the AI domain. No need to stick to any of the two sectors, just choose
    the project you are most excited about!
