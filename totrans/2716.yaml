- en: In a study conducted by Gartner, they found that despite advances in AI and
    ML initiatives, majority of analytics projects fail primarily due the lack of
    ability to deploy models at the speed of business. Several other studies point
    to the lack of engagement from business users in the analytical solution development
    life cycle being the core issue. From my personal experience with working with
    clients who are taking advantage of analytics in decision making processes, I
    have observed similar patterns and can attest to the findings of these studies.
    The biggest hurdle in creating business value from collected data, is indeed the
    ability to operationalize analytics throughout the organization.

    (1) the business team (problem owners) and (2) Data Science team (analytics subject
    matters experts or model builders), and most importantly (3) technology that can
    facilitate the collaboration between the two. A solution developer’s ability to
    create an interactive user interface with rich visualizations (the application)
    at the early phase of an analytics project in an agile fashion, rather than relying
    on IT to build the user interface (application) after completion of model development,
    is the key in forming collaboration between business and Data Science teams. Enabling
    this collaboration and taking advantage of the business team’s real-time feedback
    will also help in adoption of the end solution while ensuring that models are
    validated and deliver what was intended. Xpress Insight is geared to reduce the
    burden on IT and address their critical requirements while empowering business
    users to take ownership of decisions and change management. Here are a few examples
    from actual client deployments of FICO Xpress Insight in production:'

- en: Data Scientists and Operations Researchers can now deploy their Python models
    into user-friendly, interactive, and scalable apps in FICO Xpress Insight through
    drag and drop functionality. The models can be of any type—statistical regression,
    forecasting, machine learning-based, mathematical programming, etc.—and utilize
    any optimization solver. Users can also leverage the Python package ecosystem,
    explore data, and execute and compare models and their performance. Xpress Insight
    is a scalable deployment platform that helps organizations build business applications
    at the speed of business. It enables collaboration between the data scientist
    and the line of business user by taking highly complex analytic or optimization
    models and turning them into simple point and click applications that help make
    real business decisions. Instead of every Data Scientist repeating the process
    of building out the common components of an end-user application, Insight has
    all the core building blocks in a repeatable framework that can be shared with
    the rest of the Data Science team to reduce development time.

    capability that Data Scientists can take advantage of to easily deploy their Python
    models with minimal changes to their code. The Python model deployment process
    is depicted in Figure 1.

- en: Xpress Insight allows Data Scientists to expose their model data and parameters
    as they build their models. Model data and parameters can then be made editable
    in Insight views and end-users can load the default data, change values of model
    data and parameters within their scenario to perform scenario analysis – all this
    without changing original data. To elaborate, an optimization or analytical model
    defines a set of input entities to receive scenario data and a set of result entities
    that will be populated with the optimization/analytical solution. The solution
    is the set of values representing the decisions identified by the optimization
    process or values suggested by analytical models along with other data synthesized
    from these values. In FICO Xpress Insight applications, a scenario contains the
    input data and results from the model. Business users will be able to modify/adjust/tweak
    input parameters to these analytical models to run what-if analysis and to run,
    clone, and compare what-if analyses across multiple scenarios, as shown in Figure
    2.

    deployment process, linking business users closely with the Data Science team,
    which enables business users to quickly evaluate, understand, and build trust
    in solutions that complement the way they think about their jobs.
