    "Why don’t we ask the tool to create our content fully?” Well, my personal experience
    would say it’s a bad idea. An uncurated, entirely Generated AI content actually
    has terrible quality and needs rework. That’s why I suggest we use the tool to
    help us create content, not replace the works.
