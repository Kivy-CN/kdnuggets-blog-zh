    expectations around advanced analytics and analyzing unstructured data grew, the
    role of “Data Scientist” appeared on the upward slope of the Gartner hype-cycle
    (see figure below).

    referenced in the Gartner graphic were starting to become apparent (i.e., Map
    Reduce and other distributed systems and Database Platform as a Service), and
    these start to appear on the downward slope of the same Gartner hype-cycle. These
    platforms didn’t magically provide the Data Scientists with the data they required,
    and it became clear that a lot of design and engineering was required to align
    these data-platforms with what the Data Scientists needed. Also, a huge amount
    of hype and expectation was developing around NoSQL databases, but this mainly
    focused on the needs of web-scale applications and agile development rather than
    the needs of data analysis.

    and the world of analytics and data science was pinning its hope on new data platform
    technologies such as** Apache Spark** and **Data Lakes**.

    control and automated test frameworks for merging changes and updates into releases
    will be required. This allows a team of people to collaborate on a complete product

    data-centric with more complex requirements in this area than the typical web
    application or transactional system. There are likely to be many bulk data aggregation
    requirements and complex data-feature engineering aspects, perhaps coupled with
    a high-volume data-streaming context.

    huge efficiencies at the data-layer. Also, understanding the context of the coding
    approach taken by the data scientist will help with translation into the production-code
    deployment. Conversely, being able to feed back the constraints of the code deployment
    platform and the data-processing platform to the data scientist in language that
    makes sense to the data scientist allows this to be factored into the analysis
    and modelling approach.

    inter-disciplinary silos and finally leads to the promised land of a machine learning
    application delivering value from the data provided by the data engineer and analysed
    by the data scientist.
