    Someone who knows the ins and outs of cloud services, operating systems, networking,

    that’ll be used in order to set it up properly.

    to easily provision and host their work on the cloud, without the need for specialised
    DevOps. You can then work within a Juptyer Notebook which is hosted on the server(s)
    specified by you and created by the system.
