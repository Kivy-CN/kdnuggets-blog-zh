    to do then? Have trouble concentrating on cat pictures? Are you one of those tech
    enthusiasts who wants a change for your convenience? Do you remember when you
    tried to convince your computer that the stop sign wasn't a yield sign when you
    wanted it to believe it was one? This is no longer a concern for fellow technology
    enthusiasts. To keep yourself engaged and entertained during the annotation and
    labeling process, there is a plethora of open-source tools that you can choose
    from. The use of image annotation tools has emerged as a superhero in the world
    of pixelated chaos. Using annotation tools, images can be identified in a fast
    and efficient way. Therefore, machines will become capable of understanding the
    world the same way as humans do, and computer programs will be able to make better
    decisions.

    of image annotation tools that are accurate, unbiased, and quick. From self-driving
    cars, medical, augmented reality, agriculture, and robotics, to e-commerce – the
    dependency on artificial intelligence is on the rise. Thus, the need for reliable
    and efficient image annotation sources is also increasing by leaps and bounds.
    In this article, we will draw a comparison between open-source and closed-source
    image annotation and cite real-life examples to come to a positive conclusion.

    and well worth the effort since it is the key to algorithms' success. Each image
    must be annotated so that machines can read it correctly (without errors or bias).
    In order to develop error-free AI models of high quality, the image annotation
    process must be accurate and precise in nature. As a result, the output we receive
    is unbiased, accurate, and precise to say the least.

    Open-source might only be a temporary pilot tool for those who care about scalability,
    innovation, and continuous development. On top of this, not all open-source tools
    are capable enough to produce high-quality outputs. The more precise the annotation
    and labeling of each image or video, the better off you will be if you are actually
    trying to transform traditional practices through AI.
