    analytics are all around these days. IBM projects that every day we generate 2.5
    quintillion bytes of data. This means that 90% of the data in the world has been
    created in the last two years. Gartner projects that by 2015, 85% of Fortune 500
    organizations will be unable to exploit big data for competitive advantage and
    about 4.4 million jobs will be created around big data.'

    are a strong indication of the ubiquity of big data and the need for analytical
    skills and resources, because as the data piles up, managing and analyzing these
    data resources in the best way become critical success factors in creating competitive
    advantage and strategic leverage. To address these challenges, companies are hiring
    data scientists. However, in the industry, there are strong misconceptions and
    disagreements about what constitutes a good data scientist. Here are the key characteristics
    of what makes up a good data scientist:'

- en: '![Good Programmer](../Images/a991e403ac08b72f7bfb3b9ee90f6673.png)As per definition,
    data scientists work with data. This involves plenty of activities such as sampling
    and pre-processing of data, model estimation and post-processing (e.g. sensitivity
    analysis, model deployment, back-testing, model validation). Although many user-friendly
    software tools are on the market nowadays to automate this, every analytical exercise
    requires tailored steps to tackle the specificities of a particular business problem.
    In order to successfully perform these steps, programming needs to be done. Hence,
    a good data scientist should possess sound programming skills in e.g. R, Python,
    SAS … The programming language itself is not that important as such, as long as
    he/she is familiar with the basic concepts of programming and knows how to use
    these to automate repetitive tasks or perform specific routines.'

    a data scientist should have a thorough background in statistics, machine learning
    and/or data mining. The distinction between these various disciplines is getting
    more and more blurred and is actually not that relevant. They all provide a set
    of quantitative techniques to analyze data and find business relevant patterns
    within a particular context (e.g. risk management, fraud detection, marketing
    analytics …). The data scientist should be aware of which technique can be applied
    when and how. He/she should not focus too much on the underlying mathematical
    (e.g. optimization) details but rather have a good understanding of what analytical
    problem a technique solves, and how its results should be interpreted. In this,
    training of engineers in computer science and business/industrial engineering
    should aim at an integrated, multidisciplinary view, with recent grads formed
    in both the use of the techniques, and with the business acumen necessary to bring
    new endeavors to fruition.'

  zh: '![可视化技能](../Images/e27e4b23b50ba2f4875243a2f5a419c5.png)显然，数据科学家应具备扎实的统计学、机器学习和/或数据挖掘背景。这些不同学科之间的区别越来越模糊，实际上并不那么重要。它们都提供了一套定量技术来分析数据，并在特定背景下（如风险管理、欺诈检测、市场分析等）发现与业务相关的模式。数据科学家应该了解何时以及如何应用哪种技术。他/她不应过于关注底层数学（如优化）细节，而应对某项技术解决的分析问题以及其结果的解释有良好的理解。在这方面，计算机科学和商业/工业工程的工程师培训应致力于综合的、多学科的视角，培养既能运用技术又具备将新项目实现的商业头脑的近期毕业生。'
- en: 'Also important in this context is to spend enough time validating the analytical
    results obtained so as to avoid situations often referred to as data massage and/or
    data torture whereby data is (intentionally) misrepresented and/or too much focus
    is spent discussing spurious correlations. When selecting the optimal quantitative
    technique, the data scientist should take into account the specificities of the
    business problem. Typical requirements for analytical models are: action-ability
    (to what extent is the analytical model solving the business problem?), performance
    (what is the statistical performance of the analytical model?), interpret-ability
    (can the analytical model be easily explained to decision makers?), operational
    efficiency (how much efforts are needed to setup, evaluate and monitor the analytical
    model?), regulatory compliance (is the model in line with regulation?) and economical
    cost (what is the cost of setting up, running and maintaining the model?). Based
    upon a combination of these requirements, the data scientist should be capable
    of selecting the best analytical technique to solve the business problem.'

  zh: 在这种情况下，另一个重要的方面是花足够的时间来验证所获得的分析结果，以避免被称为数据修饰和/或数据折磨的情况，其中数据被（故意）误表示和/或过多关注于讨论虚假的相关性。在选择最佳的定量技术时，数据科学家应考虑业务问题的具体性。分析模型的典型要求包括：可操作性（分析模型在多大程度上解决了业务问题？），性能（分析模型的统计表现如何？），可解释性（分析模型是否容易向决策者解释？），操作效率（建立、评估和监控分析模型需要多少努力？），合规性（模型是否符合规定？）以及经济成本（建立、运行和维护模型的成本是多少？）。基于这些要求的综合考虑，数据科学家应能够选择最佳的分析技术来解决业务问题。

- en: Like it or not, but analytics is a technical exercise. At this moment, there
    is a huge gap between the analytical models and the business users. To bridge
    this gap, communication and ![Quantitative Skills](../Images/53fab9fe905e223d7621120055f93d5c.png)visualization
    facilities are key! Hence, a data scientist should know how to represent analytical
    models and their accompanying statistics and reports in user-friendly ways using
    e.g. traffic light approaches, OLAP (on-line analytical processing) facilities,
    If-then business rules, … He/she should be capable of communicating the right
    amount of information without getting lost into complex (e.g. statistical) details
    which will inhibit a model’s successful deployment. By doing so, business users
    will better understand the characteristics and behavior in their (big) data which
    will improve their attitude towards and acceptance of the resulting analytical
    models. Educational institutions must learn to balance, since it is known that
    many academic degrees prepare students that are skewed to either too much analytical
    or too much practical knowledge.

    needs creativity on at least two levels. First, on a technical level, it is important
    to be creative with regard to feature selection, data transformation and cleaning.
    These steps of the standard knowledge discovery process have to be adapted to
    each particular application and often the “right guess” could make a big difference.
    Second, big data and analytics is a fast evolving field! New problems, technologies
    and corresponding challenges pop up on an ongoing basis. It is important that
    a data scientist keeps up with these new technologies and has enough creativity
    to see how they can create new business opportunities.'
