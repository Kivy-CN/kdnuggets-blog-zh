    working environment. Even for me, it’s always the first place I go to for any
    data science experiment and workflow.

    can be executed independently in each cell. At the same time, the author could
    explain each cell. This distinction allows the notebook to be reused by others
    and become a project template.

    project on Jupyter Notebook. So, what are these Jupyter Notebook templates? Let’s
    get into them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first template that we discuss is not necessarily a complete code project
    that we can fill in already. The template we would discuss is not only the Jupyter
    Notebook but also complete projects that support the Jupyter Notebook. What we
    would have is the [Python data science projects by AWS](https://github.com/aws-samples/python-data-science-template).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This template creates a complete data science project structure that is ready
    to be used for your actual project. Using [Cookiecutter CLI](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter),
    you can generate the directory structure of the data science projects, which is
    similar to the structure below.

- en: The next Jupyter Notebook template we will discuss is the one by [Coen Meintjes](https://github.com/CoenMeintjes/data_science_notebook_templates/tree/main).
    It is a basic Jupyter Notebook collection from Data Exploration to Model Evaluation.
    It’s not a project-specific kind of template; in fact, it mostly consists of the
    essential code, nothing more. But I would say it is good. Why is that?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s a basic template that everyone can use for different kinds of projects
    with little tweaks. You can use this Jupyter Notebook template to develop any
    project idea. Moreover, the templates here explain in depth many of the processes
    in the notebook, so any beginner or professional could benefit from them.

    Jupyter Notebook templates by Yusuf Cinarci](https://github.com/SUKHMAN-SINGH-1612/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main).
    In these templates, you can use them to develop simple projects for your portfolio
    or any business needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many project templates you can choose from. You can choose from simple
    Salary Data Exploration with Python to the development of a Fake News Detection
    and Movie Recommendation System. The notebook is perfect for you who want to kickstart
    your projects easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I like about the Yusuf Cinarci template collections is that they are not
    overly complicated, so beginners can start their projects when they learn about
    data science. However, many of the projects are for beginners, so they might lack
    data science projects if you are looking for one.

    Science Projects Jupyter Notebook template by Sukman Singh](https://github.com/SUKHMAN-SINGH-1612/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main)
    could be the one for you. It’s perfect for those who want to develop prediction
    models easily but need inspiration for their ideas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The template collection contains many data science project templates, including
    customer churn prediction, loan approval prediction, and claim fraud projects.
    These are standard business projects that you can use to enrich your data project
    portfolio.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The project might seem one-dimensional, but you can extend the project as well.
    It’s a template that you can use to develop your project and use another dataset
    that you feel is appropriate for your business problem.

    Awesome Notebook is a project by Jupyter Naas to create the largest catalogue
    of production-ready Jupyter Notebook templates. There is an abundance of free
    Jupyter Notebook templates from which you can choose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    use cases. From AI development to analysing business funnels to YouTube video
    download, there are so many templates you can choose from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the templates require you to understand how to work as a data scientist,
    so learning how to use Python as a data scientist would help you use these templates.
    Once you understand what you need, this template collection will help your work.
