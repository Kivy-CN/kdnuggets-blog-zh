- en: It is no doubt that the sub-field of machine learning / artificial intelligence
    has increasingly gained more popularity in the past couple of years. As Big Data
    is the hottest trend in the tech industry at the moment, machine learning is incredibly
    powerful to make predictions or calculated suggestions based on large amounts
    of data.

    my first introduction is when I took an Artificial Intelligence class when I was
    studying abroad in Copenhagen.

    *Artificial Intelligence — A Modern Approach*](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597),
    in which we covered major topics including intelligent agents, problem-solving
    by searching, adversarial search, probability theory, multi-agent systems, social
    AI, philosophy/ethics/future of AI.

    a Machine Learning conference with a lot of well-known professionals in the field.

    Least squares is a method for performing linear regression. You can think of linear
    regression as the task of fitting a straight line through a set of points. There
    are multiple possible strategies to do this, and “ordinary least squares” strategy
    go like this — You can draw a line, and then for each of the data points, measure
    the vertical distance between the point and the line, and add these up; the fitted
    line would be the one where this sum of distances is as small as possible.

    categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating
    probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative logistic distribution.

    in N dimensional place, SVM generates a (N — 1) dimensional hyperplane to separate
    those points into 2 groups. Say you have some points of 2 types in a paper which
    are linearly separable. SVM will find a straight line which separates those points
    into 2 types and situated as far as possible from all those points.
