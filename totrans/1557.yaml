    they cannot afford not to use data science. Within the telecom industry data science
    applications are widely used to streamline the operations, to maximize profits,
    to build effective marketing and business strategies, to visualize data, to perform
    data transfer and for many other cases. Key activities of the companies working
    in the telecommunication sector are strongly related to data transfer, exchange,
    and import. The amounts of data passing through various communication channels
    are getting larger every minute. Therefore, old techniques and methods are no
    longer relevant.

- en: Telecommunication industry being the one attracting almost the most significant
    number of users every day is a vast field for fraudulent activity. The most widespread
    cases of fraud in the telecom area are illegal access, authorization, theft or
    fake profiles, cloning, behavioral fraud, etc. Fraud has a direct influence on
    the relationship established between the company and the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, fraud detection systems, tools, and techniques found wide usage.
    By applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms to an immense amount of customer
    and operator data to spot the characteristics of normal traffic you can prevent
    fraud. The algorithms define the anomalies and with the help of data visualization
    techniques present them as alerts to the analysts in real time. The efficiency
    of this technique is very high because it allows to provide an almost real-time
    response to the suspicious activity.

    insights to become faster, better and make data-driven decisions. Knowledge of
    customer preferences and needs gives a better understanding of the customer. Predictive
    analytics uses historical data to build forecasts. The better is the quality of
    the data and the longer they are historically, the better is predictability.

    market and target the content according to each group. This golden rule is relevant
    to the various areas of business. Speaking about telecommunication, there are
    four segmentation schemes of primary importance: customer value segmentation,
    customer behaviour segmentation, customer lifecycle segmentation, and customer
    migration segmentation.'

    a lot of effort as well. Accurate diagnosis of the customer's behavior and enabling
    alerts highlight the customers at a risk defecting. Smart data platforms can bring
    together customer transactions data and data from real-time communication streams
    to disclose the insights concerning customers feelings about the services. This
    allows immediate addressing the satisfaction-related issues and churn prevention.

- en: Customers tend to search for better and cheaper services, therefore, it is important
    for the telecommunication companies to measure, manage and predict the customer
    lifetime value (CLV). Failing to predict this value may result in profit loss.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Customer lifetime value is a discounted value of all the future profits and
    revenues generated by the customer. The CLV model is concentrated on customer
    purchasing behavior, activity, services utilized, and average customer value.
    Smart solutions process real-time insights distinguishing between profitable,
    nearly profitable, and unprofitable segments of customers predicting future cash
    flows.

    and internal channels as a guarantee of smooth functioning of the operations.
    Network management and optimization gives an opportunity to define the score points
    in operations to identify the root causes of these complications. Looking into
    historical data and predicting possible future problems or, on the contrary, beneficial
    scenarios is a great benefit for the telecom providers.

    starting from the stage of concept development till ongoing lifecycle management
    and maintenance. Ensuring the high-quality performance of the product according
    to the customer’s requirements is impossible without applying smart data solutions.
    Data-driven product development process should take into consideration not only
    customer needs but the results of digital analytics implementation, internal feedbacks,
    and marketing intelligence.

    sphere is among these aspects. Ignoring the enormous data sets concerning customers
    preferences would become a significant loss for the telecom. Prediction of the

    and making a prediction about possible future needs of the product or service.
    Most popular approaches here are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Collaborative filtering relies on the analysis of data on user's behavior or
    preferences and predicting what they will like by their similarity to others.
    The critical assumption of the model is that people with similar profiles may
    have similar needs and make similar choices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    between the customer profile and the items the customer chooses. Thus, the algorithm
    recommends the items and services similar to those previously purchased.

    This analysis allows assessment of the customer positive or negative reaction
    to the service or product. Analysis of the aggregated data also allows revealing
    recent trends and reacting to the customers’ problematic issues in real-time.
    Customer sentiments analysis largely relies on text analysis techniques. Modern

    with significant data streams for years. Due to rapid development of the internet
    and the evolving of 3G, 4G, and even 5G connections, telecommunication companies
    face the challenge of the constantly changing customer requirements. The subscribers
    are becoming more and more demanding, and the traffic gets more active every day.

    solutions are specially tailored to continuously ingest, analyze and correlate
    data gained from multiple sources and generate response action in real-time mode.
    Real-time analytics combines the data related to customer profiles, network, location,
    traffic, and usage to create a 360-degree user-centric view of the product or
    service. It also captures and analyzes the interaction and communication between
    the customers.
