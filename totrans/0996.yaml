    aid machine learning, optimize AI-driven computers, and predict future outcomes
    with incredible accuracy. Our modern age remains defined by continuous technological
    breakthroughs fueled by data. Raw data is the guiding post for new technology
    and helps keep new developments in line with reality and everyday functionality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data exists all around us, but collecting and organizing data for a specific
    project can sometimes be overwhelming. Here are the top five common sources for
    raw data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Publicly available data
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll start with the most obvious source of data – public data, which can be
    found in government records or other public databases such as Facebook, LinkedIn,
    or Google. Public data is any information out in the open, such as newspaper stories,
    city census information, or voter registration lists. As our society continues
    to incorporate more technology into everyday life, data gathered about people
    will only continue to grow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, a [recent study showed](https://phys.org/news/2022-07-machine-learning-algorithm-racial-makeup-neighborhoods.html)
    that demographic changes in a neighborhood can be accurately predicted by information
    gathered through the U.S. Census Bureau, potentially removing the need for labor-intensive
    door-to-door census surveys. While this is an innocuous example, other technical
    improvements in gathering public data, such as facial recognition technology,
    remain controversial modes of collecting data and are thus rarely used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whether you are raking through Twitter as part of sentiment analysis or using
    local demographic statistics to build a preliminary data model, public data can
    be a helpful foundation to build upon. While it is a good starting point for your
    research or project, it also makes your data models easier to replicate. Statistics
    show that [81% of retailers](https://www.invoca.com/blog/retail-marketing-statistics)
    collect data in large quantities to help with their marketing and development.

- en: Using public data can make your models more generic, but it can result in a
    level of transparency that can add to your project. For example, [cryptocurrencies
    such as Bitcoin](https://cryptowallet.com/academy/how-to-buy-crypto-sweden/) are
    traded on a public blockchain that is permissionless and accessible by everyone,
    yet transactions remain very secure.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that you have a model based on publicly available data, it is time to finetune
    it with more specific data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best data to use for machine learning or to develop an artificially intelligent
    program is data that is specific to your program or type of user. For example,
    autonomous cars continuously [gather data from their drivers](/2022/03/5-applications-computer-vision.html)
    to enhance their ability to drive autonomously. Conversational AI chatbots rely
    on data inputs and user behavior to enhance their ability to reply to requests
    and answer questions accurately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an extremely relevant way of gathering data because it is highly specified.
    For example, if you were developing an AI-powered search database for a company
    that works in finance, you could use publicly available financial data to begin
    the foundational construction of your database. However, to truly hone the database
    so that it is custom-made for the types of questions and inquiries that arise
    in the atmosphere of a finance department, that software would need to rely on
    the interactions it has with its users to learn. That’s why AI-powered software
    may start off clunky or irrelevant and grow much more accurate and efficient with
    frequent use.

- en: Another method of collecting data comes from human entry. In this method, trained
    operators or engineers work on the design or application of a program while simultaneously
    collecting data. Supervising and controlling the system manually as it is operating,
    developers can work on the prototype for their new model [while also collecting](/2019/07/7-tips-dealing-small-data.html)
    real-world data. A system may start off being 70% controlled by an operator and
    30% autonomous, but once enough data is gathered, and artificial intelligence
    is bolstered, the system may progress to being 95% autonomous as it “learns” how
    to behave.

    autonomous. The cars start with minimal self-driving features – such as the ability
    to detect a car ahead of it and break, drive straight to stay within a lane, or
    maintain a certain speed. These features are powered using cameras and sensors,
    which also play an important role in gathering data about driving behaviors, neighborhoods,
    and common roadblocks.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A more old-fashioned form of data collection, “brute force” data acquisition
    is still an effective method. This is when data is collected purposefully rather
    than picked up from publicly available data or as part of the testing or development
    of your product. For example, a city census taker might go door-to-door [verifying
    information](/2021/03/data-validation-data-verification-dictionary-machine-learning.html)
    about citizens that live there. Similarly, a surveying vehicle can be tasked with
    driving around a neighborhood to gather images with the purpose of creating an
    HD map.

    and using the data comes later – without humans or artificial intelligence interference
    to make that data meaningful. While this method is time-consuming and labor-intensive,
    this type of hard-won data can be difficult for competitors to replicate.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An increasingly popular way for companies to gain access to high-quality data
    is to simply purchase data sets from a reputable company. When purchasing data
    for use in your model, you don’t have control over the type or quality of data
    you receive, and there is always the possibility that it will be outdated or irrelevant
    to your project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, it is a quick and easy way to get the data you need to begin training
    your program. Companies who obtain data with this method should research the reputation
    of the company they are buying from, the source of the data, and how it was collected
    to confirm that it is relevant for their purposes before purchasing.
