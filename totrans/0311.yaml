- en: If you’re like me and you’re already at an age where going back to university
    is not an option or you’re ready to transition careers but need guidance - you’ve
    landed on the right page. I was working full-time and had no option but to take
    a course that was flexible because I had to keep a roof over my head. University
    was completely out of the picture. I needed a course that allowed me to gain the
    skills and knowledge without having to compromise finances and too much time.

- en: Before taking the certification, I had already taken a BootCamp 2 years before.
    When I went into the tech industry and landed my first junior data scientist job
    I realized that there were elements of data science that the bootcamp didn’t teach
    me. I would go around and around in circles trying to figure it out before I realized
    I had to go back and truly study before continuing my data science journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that is what I did. I decided to take Google's Data Analytics Certification
    and set myself to complete it in 2 months.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the journey starts and the first thing I would like to say. The content -
    amazing! The process - smooth! The walkthrough - impeccable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you were like me and felt as if you needed a touch-up on your data analysis
    or data science learning or you’re new to the data world and you need guidance
    - this course did exactly that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, there is a lot of learning material but all of the material was imperative
    to the learning journey and helped in my understanding. After each section, multiple
    choice questions helped me understand each section rather than just a load of
    questions at the end of each module.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it came to doing the end-of-section multiple choice and module tests -
    I was smashing it. Yes, my previous boot camp knowledge helped me here and there,
    but a few years out of the data science game - the content was a godsend to help
    me gain this certification.

- en: So good that I have recommended it to a few family and friends who have no technical
    experience and have come back with great feedback saying the structure and process
    were beginner-friendly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My overall opinion and feedback on the certification is that I would highly
    recommend it to those who are new to the tech industry due to its course structure
    but also for those who want to touch up on their existing knowledge to make sure
    they’ve really got it!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember, this certification is aimed at beginners which means your data science
    learning journey should not stop here. Continuously learning new skills and tools
    will help you become a successful data scientist!

    and preferred another way of learning. However, if you are someone who needs guidance
    and likes to take baby steps - this certification is highly recommended!
