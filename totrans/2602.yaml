- en: Supervised Machine Learning requires labeled training data, and large ML systems
    need large amounts of training data. Labeling training data is resource intensive,
    and while techniques such as crowd sourcing and web scraping can help, they can
    be error-prone, adding ‘label noise’ to training sets.

    well. For example, a 2018 MIT/Cornell University [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10694)
    tested the accuracy of ML image classification systems trained with various levels
    of label noise. They found that the ML systems could maintain good performance
    with high levels of label noise under the following conditions:'

    of the image classification task. For example, a four-layer convolutional neural
    network (CNN) was sufficient for a hand-written character benchmark, but an 18-layer
    residual network was needed to perform well on a general object recognition benchmark.

    labeled examples, even if most of the training data is mislabeled. With enough
    good training samples, the ML system can learn accurate classification by finding
    the ‘signal’ buried in the label noise.

    noise. The mislabeled samples were added to the training sets in a way that was
    random enough to not create strong patterns that would override the ‘signal’ represented
    by the properly labeled samples.

    the effect of mislabeled training data on ML systems used to classify rubble from
    the 2011 New Zealand earthquake. They had noticed that in this type of remote
    sensing application, label noise does not follow the sort of random patterns that
    ML systems were able to tolerate in the MIT/Cornell study. The labeling mistakes
    they observed were mainly due to inaccurate geospatial delineation, caused by
    lack of training (e.g., misunderstanding what to include as rubble) or inadequate
    tools (e.g., a coarsely drawn polygon including undamaged sidewalks as part of
    rubble).

- en: The researchers simulated training data sets with the sort of geospatial labeling
    noise they had observed, and also with random labeling noise. They compared the
    performance of ML classification on these two data sets and found that geospatial
    mislabeling degraded classification performance about five times more than random
    mislabeling.

- en: Not all training data labeling errors have the same impact on ML system performance.
    If your labeling errors are mostly random in nature, they will be less harmful
    to your ML system. The errors will not create a large enough ‘signal’ to send
    training in the wrong direction.

    of labeling rules, they can be very harmful to your ML system. The system will
    learn to recognize the patterns created by this erroneous data as if it were correctly
    labeled.
