    was on the top of the world — I got a job in my dream field, my career track is
    set, I will just keep my head down and work hard, what could go wrong? Well, there
    were a couple of things… For the following year as a data scientist, there were
    several mistakes that I’m glad I caught myself making early in my career. This
    way, I had time to reflect and course-correct before it was too late. After a
    while, I realized that these mistakes are quite common. In fact, I have observed
    a lot of DS around me still making these mistakes, unaware that they can hurt
    their data career in the long run.

    rules and orders, especially in school. You will be the top student if you follow
    the textbook and practice exams and just put in the hard work. A lot of people
    seem to carry this “foot soldier” mindset into their working environment. In my
    opinion, this is the exact mindset that’s hindering a lot of data scientists from
    maximizing their impact and standing out from their peers. I have observed a lot
    of DS, especially junior ones, think they have nothing to contribute to the decision-making
    process and would rather retreat to the background and passively implement decisions
    made for them. This kicks off a vicious cycle — the less you contribute to those
    discussions, the less likely stakeholders will involve you in future meetings,
    and the less opportunity you will get to contribute in the future.

- en: Let me give you a concrete example of the difference between a foot soldier
    and a thought partner in the case of model development. In the data collection
    and feature brainstorming meetings, the old me used to passively take notes on
    stakeholders’ suggestions so I can implement them “perfectly” later on. When someone
    proposed a feature that I knew we didn’t have data for, I would not say anything
    based on the assumption that they are more senior and they must know something
    that I overlooked. But guess what, they didn’t. I would later face the situation
    that 50% of the features we brainstormed would require additional data collection
    that would put our project deadline at risk. As a result, I often found myself
    in the undesirable position of the bad-news-bearing messenger in the end. Striving
    to be a thought partner nowadays, I involve myself early in the conversation and
    leverage my unique position as the person that’s closest to the data. This way,
    I can manage the expectations of stakeholders early on and make suggestions to
    help the team move forward.

    marketing & sales data or do the geospatial analysis? You may have noticed that
    I have been using the term DS so far in this article as a general term for a lot
    of [data-related career paths](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-pick-the-right-career-in-the-data-world-1cec8a084767) (e.g.,
    data engineer, data scientist, data analyst, etc.). That’s because the lines are
    so blurred between these titles in the data world these days, especially in smaller
    companies. I have observed a lot of data scientists see themselves as ONLY data
    scientists building models and don’t pay attention to any business aspects or
    data engineers who only focus on data pipelining and don’t want to know anything
    about the modeling that’s going on in the company.

    able to understand the processes of other data roles. This comes in especially
    handy if you want to work in an early stage or growth stage startup, where functions
    might not be as specialized yet, and you are expected to be flexible and cover
    a variety of data-related responsibilities. Even if you are in a clearly defined
    job profile, as you get more experience over time, you might discover that you
    are interested in transitioning into a different type of data role. This pivot
    will be much easier if you did not pigeonhole yourself and your skillset into
    the narrow focus of one specific role.

    always at play.

    I wrote about how business impact and interpretability sometimes are more important
    than the extra several percentage points of your model’s accuracy. Sometimes maybe
    an assumptions-driven Excel model makes more sense than a multi-layered neural
    net. In those cases, don’t over-flex your analytical muscle and make your approach
    overkill. Instead, flex your business muscle and be the DS who also has business
    acumen.

    would request an ML model because it’s a popular concept, and they have unrealistic

    expectations and help them find better and simpler ways to achieve their goals.

    I wrote about how the lives of data scientists can be horrible and unproductive
    if the company doesn’t have a great data culture. In fact, I have heard a lot
    of DS complaining about unproductive ad hoc data requests that should be easily
    handled by stakeholders in a self-sufficient fashion (for example, changing an
    aggregation from monthly to daily in Looker, which literally consists of two clicks).
    Don’t think changing that culture is someone else’s job. If you want to see changes,
    make them. After all, who is better positioned to build the data culture and educate
    stakeholders about data than data scientists themselves? Helping to build up the
    data culture in the company will make your life a lot easier down the road as
    well as your stakeholders.
