- en: Data scientists and data analysts are two of the most desirable and highest-paid
    professions in 2022\. Data-driven insights are continuing to grow as more and
    more data becomes available. Data professionals who can sift through, analyze,
    and interpret these massive amounts of information are key today. Although both
    data analysts and data scientists handle data, it can sometimes be unclear what
    the difference is. One of the primary differences lies in what they do with the
    data they process.

    Most often, data analysts leverage tools like SQL, R, Python, and other programming
    languages. They also use [data visualization software](/software/visualization.html)
    and statistical analysis.
  prefs: []

- en: Data scientists, in contrast, work with the unknown and use more advanced data
    analysis techniques to make predictions about the future. Data scientists build
    automated machine learning algorithms and develop predictive modeling techniques
    that can handle both structured and unstructured data. Usually, this role is considered
    a more advanced version of the data analyst. This isn’t all there is to it, though.

- en: Before we jump into data analysts and data scientists, it’s important to understand
    some key terms. There’s no universally accepted definition of what “data science”
    means, but Cassie Kozyrkov, head of Decision Intelligence at Google, says, “Data
    Science is the discipline of making data useful.”
  prefs: []

- en: Another important term to understand is [data mining](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-mining)
    and descriptive analytics. It is the process of identifying patterns in data and
    formulating hypotheses about the processes that cause those patterns. This step
    in the data process is focused on searching through data to find trends.

    it. The data sets they work with tend to be large, unstructured, and require abstract
    analysis to find insights from the data.

    scientists and put it to use. They receive known data sets with insights and then
    look for new trends in that data. Since the data is more structured, data analysts
    can create reports to answer specific business questions and communicate their
    findings to a non-technical audience.
