- en: prython is a novel IDE that allows you to code in R or Python (you can even
    use both within the same project) by connecting panels in a canvas. It allows
    you to organise your code, perform experiments that run with one click, and visualise
    your plots+dataframes next to the panel that created them. Tired of remembering
    which lines need to commented out to test something? Or do you just want to organise
    your code better? Currently available for Windows, and runs with your local R/Python
    kernels.

    environments, including no-code features for input and output flow management,
    data visualizations, spinning up context consoles at various spots within the
    project flow, mixed dataframe inspection, and more.

- en: prython is based on the notion of panels which can be connected to one another
    on a canvas, with each panel running Python or R code. Panels have connections,
    both input and output, and these interconnections can be configured and reconfigured
    as needed. Panels can run independently, or in tandem with the panels which come
    before or after it. Why bother with panels at all?

- en: Data professionals need to experiment with their data, build tons of plots,
    and separate the code into different areas. They rarely want to have a single
    linear script that runs from start to end. This almost inevitably leads to very
    messy scripts, unclear outputs, multiplicity of confusing plots, and users needing
    to remember what needs to be commented out to test something. No other IDE is
    well suited for this.

- en: The days of arguing about which of these are the one language to rule them all
    are done, but that doesn't mean that either one is the "winner." Python and R
    are 2 tools that can be used to accomplish your data science or data analysis
    goals, and setting your goals based on the tools you are using is counterproductive.
    So use either — or both — and have a look at prython to see if its unique approach
    to a data science-centric IDE can make you more productive. After all, getting
    out of the way and allowing you to be productive is what your tools are *supposed*
    to do.
