    solve business problems. *“A good data scientist in my mind is the person that
    takes the science part in data science very seriously; a person who is able to
    find problems and solve them using statistics, machine learning, and distributed
    computing.”* said Amir Hajian, Director of Research at Thomson Reuters Labs. In
    other words, data scientists are people who can *“reason through data using inferential
    reasoning, think in terms of probabilities, be scientific and systematic, and
    make data work at scale using software engineering best practices,”* said Baiju
    Devani, Vice President of Analytics at Aviva. He added that It is important to
    recognize that, *“there is no deterministic path to the problems you're solving
    or the solutions you find, so you have to be ok with fuzziness,”* He also states
    that you need to, “have that experimental mindset that allows you to work with
    vague problem and solution definitions.” In some sense, the best data scientists
    are people with “*good statistical knowledge, programming and technical skills,
    and industry experience*” according to  Lindsay Farber, Senior Data Scientist
    at MoneyKey.

    Devani说。他还补充说，重要的是要认识到，*“你所解决的问题或找到的解决方案没有确定的路径，因此你必须接受模糊性，”* 他说，您还需要“拥有那种实验性的思维方式，使您能够处理模糊的问题和解决方案定义。”
    从某种意义上说，Lindsay Farber，MoneyKey的高级数据科学家认为，最好的数据科学家是具有“*良好的统计知识、编程和技术技能以及行业经验*”的人。
- en: Ozge Yeloglu, Chief Data Scientist at Microsoft Canada also reminds us that
    in business there is a need “*to step back and get educated about what data science
    really is. It is the use of data to address business problems which sometimes
    means there is no need to use machine learning or artificial intelligence.*” Part
    of the misunderstandings that exists around data science originate from the hype
    that exists. Every business is in rush to get into data science without taking
    the time to understand why and how. Big companies are in a fierce competition
    to hire as many data scientists as they can without taking the foundational steps
    needed. “*If you have 100-200 data scientists (compared to say Facebook who has
    500-600 data scientists), you are in the wrong business*”, said Baiju Devani.
    He added “*while these organizations have big problems to solve through data science
    or machine learning, they have not thought about operationalization to bring those
    solutions at scale.*” On the other hand, there are startups who are too eager
    to solve everything with machine learning without thinking about the proper scale
    of the problems. “*If you are a startup with a thousand clients, you should not
    be doing sentiment analysis instead of calling and talking to every one of your
    clients,*” said Baiju Devani. Practitioners are also rushing into becoming data
    scientists without understanding what it means. “*Everyone who has taken a few
    online courses thinks they have transitioned without putting nearly enough time
    and effort into it,*” said Ozge Yeloglu.

  zh: 微软加拿大首席数据科学家 Ozge Yeloglu 还提醒我们，在商业中需要**“退后一步，了解数据科学真正是什么。它是利用数据来解决商业问题，这有时意味着没有必要使用机器学习或人工智能。”**
    关于数据科学的部分误解源于存在的炒作。每个企业都急于进入数据科学，而没有花时间了解为什么以及如何做。大公司在激烈竞争中争取雇佣尽可能多的数据科学家，而没有采取必要的基础步骤。**“如果你有100-200名数据科学家（相比之下，比如
    Facebook 有500-600名数据科学家），那么你可能在错误的行业中，”** Baiju Devani 说。他补充说**“虽然这些组织有很大的问题需要通过数据科学或机器学习来解决，但他们没有考虑如何将这些解决方案规模化。”**
    另一方面，一些初创公司过于急于通过机器学习解决所有问题，而没有考虑问题的适当规模。**“如果你是一个拥有一千个客户的初创公司，你不应该进行情感分析，而是应该给每个客户打电话并与他们交谈，”**
    Baiju Devani 说。从业者也在急于成为数据科学家，而没有真正理解这意味着什么。**“每一个参加过几门在线课程的人都认为自己已经转行了，而实际上他们几乎没有投入足够的时间和精力，”**
    Ozge Yeloglu 说。
- en: The hype is not completely unjustified, however. There has been quite a few
    interesting business use cases that have been creating an excitement in the industry.
    “*I really feel happy when our clients come to us with a real data business problem
    and we can help them with our resources while leveraging their domain knowledge;
    that makes me optimistic that the hype can get us to the reality sooner than later,*”
    said Ozge Yeloglu. “*Organizations want to find this new way of of doing business
    in a new direction that was not possible before,*” said Amir Hajian. He added
    that practitioners want to be data scientists because “*they want jobs that do
    not end, and are not repeating the same thing over and over again every day.*”
    He said “*it is the perfect time for people who are not computer scientists but
    want to get into the industry and do something good.*” This is, afterall, a field
    that is not as rigid; “*it is changing and it's finding its own way and it's evolving
    so you have to be ready for that and you have to find your favorite thing and
    your niche and and you have to keep going.*”

  zh: 然而，这种炒作并非完全毫无理由。确实有一些有趣的商业用例在业内引起了兴奋。**“当我们的客户带着真正的数据业务问题找上我们，而我们可以利用我们的资源并结合他们的领域知识来帮助他们时，我真的感到非常高兴；这让我乐观地认为，炒作可以让我们比预期更快地实现现实，”**
    Ozge Yeloglu 说。**“组织希望找到一种新的商业方式，朝着以前不可能的方向发展，”** Amir Hajian 说。他补充说，从业者想成为数据科学家，因为**“他们希望找到那些不会结束的工作，并且不是每天重复同样的事情。”**
    他还表示**“现在正是那些不是计算机科学家但希望进入这个行业并做一些有意义的事情的人的最佳时机。”** 毕竟，这是一个不那么刻板的领域；**“它在变化，它在找到自己的道路，并且在不断发展，所以你必须为此做好准备，你必须找到你喜欢的东西和你的细分领域，并且不断前进。”**
- en: 'Given all the uncertainty that exists, there are few things that can be done
    to increase the likelihood of success as a data-driven business. One of the most
    important steps is to “*ask what the objective is and why you need data science,
    and you need to keep asking why until you get a good answer to do that and then
    the rest falls into place,*” said Baiju Devani. Next step is to create an efficient
    data science team. The core of the team should come from the business itself,
    rather than any new hires. “*If you can find that one person in your team who
    is a domain expert already and understands the data and most likely is already
    doing traditional Business Intelligence, and if they want to become the data scientist,
    let them be and invest in them,*” said Ozge Yeloglu. Once that core is formed
    and depending on the priority, timeframe, and the complexity of the problem you
    might end up hiring people with various skill sets. Most of the time the best
    solution is to have a data engineer to build the infrastructure and then a data
    scientist on top of it in addition to the business domain experts. In fact, “*for
    every data scientists there are other roles that you need: data visualization
    experts, developers, and UI/UX designers,*” said Amir Hajian.'

  zh: 鉴于存在的所有不确定性，有些事情可以做以增加作为数据驱动业务成功的可能性。**Baiju Devani**表示，其中一个最重要的步骤是：“*问一下目标是什么，为什么需要数据科学，你需要不断问为什么，直到得到一个好的答案，然后其他的就自然会就位，*”
    下一步是建立一个高效的数据科学团队。团队的核心应该来自于业务本身，而不是任何新员工。**Ozge Yeloglu**说：“*如果你能找到团队中已经是领域专家并理解数据的人，并且他们很可能已经在做传统的商业智能工作，如果他们想成为数据科学家，就让他们去做，并对他们进行投资，*”
    一旦形成了核心团队，根据优先级、时间框架和问题的复杂性，你可能会雇佣具有各种技能的人。大多数时候，最佳解决方案是让数据工程师来构建基础设施，然后在其上再加一个数据科学家，以及业务领域专家。事实上，**Amir
    Hajian**指出：“*每个数据科学家都需要其他角色：数据可视化专家、开发人员和UI/UX设计师，*”
- en: 'The composition and culture of a data team is indeed very important. That diversity
    of backgrounds and mentalities provides the right ingredient to be successful.
    “*We''ve talked a lot about data science being a science but I think it''s as
    much artistic and requires a lot of creativity and it is clear from research that
    diversity leads to creativity,*” said Baiju Devani. “*At my company I had to work
    with other data scientists in my team to come up with better answers,*” said Lindsay
    Farber. “*It is  hard work that is beyond coming up with an algorithm: you have
    to clean the data, talk to the customer, build the whole model and then present
    it to the stakeholders, and be patient and come up with different ways of putting
    it in front of the customer and explaining it to them; that''s where you see that
    people who have different technical backgrounds can make a huge impact because
    they are looking at things differently and and they have the expertise,*” said
    Amir Hajian.This is especially important in terms of social, gender and racial
    diversity for companies in public sector or social innovation. “*One story that
    I heard recently was about one group that built a model for detecting a disease
    and it worked great in training, but failed when tested in real life; their training
    data was all for white Caucasian and it was failing on all Latino population and

    Farber**说：“*在我的公司，我必须与团队中的其他数据科学家合作，以提出更好的答案，*”**Amir Hajian**补充道：“*这是一项超越算法的艰巨工作：你必须清理数据，与客户沟通，构建整个模型，然后向利益相关者展示，并且要耐心，想出不同的方法来呈现给客户并解释给他们；这就是为什么拥有不同技术背景的人能够产生巨大影响，因为他们以不同的方式看待问题，并且具备专业知识，*”**Ozge

- en: There are many nuances in creating a data science team that taking it loosely
    will certainly lead into failure. So far, it should be clear how different technical
    roles and expertise along with soft skills intertwine to create a team that can
    achieve great objectives in data science. Selecting individuals to join such a
    team is a great challenge and needs to be done with care. “*To me team culture
    is one of the biggest things, so I look for the fit for my team and for our clients.
    In my team data scientists are technical people with very high communication skills
    who can talk with people ranging from data scientists to VPs and CIOs. A typical
    question that I ask in interviews is a very open-ended case study and see if the
    candidate is able to ask the right questions, and figure out what the right technical
    solution is, and I observe that thought process end to end.*” said Ozge Yeloglu.
    She added “*obviously, technical skill is important but as long as they know Python
    or R, I trust that they're gonna keep learning and improving. This is important
    because data science is one of those areas that keeps growing, so you can't really
    stay static.*” Another important thing that hiring managers should look into in
    interviews is the ability of the candidate to brainstorm and work with them and
    with the team. “*I try to have a conversation to see if you are able to hold a
    conversation around data science beyond whatever technically you are good at.
    If we go beyond that I tend to pick up a paper and send it to the candidate and
    ask them to come in for a paper review. I think that works well, like an oral
    exam, better than having a time-pressured write-your-sort-algorithm,*” said Baiju
    Devani. It is also crucial to find people who are good at teamwork. “*I want to
    stress that having the communications skill with the head of marketing or the
    head of operations and everyone else in the company is really important. You need
    to talk to them to understand their data needs and show them what they need to
    see even though they might not necessarily be able to describe it,*” said Lindsay
    Farber. A great way to test for many of the important skills is to ask the candidates
    to walk the interviewer through one of their most interesting projects. “*I have
    discovered the best candidates that way and it never fails because that immediately
    gives the candidate hands to show you what exactly they can do and what technology
    they know, and how they think about problems, and how they communicate. You can
    see that there are some people who can't do it and some people who come ready
    and open their laptops and show you what they have built,*” said Amir Hajian.

  zh: 创建数据科学团队时存在许多细微差别，草率处理必然会导致失败。目前，应该明确不同技术角色和专业知识以及软技能如何交织在一起，形成一个能够在数据科学领域实现伟大目标的团队。选择加入这样一个团队的个体是一个巨大的挑战，需要谨慎进行。**“对我而言，团队文化是最重要的方面之一，因此我会寻找适合我团队和客户的成员。在我的团队中，数据科学家是具备非常高沟通技能的技术人员，他们能够与从数据科学家到副总裁和首席信息官的人员交谈。我在面试中通常会提出一个非常开放的案例研究，看看候选人是否能够提出正确的问题，找出正确的技术解决方案，并观察整个思考过程。”**
    奥兹格·耶洛格鲁说。她补充道**“显然，技术技能很重要，但只要他们懂得 Python 或 R，我相信他们会继续学习和提升。这很重要，因为数据科学是一个不断发展的领域，所以你不能停滞不前。”**
    招聘经理在面试中还应关注候选人的头脑风暴能力和与团队合作的能力。**“我会试图进行对话，看看你是否能够围绕数据科学进行讨论，而不仅仅是你技术上擅长的领域。如果我们超越这一点，我会倾向于拿起一篇论文并将其发送给候选人，要求他们来进行论文评审。我认为这样做效果很好，就像口试一样，比起在时间压力下让你写排序算法要好。”**
    拜祖·德瓦尼说。寻找擅长团队合作的人也至关重要。**“我想强调的是，与市场营销主管、运营主管以及公司其他所有人沟通的技能真的很重要。你需要与他们交谈，以了解他们的数据需求，并向他们展示他们需要看到的内容，即使他们可能无法准确描述出来。”**
    林赛·法伯说。测试许多重要技能的一个好方法是要求候选人向面试官介绍他们最有趣的项目之一。**“我发现通过这种方式找到最佳候选人，这从未失败过，因为这样可以立即让候选人展示他们能做什么、了解什么技术、如何思考问题以及如何沟通。你可以看到，有些人做不到这一点，而有些人则准备好并打开他们的笔记本电脑，向你展示他们所构建的东西。”**
    阿米尔·哈吉安说。
- en: Some of these characteristics come from personality but experience is also very
    important. That causes a big contradiction as there is almost no experienced data
    scientist out in the market. Majority of people looking for data science jobs
    are right out of school and therefore don't have the business experience needed.
    “*If you're lacking that industry experience I think doing Andrew Ng’s course
    and learning Python or working with really clean unrealistic data sets from Kaggle
    is one way to do it, but I think to build on that you need to get out there, come
    to meetups and summits, talk to other data scientists to find out what they do,
    and take a course in person. That helps you understand what different types of
    data scientists do,*” said Lindsay Farber. She also thought it is important not
    to aim too high for the first job; “*just get into a company at a junior level
    and work your way up. When you show interest and work hard, you will have that
    data analytics and data science background and the business insight to create
    a job for yourself.*” It is also crucial to tell others what is special about
    you beyond things that every can do like taking online courses. A good way to
    do that is “*to pick a problem that you're interested in and start building something
    around it. Teach yourself everything that you need to solve that problem. That
    makes the process of learning fun and you'll start learning all the technologies
    and the science you need as a data scientist*”, said Amir Hajian. You can do that
    if you are coming from academia or if you are already working in industry and
    looking into switching to data science. “*You should find that one extended project
    that is not in your job description but it will push you to get into the data
    science world. You can actually use your company's data, real-world data, and
    get experience that way and then you can show that you have the potential and
    desire,*” said Ozge Yeloglu. If you have a Kaggle competition dataset, go ahead
    and think outside of the box and figure out what else you can do with it. Even
    augment that with so many open-source datasets that exist and hopefully something
    interesting comes out of it.

  zh: 这些特征有些来自于个性，但经验也非常重要。这导致了一个大矛盾，因为市场上几乎没有经验丰富的数据科学家。大多数寻找数据科学职位的人都是刚刚毕业，因此没有所需的商业经验。“*如果你缺乏行业经验，我认为参加Andrew
    Ng的课程、学习Python或者使用Kaggle上那些非常干净的不现实的数据集是一个方法，但为了进一步发展，你需要走出去，参加聚会和峰会，与其他数据科学家交谈，了解他们的工作，并参加面对面的课程。这将帮助你了解不同类型的数据科学家的工作内容*，”Lindsay
    Farber说道。她还认为，第一份工作不应设定过高的目标；“*首先进入公司担任初级职位，逐步提升。当你表现出兴趣并努力工作时，你将拥有数据分析和数据科学的背景以及商业洞察力，最终为自己创造一个职位*。”此外，告诉别人你与众不同的地方也很重要，超越那些每个人都能做的事情，比如参加在线课程。一种好的方法是“*选择一个你感兴趣的问题，并围绕它开始构建一些东西。自学解决该问题所需的一切。这使学习过程变得有趣，你将开始学习作为数据科学家所需的所有技术和科学*，”Amir
    Hajian说道。无论你是来自学术界，还是已经在行业中工作并希望转行到数据科学领域，你都可以这样做。“*你应该找到一个不在你工作描述中的扩展项目，但它将推动你进入数据科学领域。你可以实际使用公司的数据、现实世界的数据，通过这种方式获得经验，然后你可以展示你的潜力和愿望*，”Ozge
    Yeloglu说道。如果你有一个Kaggle竞赛的数据集，尽管大胆地发挥创意，想想你还能用它做些什么。甚至可以与许多现有的开源数据集结合，希望能从中得到一些有趣的结果。

    and how companies monitor for that. The other side of the coin are people who
    are considering jobs and companies to join and they should ask questions in interviews
    or even before getting to the interviews when they''re collecting info about the
    company. “*The most interesting thing I heard when I was looking for a data science
    job was that when the interviewer is interviewing you, you are also interviewing
    the interviewer. That is your chance to find out what life is going to be like
    at this role. The important questions are: ‘who am I going to work with?’, ‘what
    is the team like’, and ‘what are the problems that you''re solving’. Ask them
    to walk you through the most exciting project that they have recently done and
    and listen very carefully and ask a lot of questions about it because that will
    show you everything about that company and that team*”, said Amir Hajian. An important
    point to remember in such conversations is that people work for managers not necessarily
    the company. “*Your manager is really the immediate person that you''re gonna
    deal with every day and they''re gonna decide your success in that company one
    way or another. So I think it''s really important to get a call with the hiring
    manager. Even if you''re not lined up for that call ask the recruiter for it.
    Then actually learn from that person and and see if you connect with them,*” said
    Ozge Yeloglu. She added “*I really love it when someone asks me about the growth
    opportunities because that tells me that they are aware that this is not an easy
    job and they have to really keep learning every day.*” It is also important for
    people to research what the company and the team they want to join do beforehand.
    “*Go on YouTube and see if any of the data scientists have given talks recently
    and watch all of them; see if they''ve published any papers read them and so that
    you bring that up in the interview instead of them telling you about it and then
    you can showcase your knowledge,*” said Lindsay Farber. It might be slightly harder
    but you should also “*try to figure out if you can talk to people who the data
    science team works with closely whether that''s on the business side or most likely
    from the engineering side. Figure out how well the engineering and data science
    teams work together and what kind of dynamics there are,*” said Baiju Devani.'

    说到阿米尔·哈吉安。奥兹格·耶洛格鲁指出，**“在这样的对话中要记住一个重要的点是，人们是为经理工作，而不一定是为公司工作。你的经理实际上是你每天都要打交道的人，他们会决定你在公司里的成功与否。所以我认为与招聘经理沟通真的很重要。即使你没有安排那次通话，也要要求招聘人员安排。然后从那个人那里实际了解一下，看你是否能和他们建立联系。”**
    她还补充道，**“我真的很喜欢有人问我关于成长机会的问题，因为这让我知道他们意识到这份工作并不轻松，他们必须每天不断学习。”** 对于想要加入的公司和团队，提前做研究也很重要。**“上YouTube看看是否有数据科学家最近做过演讲，观看所有这些演讲；看看他们是否发表过论文，阅读这些论文，这样你可以在面试中提到这些内容，而不是让他们告诉你，然后你可以展示你的知识。”**
    说到林赛·法伯。巴伊朱·德瓦尼建议，**“这可能会稍微困难一点，但你也应该尝试找出是否可以与数据科学团队紧密合作的人交流，不论是业务方面还是更有可能的工程方面。弄清楚工程和数据科学团队的合作情况以及有什么样的动态。”**
- en: Finally, it is important for practitioners to have a realistic picture of what
    their lives will be like as data scientists. “*If you're coming from academic
    background, remember that companies are not looking for this scholar person who
    knows everything and can talk about the philosophy of it. The company that is
    interviewing you has problems and there is a reason that they are interviewing
    you. Most probably they want you to help them with that specific problem. If you
    can figure that out and convince them that you are going there to help them to
    solve that problem you have that job. So be confident, figure out what the problem
    is, and tell them how you're going to solve it for them,*” said Amir Hajian. Lindsay
    Farber added “*you need to realize that you're not going to just wave a magic
    wand and solve everything with machine learning. 70% of the job is cleaning data
    and pre-processing. You also need to realize that you can have a huge impact doing
    just regular reporting basic statistics. You can take your company almost 80%
    of the way there and that you can then use hard core data science and build your
    own custom models to take that to the next level.*” In some sense, “*you're just
    a glorified SQL coder or business intelligence reporter most of the time. However,
    you got to be passionate about data and remember there are always ups and downs
    to any cycle, but if you are really passionate and excited about data then you
    will have a very interesting and fulfilling career,*” said Baiju Devani.

  zh: 最后，对于从业者来说，了解作为数据科学家的生活实际情况是很重要的。**“如果你来自学术背景，要记住公司并不是在寻找一个知道一切并能谈论其哲学的学者。面试你的公司有问题，他们面试你是有原因的。他们很可能希望你能帮助他们解决那个特定的问题。如果你能找出问题并说服他们你能帮助解决这个问题，你就能得到这份工作。所以要自信，找出问题，并告诉他们你打算如何解决它，”**
    阿米尔·哈吉安说道。林赛·法伯补充说**“你需要意识到，你不能仅凭机器学习就解决所有问题。70%的工作是清理数据和预处理。你还需要意识到，仅仅做常规报告和基础统计分析也可以产生巨大影响。你可以将公司推进到80%的进度，然后使用硬核数据科学和自定义模型将其提升到下一个层次。”**
    从某种意义上说，**“你大多数时间只是一个被美化的SQL编码员或商业智能报告员。然而，你必须对数据充满热情，并记住任何周期中总会有起伏，但如果你真的对数据充满热情并感到兴奋，你将拥有一个非常有趣和令人满意的职业，”**
    巴伊朱·德瓦尼说道。
- en: here are huge opportunities for data scientists to interact and learn from each
    other. One of the best ways to find your best next job opportunity or hire is
    to network with like-minded people. Keep an open mind, and be respectful of everyone,
    and try to help others as much as you can, and they will come back and help you
    when they can. It is very crucial to establish good professional relationships
    and maintain them. “*This might sound like a no-brainer to some of us but don't
    burn the bridges! For example, If you're going through an interview and if you
    realize it's not going the way that you were hoping don't get upset and defensive,
    rather ask them for their suggestions for things that you can improve,*” said
    Ozge Yeloglu. This is a small community of intellectuals that works hard to improve
    its collective wisdom and achieve great things, after all.

  zh: 数据科学家之间有着巨大的互动和学习机会。找到最佳的下一份工作机会或招聘的最佳方法之一就是与志同道合的人建立网络。保持开放的心态，对每个人都要尊重，尽可能地帮助他人，他们也会在有机会的时候回过来帮助你。建立并维护良好的职业关系是非常重要的。**“这对一些人来说可能显而易见，但不要断绝联系！例如，如果你正在面试，如果你意识到面试进展不如预期，不要感到沮丧或防御，而是请他们提出你可以改进的建议，”**
    奥兹格·耶洛格鲁说道。这是一个由知识分子组成的小社区，他们努力提升集体智慧并取得伟大成就。
