    and how much more they have stored. Many companies have been capturing customer
    data in some form or another for decades. Petabytes of data are traversing networks
    worldwide every day, and all of that data means big money — at least to the companies
    who can analyze and use it properly.

- en: Data has become a valuable commodity, similar to commodities like oil and gold,
    because most companies have similar types of data available to them. But, of course,
    there are also many different types of data, and different data holds different
    value for various companies. Not every company can have the same data strategy
    because the verticals a business needs to explore depend on the domain expertise
    of that business. Still, it is possible to put a value on the data a company owns,
    and those who combine their area of expertise with an ability to capture, analyze,
    and use data are the ones who will create the most value for their organization.

    be among the world's [most valuable resources](https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2021/07/22/how-has-data-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-commodity/44267/)
    because of how much potential revenue and business value it can provide. Moreover,
    it's available for sale and purchase. Indeed, some of the most influential companies
    globally, like Google and Facebook, have made their money mainly from the valuable
    and often intimate data they have on each of their consumers. The revenue reported
    by these companies, which provide free services to individual consumers, [is staggering.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/microsoft-linkedin-topped-3-billion-in-ad-revenue-in-last-year.html)

    we couldn’t really effectively navigate through all the information in those days.
    Then came Web 2.0, where platform-based environments like Google, Facebook, and
    YouTube came onto the scene. This simplified data access and exchange between
    the users, but it gave too much control to those organizations. Now, Web 3.0 is
    becoming more mainstream across the world with the rise of cryptocurrencies and
    non-fungible tokens. If you look into the future, 10 years from now, the end-user
    will have more power and control over the data that’s generated because of his
    daily activities, be it on social media, over email, or in the metaverse. Understanding
    what data to capture and how to harness this valuable commodity can spell the
    difference between life and death for the modern company. The most successful
    companies can integrate data from social media, emails, purchasing history, and
    IoT devices to create a very accurate picture of a person. These companies can
    then align their business models and strategies with customer desires to affect
    their outcomes. For example, marketing teams no longer have to send thousands
    of mailers out to potentially uninterested customers.

    when its female customers were pregnant. An irate father stormed into his local
    Target store, demanding to know why his teenage daughter was receiving mailers
    advertising diapers and other baby items. Several weeks later, he went back in
    to apologize — he had found out his daughter was indeed pregnant.

    data is the most valuable commodity for businesses today. Twenty years ago, the
    only data most companies cared about was related to transactions. For example,
    they used data to answer questions like how much their profit margin was, how
    sales affected inventory, and what their costs related to materials and shipping
    were. Along the way, however, companies learned that this data, while necessary,
    was not the key to unlocking revenue growth.

    AI and computing power, that understanding is becoming ever more fine-tuned. Just
    like Target's amazing ability to know when a woman was pregnant based on her purchases,
    today's data miners can modify advertisements and deliver them across devices
    to the exact person who is most likely to make a purchase. As a result, personalized
    recommendations make sales almost assured.

    but they're enabled by the reams of data these companies have about each of their

    for granted. A one-second lag in webpage load times could send a customer to a
    competitor. Therefore, companies need to know their customers' desires and habits.
    They should be asking questions like, “Who is visiting my website? What are they
    spending the most time on? What pages are they navigating to? Where were they
    when they clicked off the site?” By finding these answers and collecting data
    at various touchpoints in the customer journey, companies will be in a better
    position to align themselves with what their consumers want and gain a competitive
    edge over the substantial worldwide competition.

    Perhaps one of the most important considerations in understanding the value of
    data is that it may not always directly translate into cash, but this doesn’t
    make it any less valuable. Would you rather have a single sale right now, or an
    insight that will help you triple your sales revenue over the next year? This
    is the type of data insight we need to be mining for — future-fit foresight.

    predict what its customers want before they want it. When seconds count and with

    business outcomes.
