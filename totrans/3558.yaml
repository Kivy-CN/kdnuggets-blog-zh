    is becoming the most valuable asset for many companies, but [studies](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voltdb-survey-finds-that-big-data-goes-to-waste-at-most-organizations-259049401.html)
    show that most organizations use only a small part of the data they collect. With
    data volumes growing exponentially, and the increasing variety and heterogeneity
    of data sources, how can enterprises leverage more of their data?

    from the new and hot field of Data Curation. Unlike Data Integration, which uses
    a top-down approach for bringing diverse data sources into one model (not scalable
    to Big Data), Data Curation uses a bottom-up, data-driven approach. As Michael
    Brodie (who is an advisor to Tamr) put it in a [recent KDnuggets Interview](/2014/04/interview-michael-brodie-2-data-curation-cloud-computing-verizon.html)'

    is an exciting new startup which wants to solve the data curation problem. It
    was co-founded in Fall 2012 as Data Tamer by two serial entrepreneurs - [Michael
    Stonebraker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker), a legendary database
    researcher for whom it was a ninth startup, and [Andy Palmer](http://www.linkedin.com/in/andypalmer),
    who has been involved in founding and/or funding over 50 innovative companies.
    With such founders, the company has attracted a lot of financing - over $16 million
    from investors including Google Ventures and New Enterprise Associates (NEA),
    and a lot of attention, including a KDnuggets post [Data Tamer startup from Michael
    Stonebraker, Still in Stealth Mode](/2013/06/data-tamer-startup-from-michael-stonebraker-still-stealth-mode.html).'

    to improve with more data. The key ideas are
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**1\. Scalability through automation**: The size of the integration problems
    precludes a human-centric solution. Machine Learning methods are needed.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**2\. Data Cleaning**: Enterprise data sources are inevitably quite dirty.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**3\. Non-programmer orientation**: Current Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)
    systems have scripting languages that are appropriate for professional programmers.
    The scale of next generation problems requires that less skilled employees be
    able to perform integration tasks.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**4\. Incremental**: New data sources must be integrated incrementally as they
    are uncovered. Data Curation is **never finished**!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tamr also smartly combines automation and human expertise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It starts with using Machine Learning and Data Analysis algorithms to find relationships
    between data elements and tries to automate **most** data curation tasks. In cases
    when machine learning is not enough, it has well-defined processes and UI for
    asking human experts for help, and uses a smart rewards structure to encourage
    the experts.

    full text parser. Then, measure TF-IDF cosine similarity between columns. This
    method is suitable for text fields.

    the ratio of the size of the intersection of two columns' data to the size of
    their union. This method is well suited for categorical fields with small number
    of values.

    major drug company integrate data from 15,000 spreadsheets from its biologists
    and chemists doing lab experiments. These spreadsheets had about 1M rows and 100K
    attribute names.

    a collection of 300 insurance carriers, with 20 million records overall. The goal
    was to consolidate claims data by medical provider and Tamr solution was a significant
    improvement over previous approaches which required a lot of manual intervention.
