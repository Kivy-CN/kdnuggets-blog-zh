    developments. As surveyed in [141], there now exist over twenty domains in which
    AI programs are performing at least as well as (if not better than) humans. These
    advances have led to a massive burst of excitement in AI that is highly reminiscent
    of the one that took place during the 1956-1973 boom phase of the first AI hype
    cycle [56]. Investors are funding billions of dollars in AI-based research and
    startups [143,144,145], and futurists are again beginning to make alarming predictions
    about the incipience of powerful AI [149,150,151,152]. Many have questioned the
    future of humans in the job market, claiming that up to 47% of United States jobs
    are in the high-risk category of being lost to automation by 2033 [146], and some
    have gone as far as to say that AI could spell the end of humanity [141].

- en: In this article we argue that the short-term effects of AI are unlikely to be
    as pronounced as these claims suggest. Several of the obstacles that led to the
    demise of the first AI boom phase over forty years ago remain unresolved today,
    and it seems that serious theoretical advances will be required to overcome them.
    Moreover, the present infrastructure is ill-adapted to incorporating AI programs
    on a large scale, meaning that it is improbable that AI systems will be able to
    soon replace humans en masse. Therefore, the predictions mentioned above are unlikely
    to be met in the next fifteen years, and financiers may not receive an expected
    return on their recent investments in AI.

    mystical force that it is (or will soon be) able to supersede humans and solve
    any problem. For instance, Ray Kurzweil predicted, "artificial intelligence will
    reach human levels by around 2029," [150], and Gray Scott stated, "there is no
    reason and no way that a human mind can keep up with an artificial intelligence
    machine by 2035." [152]. An analogous but more ominous sentiment was expressed
    by Elon Musk, who wrote, "The pace of progress in artificial intelligence . .
    . is incredibly fast . . . The risk of something seriously dangerous happening
    is in the five-year timeframe. 10 years at most," [149] and later said, "with
    artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon" [152].

    worry among researchers that strong AI will soon have significant consequences
    for humanity’s future in the job market. For instance, in 2013 two Oxford professors,
    Frey and Osborne, published an article [146] titled, "The Future of Employment:
    How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerization?," in which they attempted to analyze
    the proportion of the job market that could become computerized within the next
    twenty years. They estimated that, "47% of total US employment is in the high-risk
    category, meaning that associated occupations are potentially automatable over
    some unspecified number of years, perhaps in a decade or two." Following that
    work, several papers have been written by various consulting firms and think tanks
    predicting that between 20 and 40 percent of jobs will be lost within the next
    twenty years due to automation [147,148]. Such predictions have sent ripples through
    the boardrooms of many businesses and governing bodies of various nations. Since
    AI systems are expected to reduce labor costs in the U.S. by a factor of ten,
    such predictions suggest that businesses could become significantly more profitable
    by employing AI programs instead of humans; however, this could force unemployment
    rates to reach staggering proportions, causing enormous economic disruption worldwide.'

    the first article of this series). Indeed, following several prominent advances
    in AI (such as the first self-learning program, which played checkers, and the
    introduction of the neural network [5,14]), government agencies and research organizations
    were quick to invest massive funds in AI research [40,41,42]. Fueled by this popularity,
    AI researchers were also quick to make audacious predictions about the incipience
    of powerful AI. For instance, in 1961, Marvin Minsky wrote, "within our lifetime
    machines may surpass us in general intelligence" [9].

    remains a serious complication and is typically done through trial and error.
    For the same reason, it is difficult to fix such solutions if something goes wrong
    [163,171]. In view of these issues and the fact that humans are taught to "treat"
    causes (and not symptoms), it is unlikely that many industries will be able to
    rely on deep learning programs, at least any time soon. For instance, a doctor
    is not likely to administer a drug to a patient based solely on a program’s prediction
    that the patient will become schizophrenic soon. Indeed, if the program’s prediction
    was inaccurate and the patient suffers an illness due to a side effect of the
    inappropriately administered drug, the doctor could face censure, with his or
    her only defense being that the trust on the AI system was misplaced.

    opportunity to reduce labor costs – by a factor of four – in high-wage countries

    outsourcing of service jobs from the U.S. began in 1990s, but the U.S. has cumulatively
    lost around 5 million such jobs. Hence, job losses due to outsourcing have totaled
    around 13 million, or around 8% of the 161 million U.S. working population. If
    the global economy were frictionless, most if not all 47% of the jobs predicted

    continuously mutating malware [161,162]; miscreants can use this to smuggle false
    data into the ANN training sets, thereby disrupting the learning process of the

    AI boom phase, which took place over forty-five years ago. There too, the field
    of AI saw many striking advances, audacious predictions, and massive investments.
    Eventually, that boom phase collapsed, primarily due to two reasons. The first
    was mechanical, due to limited and costly computational power in the 1970s; the
    second was conceptual, due to a lack of understanding of "intuition" and "human
