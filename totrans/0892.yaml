    used to operate and are looking after their own inefficiencies now. So yes, the
    data science world is not immune from the vantage of automation and is witnessing
    core machine learning engineering processes getting automated to enable smoother
    and faster development.

    selection, and deployment – were done manually. Each step is very rigorous and
    requires extensive effort from data scientists. Inarguably, automation becomes
    highly valued in helping data scientists through end-to-end modeling and deployment
    processes.

    rather an enabler for building better models faster. There is a gamut of things
    that are still done manually by data scientists and pose challenges to machine
    learning implementation. Ryohei Fujimaki, the CEO of [dotData](https://dotdata.com/),
    explains as follows.

    data scientists but instead as a tool of the trade. We've found that many enterprises
    now divide the feature engineering process out of the data science organization
    and into dedicated groups that focus on feature discovery. Regardless of the setup,
    providing automation tools and platforms to make the data scientist's job easier
    should be the focus.

    learning pipeline is data analysis and attesting to good quality data. Any failure
    or deviation to detail at this step can cost you heavily and thus calls for a
    skilled data analyst to set the foundations right.

    lift to the model to learn the phenomenon much faster. But the caveat is that
    these skills are built over time. So, instead of waiting to build the right team
    and skills to sift patterns through the humongous datasets and generate valuable
    insights, the automation of machine learning workflows removes the barriers to
    building models.

    by enabling non-technical experts to leverage the power of such sophisticated
    algorithms. Not only does automation help improve the model accuracy, but it also
    brings the industry’s best practices so no one has to reinvent the wheel on already
    solved areas involving repetition.

    automation can provide data scientists a great deal of aid without having to fear
    ''job losses.'' When AutoML first became popular, the dialogue in the DS community
    was largely about the pros and cons of automating the entire life cycle of the
    data science process. At dotData, we''ve found that such an "all or nothing" approach
    underestimates the complexity of the data science process - especially in large
    organizations. As a result, we believe that companies should focus instead on
    providing automation, which makes the life of the data scientist simpler and their
    job more effective. One such area is feature engineering. Data scientists spend
    an inordinate amount of time working with data engineers and subject matter experts
    to discover, develop and optimize the best possible features for their models.
    By automating a large part of the feature discovery process, data scientists can
    focus on the task they are truly designed to perform: building the best possible
    ML models.'

    human errors and biases which adds to model reliability. But, as experts say,
    excess of everything is bad. So, automation can be best utilized when assisted
    with some degree of human oversight to factor in real-time information and domain

    it essentially helps in streamlining repetitive and mundane tasks. Automation
    in data science is a big enabler for data scientists by cutting down on manual
    efforts thereby allowing for improved and efficient modeling processes. One must
    supplement AutoML with fair participation of human expertise and oversight to
    get the full benefits of automating the challenging parts of data science workflows.
