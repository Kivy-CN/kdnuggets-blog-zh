    tried to distill the key skills of the data scientist. In the post, I wrote:'

- en: When I ask myself the question, “What is data science?” I tend to think of the
    following five components. Data science is (1) the application of design thinking
    to data problems; (2) the creation and management of workflows for transforming
    and processing data; (3) the negotiation of human relationships to identify context,
    allocate resources, and characterize audiences for data analysis products; (4)
    the application of statistical methods to quantify evidence; and (5) the transformation
    of data analytic information into coherent narratives and stories.

    all five of the tentpoles of data science. Conversely, if you are good at all
    five tentpoles, then you’ll likely be a good data scientist.

    that post made the job of the data scientist seem easier than it is. This is because
    it wrapped all of these skills into a single job when, in reality, data science
    requires being good at **four** jobs. In order to explain what I mean by this,
    we have to step back and ask a much more fundamental question.

    based on the curriculum from most PhD programs, the core of the field involves
    statistical methods, statistical theory, probability, and maybe some computing.
    Data analysis is generally not formally taught (i.e., in the classroom) but rather
    picked up as part of a thesis or research project. Many classes labeled “Data
    Science” or “Data Analysis” simply teach more methods like machine learning, clustering,
    or dimension reduction. Formal software engineering techniques are also not generally
    taught, but in practice, are often used.
  prefs: []

- en: One could argue that data analysis and software engineering is something that
    statisticians *do*, but it’s not the core of the field. Whether that is correct
    or incorrect is not my point. I’m only saying that a distinction has to be made
    somewhere. Statisticians will always *do* more than what would be considered the
    core of the field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With data science, I think we are collectively taking inventory of what data
    scientists tend to do. The problem is that at the moment, it seems to be all over
    the map. Traditional statistics does tend to be central to the activity, but so
    does computer science, software engineering, cognitive science, ethics, communication,
    etc. This is hardly a definition of the core of a field but rather an enumeration
    of activities.

    If we had to teach something to all data science students without knowing where
    they might end up afterward, what would it be? My opinion is that at some point,
    all data scientists have to engage in the *basic data analytic iteration*.

  prefs: []

    the state of the science and what the key gaps are. The scientist also designs
    any experiments for collecting new data and executes the data collection. The
    scientist must work with the statistician to design a system for analyzing the
    data and ultimately construct a *set of expected outcomes* from any analysis of
    the data being collected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scientist plays a key role in developing a system that results in our set
    of expected outcomes. Components of this system might include a literature review,
    meta-analysis, preliminary data, or anecdotal data from colleagues. I use the
    term “Scientist” broadly here. In other settings, this could be a policy-maker
    or product manager.

    that will analyze the data generated by any data collection efforts. They specify
    how the system will operate, what outputs it will generate, and obtain any resources
    needed to implement the system. The statistician draws on statistical theory and
    personal experience to choose the different components of the analytic system
    that will be applied.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The statistician’s role here is to apply the data analytic system to the data
    and to produce the data analytic output. This output could be a regression coefficient,
    a mean, a plot, or a prediction. But there must be something produced that we
    can compare to our set of expected outcomes. If the output deviates from our set
    of expected outcomes, then the next task is to identify the reasons for that deviation.

    behavior can originate from anywhere. Any complex system is composed of multiple
    components, some of which may be your responsibility, and many of which are someone
    else’s. But bugs and anomalies do not respect those boundaries! There may be an
    issue that occurs in one component that only becomes known when you see the data
    analytic output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you are responsible for diagnosing a problem, it is your responsibility
    to investigate the behavior of each component of the system. If it is something
    you are not that familiar with, then you need to *become* familiar with it, either
    by learning on your own or (more likely) talking to the person who is, in fact,
    responsible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common source of unexpected behavior in data analytic output is the data collection
    process, but the statistician who analyzes the data may not be responsible for
    that aspect of the project. Nevertheless, the systems engineer who identifies
    an anomaly has to go back through and talk to the statistician and the scientist
    to figure out exactly how each component works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, the systems engineer is tasked with taking a broad view of all the
    activities that affect the output from the data analysis in order to identify
    any deviations from what we would expect. Once those root causes have been explained,
    we can then move on to decide how we should act on this new information.

    various constituents to achieve a reasonable outcome. Most statisticians and scientists
    that I know would recoil at the idea of being considered a politician or that
    politics in any form would play a role in doing any sort of science. However,
    my thinking here is a bit more basic: in any data analysis iteration, we are constantly
    making decisions about what to do, keeping in mind a variety of conflicting factors.
    In order to resolve these conflicts and come to a reasonable agreement, one has
    to engage a key skill, which is negotiation.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At various stages of the data analytic iteration, the politician must negotiate
    about (1) the definition of success in the analysis; (2) resources for executing
    the analysis; and (3) the decision for what to do after we have seen the output
    from the analytic system and have diagnosed the root causes of any anomalies.
    Decisions about what to do next fundamentally involve factors outside the data
    and science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Politicians have to identify who the stakeholders of the problem are and what
    it is that they ultimately *want* (as opposed to what their *position* is). For
    example, an investigator might say, “We need a p-value less than 0.05.” That’s
    their position. But what they *want* is more likely “a publication in a high profile
    journal.” Another example might be an investigator who needs to meet a tight publication
    deadline while another investigator who wants to run a time-consuming (but more
    robust) analysis. Clearly, the positions conflict, but arguably, both investigators
    share the same goal, which is a rigorous high-impact publication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Identifying positions versus underlying needs is a key task in negotiating a
    reasonable outcome for everyone involved. Rarely, in my experience, does this
    process have to do with the data (although data may be used to make certain arguments).
    The dominating elements of this process tend to be the nature of relationships
    between each constituent and the constraints on resources (such as time).

    scientist, statistician, systems engineer, or politician, then the chances are
    that is where you are weak at data science. I think a good data scientist has
    to have some skill in each of these domains in order to be able to complete the
    basic data analytic iteration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In any given analysis, the iteration may be applied anywhere from once to dozens
    if not hundreds of times. If you’ve ever made two plots of the same dataset, then
    you’ve likely done two iterations. While the exact details and frequency of the
    iterations may vary widely across applications, the core nature and the skills
    involved do not change much.
