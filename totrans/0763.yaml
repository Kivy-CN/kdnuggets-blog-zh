- en: There’s one single lesson I learned from using ChatGPT. It’s wonderfully helpful
    in data science, but you must scrutinize everything it outputs. It’s great for
    some tasks and can do them very quickly and accurately. For some other tasks,
    it’s good enough, and you’ll have to prompt it several times. And there’s one
    task I found ChatGPT is outright bad at.

    on the lower end of the spectrum, and fewer customers earn significantly higher
    incomes. The boxplot suggests there are some outliers on the higher end.

    can prompt it to write a web scraping code. You can instruct it to explore and
    prepare your data for the machine learning algorithms. It can also give you a
    code for choosing the right algorithm, dataset splitting, A/B testing, and performance-boosting
    algorithms. Finally, you can also ask ChatGPT to write you a code for model deployment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    get a code that does exactly what you want. So, you have to understand what you
    want to achieve and check the code. The chance is you’ll have to prompt ChatGPT
    for code corrections and provide more instructions on what to change.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main learning from all this is that ChatGPT is a bad master but a very good
    servant. It can be helpful in writing code, debugging, analyzing, and visualizing
    data. However, never trust it completely and never take what it writes without
    scrutiny.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    after all, and ChatGPT is not! You might not get the desired results from ChatGPT
    on the first try. But giving it more precise instructions and trying several times
    will probably get you to the desired result.
