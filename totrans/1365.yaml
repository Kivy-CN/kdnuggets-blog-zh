    hottest career paths. The demand for skilled data science practitioners in industry,
    academia, and the government is rapidly growing. The ongoing “*data rush*” is,
    therefore, attracting so many professionals with diverse backgrounds such as physics,
    mathematics, statistics, economics, and engineering. The job outlook for data
    scientists is very positive. [IBM predicts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/05/13/ibm-predicts-demand-for-data-scientists-will-soar-28-by-2020/#7916f3057e3b) the

- en: MOOCs, for the most part, are free online courses available for anyone to enroll.
    MOOCs provide an affordable and flexible way to learn new skills. MOOCs cover
    a broad spectrum of online courses in leadership, analytics, data science, machine
    learning, professional skills, engineering, business & management, humanities,
    computer science, and much more. These courses are usually offered by top universities
    across the world like MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley, University of Michigan, EPFL,
    Hong Kong Polytechnic University, The University of Queensland, and much more.
    Some courses are also offered by big corporations such as IBM, Google, and Microsoft.
    The greatest advantage of MOOC is the opportunity to learn from leaders and experts,
    and the privilege of taking courses from the world’s top universities.

    for individuals that already have a solid background in a complementary discipline
    (physics, computer science, mathematics, engineering, accounting) are trying to
    get into the field of data science. In my journey to data science, I found the
    following 3 data science specializations to be among the best in terms of quality
    and rigor.

    starting with MOOC. Then after building a solid background in data science fundamentals,
    you may then use the methods discussed in the next section to advance your knowledge

    what you get from online courses. This book provides a great introduction to data
    science and machine learning, with code included: **“Python Machine Learning,”
    by Sebastian Raschka**. The author explains fundamental concepts in machine learning
    in a way that is very easy to follow. Also, code is included, so you can actually
    use the code provided to practice and build your own models. I have personally
    found this book to be very useful in my journey as a data scientist. I would recommend
    this book to any data science aspirant. All that you need is basic linear algebra
    and programming skills to be able to understand the book. Other excellent data
    science textbooks are “[Python for Data Analysis](https://sushilapalwe.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/python-for-data-analytics-book.pdf)”

    on various topics in data science and machine learning by teaming up with other
    data science aspirants. Network with other data science aspirants, share your
    code on GitHub, showcase your skills on LinkedIn or Medium, this would help you
    to learn a lot of new concepts and tools within a short period. You also get exposed
    to new ways of doing things, as well as to new algorithms and technologies.

    MOOC. If you have a solid background in an analytic discipline such as physics,
    mathematics, economics, engineering, or computer science, and you are interested

    after establishing a solid foundation, you may then seek other ways to increase
    your knowledge and expertise, such as studying from textbooks, engaging in projects,
