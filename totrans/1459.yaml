    the load. This type of management covers all the conventional energy management
    principles concerning demand, distributed energy sources, and demand-side management
    along with modern energy challenges like energy saving, temporary load, and demand
    reduction. Therefore, smart energy management systems have developed abilities
    to combine smart end-use devices, distributed energy resources, and advanced control
    and communication.

    time. Specific real-time management applications and solutions allow monitoring
    metrics of energy use, define the activity pick and adjust the energy flow to
    the current demand rate. Moreover, there exist response management programs encouraging
    consumers to use energy at a specific time and save money. Thus, consumers get
    a chance to shift to a better pricing program and providers get an opportunity
