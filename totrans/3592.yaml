- en: Working on a data science project is always exciting. However, it is not without
    challenges. Each project requires you to install a (possibly) long list of libraries
    and specific versions of each library. So wrapping your head around the project’s
    dependency can be quite challenging. Here’s where **Docker** can help.

    your data science application—along with the code and required dependency—into
    a portable artifact called the **image**. Thus Docker facilitates replication
    of the development environment and makes local development a breeze.

    your way through your next project. We’ll work with images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/),
    one of the most popular platforms to find, share, and manage container images.

    familiar with Docker, you can try dockerizing your Python and data science applications.
    You can then push your application’s image to DockerHub. Other developers will
    then be able to pull your image and spin up containers—in their working environment—all
    with a single command.
