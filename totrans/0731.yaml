    package specifically developed for data analysis and manipulation. It’s one of
    the most-used packages and one you usually learn when starting a data science
    journey in Python.

    are limited to the LLM we pass on the SmartDataFrame object. In the future, I
    am sure that Pandas AI could handle much more detailed analysis as the LLM capability
    is evolving.

    AI needs to call the model.

    they consider the past result. That’s why it’s good practice to clear the cache.
    You can clear them with the following code.
