    similar to the one above, the data science field is full of jobs that tick nearly
    every box on the modern worker’s checklist. Working in data science gives you
    the opportunity to have job security, a high-paying salary with room for advancement,
    and the ability to work from anywhere in the world. Basically, working in data
    science is a no-brainer for those interested.

    someone looking for a career change, or even a cat, with no relevant work experience.

    We met as a result of being teamed up for our final four-month-long practicum.
    After graduation, we kept in touch. Almost two years later, I got a message saying
    that the company they work for is interested in hiring me to do some work for
    them. Thanks to maintaining that relationship, I managed to score my first job
    after graduation with no work experience thanks to my colleague putting my name
    forward.

    of this, it only makes sense that aspiring data scientists should write about

    are essential skills of data scientists that only improve when they’re being practiced.
    For example, by explaining the results of your data analysis to the general public,
    you begin to think of data in simple terms that anyone can understand and appreciate.
    As [Richard Feynman](https://blog.doist.com/feynman-technique/) once said, “I
    couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don’t understand
    it.” Not only will writing make you a better communicator, but it will also give
    you a deeper comprehension of data science concepts, thus making you a better
    data scientist.

    Not only will they be able to see that you’ve been able to build a following of
    people who trust and value your work, but they will also be able to see that you’re
    willing to contribute knowledge to further the lives and careers of fellow data
    scientists. Furthermore, publishing on a website that pays you for your work tells
    recruiters that people value your knowledge so much, that you’re actually getting
    paid for it.

    pain and suffering doing freelance work which is why it’s not for everyone). The
