- en: Machine learning gets a lot of buzz these days, usually in connection with big
    data and artificial intelligence (AI). But what exactly is it? Broadly speaking,
    machine learners are computer algorithms designed for pattern recognition, curve
    fitting, classification and clustering. The word learning in the term stems from
    the ability to learn from data. Machine learning is also widely used in data mining
    and predictive analytics, which some commentators loosely call big data. It also
    is used for consumer survey analytics and is not restricted to high-volume, high-velocity
    data or unstructured data and need not have any connection with AI.

    regression and k-means clustering, are also frequently called machine learners.
    For examples, see Apache Spark's [machine learning library](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/mllib-guide.html)
    or the books I cite in the last section of this article. To keep things simple,
    I will refer to well-known statistical techniques like regression and factor analysis
    as older machine learners and methods such as artificial neural networks as newer
    machine learners since they are generally less familiar to marketing researchers.

    used for a wide range of purposes. Though hard to describe simply, ANN have been
    inspired by notions of how the human brain functions. They come in many [flavors](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=neural+network+architecture&sa=X&biw=1408&bih=649&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&ved=0ahUKEwjvp-C30KzJAhXnHaYKHcCGA08QsAQINw)
    and are used for classification, regression, clustering, text mining and for assortment
    of real-time analytics. ANN are also frequently a core part of artificial intelligence
    and deep learning. Downsides can include long runtimes, the tendency to overfit
    (predict new data poorly), and that they are hard to interpret owing to their
    complexity. Neural networks and AI are sometimes used synonymously, which is misleading
    since other machine learners are also used in AI software.'

    in the early 1960s. Though first developed for binary (two-group) classification
    problems, these machine learners have been extended to multi-group classification
    and quantitative dependent variables and are now used for a variety of applications.
    Like ANN, SVM are complex but the basic idea – shown in this [image](http://ivplab.cs.thu.edu.tw/research/mi/03/index.files/image040.gif)
    – is to construct a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes that can be used for classification,
    regression and other tasks. Runtimes can be quite long, especially with very large
    data files, and choices the modeler makes can have a big impact on the results
    (also true of ANN and many other tools). SVM attract considerable interest in
    the machine learning community and there have been many recent advances in this
    area.'

- en: '*Random forests* and *AdaBoost* – short for adaptive boosting – are highly
    popular among data scientists. Their most common implementations employ a [committee
    of fools](https://i.imgur.com/BmEWJhA.png)’ strategy. Random forests is fast and
    well-suited for parallel computing. It''s easy to use and works well for predicting
    either group memberships or quantities. Random selections of cases (e.g., consumers)
    and variables are used to build hundreds or sometimes thousands of weak learners
    – mini-models that predict poorly but better than chance – and the modal or median
    result used as the prediction for each case. Most often random forests are based
    on decision trees but other methods can be used as base learners. One downside
    is that random forests is perhaps too easy and less experienced modelers may be
    tempted to choose it over other methods that would perform better.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AdaBoost, likewise, is versatile and not restricted to decision trees as the
    base learner, though decision trees are fast to run and usually adequate. A major
    point of differentiation from random forests is that all cases are used and weighted
    up or down depending on how difficult they are to predict accurately, with hard
    cases receiving more weight as the algorithm passes through the data. With very
    noisy data, AdaBoost can perform poorly by chasing outliers. As is true of random
    forests, there are variations of boosting and one kind, stochastic gradient boosting,
    has become especially popular in recent years.

- en: There are a vast number of machine learners that come in handy for all sorts
    of analytics in many fields. Some have only appeared in the past few years while
    others were developed decades ago and, as I've noted, the meaning of machine learning
    itself is not clear-cut. It's best to ask for specifics when you are not certain
    how the term is being used.
  prefs: []

- en: 'No single machine learner will work best in all situations and it''s not unusual
    for multiple algorithms to be combined. The chief advantages of what I am calling
    the newer methods are that they can be faster, easier to use or more accurate
    in certain situations. Examples include:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Older methods can still be used effectively in these circumstances but model-building
    can sometimes become quite time-consuming. In addition, some newer software has
    been designed for specific purposes – such as text analytics – and will nearly
    always be the better choice for those purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A downside of the newer methods is that they are typically less helpful for
    understanding the mechanism that gave rise to the data (for example, why certain
    types of consumers behave as they do). Most newer machine learners do not use
    equations that can be readily understood by non-specialists or easily put into
    words. Older methods, on the other hand, are usually more informative. That said,
    it's not always either/or and in some projects we can enjoy the best of both worlds
    by using newer machine learners for predictive modeling and older ones to shed
    light on the *why* and *how*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another advantage of the older machine learners is that they generally require
    smaller training samples to achieve the same level of accuracy on new data. Most
    were developed during an era in which data collection and processing were much
    more expensive. This can be a big advantage as most marketing researchers analyze
    small data.

    learning is not simply a matter of pressing ENTER. Defining the goals and objectives
    of the project and having a team of people with the right mix of skills and experience

    and data setup and cleaning usually absorb a substantial part of an analyst''s
    time. “[Data, data, data: Understanding the role of predictive analytics”](http://www.quirks.com/articles/2015/20150927-2.aspx)
