- en: Log transformations of dependent and independent data is an easy way to handle
    non-linear relationships. The transformation helps to analyze non-linear relationships
    using linear models. We have discussed the log-linear regression. There are two
    more variants – a) linear–log regression –the independent variables are log transformed
    and b) log-log regression – both the dependent and independent variables are transformed.
    The table below displays the equations and interpretation for each of the models.

- en: Binary logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical
    and takes values - 0 and 1\. Unlike simple linear regression, where conditional
    distribution of dependent variable is normal, in logistic regression the conditional
    distribution of dependent variable is Bernoulli. In Bernoulli distribution the
    variable can only take two values – 0 and 1 with certain probabilities.

    the ability to convert a penalty depends on number of hours of practice by the

    Y=1 increases (decreases) as X increases. Logistic regression is one of the widely
    used model of class prediction. The multinomial logistic regression extends the
    binary model to deal with problems involving multiple classes. For example, whether
    a person will redeem coupon A, coupon B or coupon C. Now we will implement the
    logistic regression model in R. The sample data consists of two variables – success/

    We can see that the model does a good job. The probability of success increases
    with increase in practice hours. The model is represented in equation [5]. The
    probability values can be obtained by plugging in the number of practice hours.

- en: In this article we learned about Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Simple linear
    regression is the most basic form of GLM. Advance form of GLM helps to deal with
    non-normal distributions and non-linear relationships in a simple manner. We focus
    on log-linear regression and binary logistic regression. Log-linear regression
    is useful when the relation between dependent and independent variable is non-linear.
    It also provides a quick fix when dependent variable follows log-normal or Poisson
    distribution.

- en: Further, we discussed the basic concepts of binary logistic regression. Binary
    logistic regression is beneficial when the dependent variable follows Bernoulli
    distribution, i.e. can take only values of 0 and 1\. We also provide equations
    and interpretation for various log transformations that are used with regression
    models.
