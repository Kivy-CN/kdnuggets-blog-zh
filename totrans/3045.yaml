    you can image, data is an important asset (maybe the most important one) for companies
    right now. So before you can apply machine learning or deep learning, at all,
    you need to have it, know what you have, understand it, govern it, clean it, analyze
    it, standardize it (maybe more) and then you can think of using it.

    the graph. You can tell a graph that parents have children and parents can be
    children and children can be brothers or sisters, and all of these are people.
    Providing such descriptive information allows new information to be inferred from
    the graph such as the fact that if two people have the same parents they must
    be siblings.
