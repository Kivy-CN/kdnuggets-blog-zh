    to coding environments**. We still disagree who should call themselves a data
    scientist, but one aspect that certainly differentiates data scientists from computer
    scientists is the need to have data closely tied to projects for the purposes
    of data manipulation and modeling.'

    stack away from the operating system. For data scientists, containers have historically
    offered few benefits.

    are turning to containers to solve a new set of problems unique to the data science
    community. I believe containers will soon rule all data science work.

    entire projects, complete with runnable Jupyter notebooks can be passed to anyone

- en: Nearly all companies provide Virtual Machines to their teams of data scientists
    to accomplish sandbox or production data science jobs. Over time, there is a proliferation
    of machines in an organization with projects that need to be migrated. Without
    a strategy for migrating projects, data science jobs break or there is an explosion
    of nearly worthless VM’s.

    applications. Kubernetes deploys and manages the underlying containers, however,
    the project must be containerized first.

    (and potentially a huge price tag). When you develop using cloud services you
    are stuck with that cloud provider for that project until you retire the project
    or purposefully migrate away from it.
