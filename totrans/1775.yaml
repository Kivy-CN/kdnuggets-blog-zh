    a data scientist interview at some of the top companies. Unfortunately for us,
    almost every company has their interviewees sign NDAs. Since Glassdoor allows
    anonymity, a few brave souls have given us some fantastic examples of what they
    were asked during the interview process at top companies like Facebook, Google,
    and Microsoft.'
