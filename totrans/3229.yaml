    the number of views. I have also taken special care to walk you through the world
    of ML in Finance in a gentle, step-by-step manner. To get you motivated, we first
    begin with talks on the various applications of ML in Finance. Then, to enable
    access to free financial data, is a video detailing various sources for the latter.
    To get your hands dirty, we then move on to R and Python tutorials for specific
    financial use cases. Want to proceed to a comprehensive study of applications
    of ML in Finance? I have saved the best for last: two playlists that cover the
    breadth of ML in Finance :) Let’s begin!'

    are the funds that have performed well consistently over a short, medium and long
    term. Learn to use a scatterplot to plot the returns over 1 year and 3 years,
    interpret the graphs and label the companies.

- en: Siraj Raval’s YouTube videos on ML are a rage. Here, he teaches you 40 lines
    of code to build a stock-price prediction graph using Python’s scikit-learn. Build
    3 predictive models that predict the prices of Apple stock, then plot them on
    graphs to compare which predictive model performs best.

    and concise manner. In another video by him, the training data was a time series
    of daily closing prices of S&P 500 from January 2000- August 2016\. He predicts
    closing prices for a specific day using an LSTM network using Keras with a TensorFlow
    backend.

    trading, interviews with traders, documentaries on stock markets, discussions
    on backtesting, to ML tutorials to implement various quantitative strategies.
    The playlist could improve in the area of organization, though, as the videos
    are in random order.

- en: Saving the very best for last, the ‘Python Programming for Finance’ playlist
    from sentdex is immaculately well-organized and implements algorithmic trading
    in Python. A full 10/10 for this playlist. It only involves programming tutorials,
    though and not videos on understanding finance concepts. However, the playlist
    above (‘Playlist1’) should help with that :)
