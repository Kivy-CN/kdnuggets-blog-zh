- en: The [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Industry_Standard_Process_for_Data_Mining)
    is a common standard for machine-learning projects. Business Understanding, Data
    Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation and Deployment. All these
    six steps of a machine-learning project are crucial. Quality issues in each step
    will directly affect the quality of the entire outcome. They are all important.

- en: However, advising to many organizations on machine learning, and running even
    more such projects ourselves, we (at YellowRoad) came to a conclusion, that the
    most under-invested step in the process is **Business Understanding**. We see
    many companies discussing algorithms and technology, before understanding the
    business aspects of the task that they are solving. This is clearly not a good
    starting point.

    that we get involved in, and we do not invest serious efforts in the following
    steps, until we have good answers to these questions. We find that practice to
    be extremely helpful.

    need to develop that ability? (if the ability is there, learn it carefully. If
