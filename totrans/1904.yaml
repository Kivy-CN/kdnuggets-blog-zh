    write her back, and her own profile attracted crickets (and worse). So, as any
    fan of data would do: she started making a spreadsheet. Hear the story of how
    she went on to hack her online dating life — with frustrating, funny and life-changing
    results.'

- en: What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it’s fame
    and money, you’re not alone – but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger,
    you’re mistaken. As the director of a 75-year-old study on adult development,
    Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction.
    In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well
    as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long
    life.

    global population, health and income data (and an extra-extra-long pointer), demonstrates
    that you have a high statistical chance of being quite wrong about what you think
    you know. Play along with his audience quiz — then, from Hans’ son Ola, learn
    4 ways to quickly get less ignorant.

    by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth.
    This is the paradoxical answer that Hans Rosling unveils at TED@Cannes using colorful
    new data display technology (you’ll see).

    swarm of birds — is more than the sum of its parts. And complexity theory, it
    turns out, can reveal a lot about how the economy works. Glattfelder shares a
    groundbreaking study of how control flows through the global economy, and how
    concentration of power in the hands of a shockingly small number leaves us all
    vulnerable.'

    media buzz, Facebook status updates) into beautiful, simple diagrams that tease
    out unseen patterns and connections. Good design, he suggests, is the best way
    to navigate information glut — and it may just change the way we see the world.

    and divide people in the same town. What can we learn about cities by looking
    at what people share online? Starting with his own home town of Baltimore, Dave
    Troy has been visualizing what the tweets of city dwellers reveal about who lives
    there, who they talk to — and who they don’t.
