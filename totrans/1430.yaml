    to describe everything from truly sophisticated applications and increasingly
    successful such as self-driving vehicles to mundane use of propensity scores in
    direct marketing. I predicted that, in 2019, people would catch on that this was
    all just math. I was half right.

    as "AI." The public is aware that facial recognition technology can be thwarted

    chatbots, and that you can spend millions trying to make software be smarter than

    we face another year of misunderstandings of biases, data that needs to be interpreted
    always takes a risk with bias. Unbiased data stands alone, it's doesn't need to
    be interpreted, example - Mary increased her sales ROI by 10% verses Mary is a
    hard worker, which is an opinion and can't be measure.

    thought before even reading was "No, but all the wanna-bees and hype surely didn't
    help our field - Data Science is more than writing code". Misunderstanding about
    tech plus the lack of data and the necessary infrastructure will continue to plague
    us in 2020 but at least SOME are realizing the sexiest job of the 21st Century
    isn't so sexy after all, as we spend most of our cleansing and prepping data before
    we get to glean insight and answer business questions.

    models, chat bots, etc, you build may have an effect on someone's life, data points
    in a database correspond to a life, so remove your bias and let the facts speak
    for themselves...as always, have fun and play with data responsibly.

    data analytics / data science tasks. Data scientists and engineers require tools
    that allow them to scale and solve more problems. This need will result in the
    development of automation tools across several stages of the data science process.
    For example, some data preparation and cleaning task are partially automated;
    however, they are difficult to fully automate due to the unique needs of companies.
    Additional candidates for automation include feature engineering, model selection,
    amongst others.

    is the engine that using science it's catalyzing change, and transforming papers

    We will see an increase in important online and offline education about data science
    and its friends. Hopefully, we'll become more confident in what we do and how
    we do it. Semantic technologies, decision intelligence, and knowledge data science
    will be our companions in the next years, so I recommend people to start exploring
    graph databases, ontologies, and knowledge representation systems.
