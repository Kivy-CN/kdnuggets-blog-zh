    If so, then the fields of [data science](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/09/what-is-data-science.html)
    and analysis provide many opportunities to impact just about any type of business,
    from retail to healthcare.

    bright minds are needed to fill the gaps. These fields are complex and sophisticated,
    but any individual who can harness the necessary skills will have many career
    options from which to choose. To better understand the possibilities, let’s look
    at the nuances of these positions and where you could work in the future.

- en: While there is a slew of new careers for both data analysts and scientists across
    many industries, those interested in these highly sought after positions must
    first decide which job they are most interested in. At its most basic, the [difference
    between these two positions](https://online.maryville.edu/online-bachelors-degrees/data-science/careers/data-scientist-vs-analyst/)
    is that the data scientist understands the need for data and mines for it, while
    the analyst uses the data they found to understand trends. Both jobs are showing
    [big potential](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/09/future-analytics-data-science.html),
    with some predictions stating that the need for these positions [will elevate
    by 28% by 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/05/13/ibm-predicts-demand-for-data-scientists-will-soar-28-by-2020/#244bb3d17e3b).

    field will need to have an advanced understanding of math, including [statistics
    and probability theory](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-math-for-data-science),
    which will be needed to interpret the data. An understanding of programming languages,
    including [Python and C/C++](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/simplilearn-9-must-have-skills-data-scientist.html),
    is also a requirement because coding is necessary to mine and organize the data

    field. Once they understand which data they need to find, models are created,
    and systems are programmed so that this data can be unearthed. Finally, they must
    know how to separate and interpret the data to verify that what they found is
    as useful as they hope.

    to make sense of the data created by the scientist. They work in a variety of
    industries to either solve problems or predict trends and then provide their statistical
    analysis to management and stakeholders in an easily digestible format. Data analysts
    need to understand numbers. They need to be able to use critical thinking and
    see through the details to come up with logical conclusions, and if they need
    more info, they have to communicate their needs clearly to the data scientist.

    doctor, buying groceries, or watching videos online, and all of that data is crucial
    for the creation and advancement of a company's products. While this is a known
    fact to many business professionals, a manager or CEO may not comprehend how to
    obtain and present this information, and that is why the careers of data analysts
    and data scientists are so highly sought after.

    The skills can be used to determine what customers are buying and what they are
    interested in purchasing in the future so that better marketing campaigns can
    be devised. After the campaign is created, data can then measure how the customers
    are taking to the marketing, and if they are buying what the company is trying
    to sell. One example is Netflix, which often sends out emails recommending a particular
    movie or TV show. They create these suggestions by going through the data and
    finding out what interests subscribers, with the intended end result of getting
    you back on their platform.

    potential damage to products or customers, along with a plan of action to solve
    the issues. Data analysts and scientists help with this too. For example, [banks
    can use data analysts to gauge the risk involved in offering a high-dollar loan](https://www.bizfilings.com/toolkit/research-topics/finance/business-finance/what-banks-look-for-when-reviewing-a-loan-application),
    or transportation companies can better understand the risk of potential accidents
    as well as how to make the claims process easier so their vehicles can stay on
    the road and improve overall efficiency.

    so someone looking into these two careers can have their pick of the litter. For
    instance, [the healthcare industry has taken to data analytics](https://healthinformatics.uic.edu/blog/how-health-care-analytics-improves-patient-care/)
    to look at a number of areas, including physician performance, patient and hospital
    costs, and health risks in any particular area of the world. Big data is even
    making strides towards solving the opioid crisis and understanding trends that
    [could cure cancer](https://www.datapine.com/blog/big-data-examples-in-healthcare/).

    is also looking for bright minds that can help find alternative energy sources,
    increase efficiency with current power, and find new ways to avoid power outages
    in problem areas. The manufacturing industry also uses data to understand the
    supply and demand of the products they produce, so companies save money, and customers
    get what they need. Data can also help to predict when machinery might break down
    so preventive maintenance can keep the factory working on all cylinders.

    that is why data professionals encourage businesses to protect this valuable information.
    To [avoid data loss](https://www.ontrack.com/blog/2019/01/14/key-mistakes-that-lead-to-data-loss/),
    experts recommend taking the time to keep all backup systems up to date and to
    immediately avoid using a server if it is found to be corrupted. Protecting data
    is essential, because losing information, particularly user records, could result
    in a loss of customers and revenue.
