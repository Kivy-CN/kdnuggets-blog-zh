  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a working familiarity with data science and the terminology used
    in the sector, it can be especially difficult to separate yourself from those
    words and definitions and remember that other people don't have the same level
    of understanding about the topic that you do. As you discuss your data science
    work, aim to avoid language that could make others continually confused as they
    listen.

    people can grasp the importance of. For example, you could talk about how you
    built a [data science project from scratch](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-data-science-project-from-scratch-dc4f096a62a1/),
    and how doing that required identifying a problem, cleaning the data, analyzing
    your information, choosing a model and more.

    to examples that virtually everyone can understand regardless of their backgrounds.
    One professional needed to convince a team of people without data expertise about
    the worthiness of building a centralized metadata repository. She ultimately used
    Andy Warhol's famous soup can pop art to [get on the same level](https://tdwi.org/Articles/2015/08/18/Talking-Data-with-Non-Data-People.aspx?Page=2)

    label as metadata. Then, they envisioned how hard it would be if they had a pantry
    full of soup cans without labels. She drove her message home by relating that
    scenario to how the lack of a metadata repository created unnecessary confusion
    for end users and got the understanding she wanted.
  prefs: []

- en: Ask yourself if there's a similar way you could apply analogies to your data
    science work to emphasize why it matters. This approach could be especially valuable
    if you're struggling to get the nod of approval from a superior about a planned
    data science project that requires additional funding or time.

    apply to every company that may give you an interview. Since that's not likely,
    you'll need to do the next best thing by [looking at a project differently](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/articles/how-to-show-awareness-of-the-wider-commercial-impact-of-data-science)
    — through the lens of the company's needs. Look at the projects you've done so
    far, and then assess how your expertise fits into a company's current requirements
    or upcoming plans.

    machine learning or neural networks, you might focus on its [efficiency or value-based
    metrics](https://www.vansystems.com/online-guides/guide-to-automating-your-business/chapter-5-how-to-measure-and-report-on-the-success-of-automation/).

    expertise and automation's capabilities could help a company reach the next level.

    a potential employer, choose one or two projects that best align with the issues

    could benefit the enterprise.

    have found yourself in the running for a promotion, you've probably dug out your
    resume and made sure it's up to date, so decision-makers have the most relevant
    information about you.

    resume, especially if you already have experience with putting them to work in
    real life. While fleshing out the section that outlines your responsibilities,
    call attention to specific ways the projects you assisted with brought concrete
    advantages to the company.

    they look for evidence that the work performed resulted in things like direct
    value to the company or its customers or generated helpful insights from raw data.
    You could summarize your role in making those things happen by indicating something
    like, "built a script that aggregated data from multiple databases and improved
    user productivity during data analysis by an average of 40%."
