    data-driven. The huge amount of data they collect is stored in a database. The
    management, analysis, and processing of this data is made through a DBMS(Database
    Management System). As a consequence of this shift, data science came forward
    as one of the most emerging fields with countless job opportunities. A data scientist
    needs to extract the data from the database and this is where SQL comes into play.
    You must have heard about the topmost data science skills to master this field
    and SQL is one of them. Now, the question is: **Do I really need to master SQL
    as a good data scientist?**'

    work with different tables and the result of one query may be used again to further
    restrict the data in the main query. It is also known as the nested or the inner
    query. The subquery must be enclosed in the parenthesis and it is executed before
    the main query. If it returns more than one row, then it is called a multi-line
    subquery and multi-line operators must be used with it.
