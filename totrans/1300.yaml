    encounter opportunities to use container management solutions. Here, we’ll look
    at two solutions — [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Amazon Elastic Container
    Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) — from a perspective that makes sense
    for aspiring and current data scientists.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re interested in building and using machine learning models as part of
    your work as a data scientist, tutorials exist that walk you through doing that
    on both platforms. Amazon provides [a step-by-step walkthrough](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-deep-learning-models-on-amazon-ecs/)
    aimed at data scientists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, there is a machine learning [toolkit for Kubernetes users](https://ubuntu.com/blog/kubernetes-for-data-science-meet-kubeflow)
    called Kubeflow. It’s an open-source, portable and scalable solution. People can
    apply it to any new or existing Kubernetes deployments.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you look at comparisons between Kubernetes and ECS, don’t be surprised to
    find details about availability zones and overall reliability. Choosing a dependable
    service can help you avoid outages that could temporarily derail your data science
    projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ECS runs in 69 availability zones and 22 regions. Also, ECS falls under the
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) umbrella. That means it [guarantees an uptime rate](https://towardsdatascience.com/stuck-between-ecs-and-kubernetes-6b5d42c000b5)
    of at least 99.99%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kubernetes emphasizes reliability with an approach that spreads Kubernetes pods
    among nodes to make them more tolerant of application failures. Moreover, the
    high availability of Kubernetes extends to both the infrastructure and application
    level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, with the release of Kubernetes 1.2 came [support for running single
    clusters](https://unofficial-kubernetes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/multiple-zones/)
    in multiple availability zones offered by cloud providers. However, the selected
    zones must be in the same region and provided by the same cloud service.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That Kubernetes version offered multiple zone selection automatically to AWS
    and Google Compute Engine (GCE) users. However, applying the appropriate labels
    to nodes and volumes creates support for additional cloud services.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amazon ECS is part of the AWS ecosystem. That brings advantages in some cases
    and downsides in others. For example, it’s easier and faster to perform the initial
    setup compared to Kubernetes because you can do it through the AWS Management
    Console and don’t need to set up the control panel that Kubernetes requires.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, ECS [also has a high level](https://bluesentryit.com/kubernetes-versus-amazon-ecs-a-peculiar-comparison/)
    of vendor lock-in, which prevents you from migrating a containerized application
    to any other provider or platform. In contrast, Kubernetes is an open-source solution
    that enables moving containers elsewhere, including to hybrid and multi-cloud
    providers.

- en: AWS regularly releases new products of interest to data scientists, though.
    For example, in 2018, the company rolled out [a machine learning marketplace](https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-web-services-announces-13-new-machine-learning-services)
    containing more than 150 new models and algorithms to try. You can also find [detailed
    breakdowns of AWS products](https://www.marktechpost.com/2019/09/28/ai-and-data-science-tools-on-amazon-web-services/)
    that could support your data science projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you already use many products offered by AWS or plan to do so soon, choosing
    ECS could make more sense than going with Kubernetes. Otherwise, you may find
    ECS too restrictive.

- en: It’s easy for data scientists to find general information about using ECS, but
    specifics about how to use ECS in their work are not as common. This reality may
    mean that people spend more time than expected learning how to apply ECS to data
    science projects, particularly in the early stages of their usage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although some courses for data scientists [cover how to use ECS](https://www.educative.io/courses/data-science-in-production-building-scalable-model-pipelines/7DQxPXQnN8y),
    the content often encompasses only single modules with classes that address a
    broader assortment of data science topics within the curriculum.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, you can [quickly find Kubernetes explainers](https://mlinproduction.com/intro-to-kubernetes/)
    geared toward data scientists. These make it easier to envision why you may want
    to use it over other services. Similarly, content creators give real-life examples
    of [applying Kubernetes to data science projects](https://opensource.com/article/19/1/why-data-scientists-love-kubernetes),
    such as predicting customer churn rates.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some data scientists may want to work with ECS or Kubernetes while paying for
    the costs themselves instead of relying on an employer. In such cases, calculating
    the expenses associated with ECS can pose fewer challenges because AWS offers
    price calculators to avoid surprises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also free tiers associated with AWS products. That sounds like a good
    thing at first. However, users report receiving large bills after their [eligibility
    for free services expired](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/09/aws-free-tier/)
    without them realizing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary reason why calculating the pricing with Kubernetes is not as simple
    is the [growing network of certified service providers](https://www.cncf.io/certification/kcsp/)
    that can help people start using Kubernetes. Some of those entities offer products
    with built-in Kubernetes support, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means the prices you pay for using Kubernetes through those providers will
    vary. The ideal approach is to create a list of products or companies that interest
    you and offer Kubernetes support. Then, take the time to research their pricing
    structures and see which ones seem most appropriate for your budget and the extent
    of data science work you want to do with Kubernetes.

    when choosing between Kubernetes and ECS. Both have pros and cons that could ultimately
    affect data science projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, allowing enough time to learn about each solution is a smart move.
    Consider any projects in your pipeline that may apply to your use of a containerization
    solution. Then, review each product's features and determine which ones are most
    relevant to your situation and expectations. Scrutinizing each option this way
    will lead to well-informed decisions.
