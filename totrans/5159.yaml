- en: Whether we like it or not, data prep is a major part of every data science project.
    Data preparation consists of tasks to prepare data in a repeatable process for
    use in business analytics, including data acquisition, data storage and handling,
    data cleaning, and early-stages of feature engineering.

    SQL. Not only is SQL widely known and used in most organizations, but it also
    leverages existing database resources, security, and pipelines. If your raw data
    is in a SQL-based data lake, why spend the time and money to export the data into
    a new platform for data prep?

    will give a sampling of SQL approaches to each of the steps in data preparation.
    This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of SQL functions or options, but rather
    a starting point.

- en: A final word on creating an interface to your model. SQL views allow you to
    wrap up the complexity of many of the data prep steps in a clean, secure, modular
    format. Rather than embedding long, complex queries in your Python or R code,
    you can create a view that allows access to that code in a simple, reusable format.
    Views are also a great way to apply security on private data elements by masking
    or hiding those from model access.
