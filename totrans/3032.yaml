    together, like Currier and Ives or Sturm and Drang? If so, you've come to the
    right place. This article will clarify some important and often-overlooked distinctions
    between the two to help you better focus your learning and hiring.

    with their terminology. In popular discourse, it has taken on a wide swath of
    meanings and implications well beyond its scope to practitioners. Machine learning
    refers to a specific form of mathematical optimization: getting a computer to
    perform better at some task, through training data or experience, without explicit
    programming. This often takes the form of building a model based on past cases
    with known outcomes, and applying the model to make predictions for future cases,
    finding ways to minimize a numerical “error” or “cost” function representing how
    much the predictions mismatch reality.'

    The [Harvard Business Review tells us](https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists)
    that the “key skills for data scientists are not the abilities to build and use
    deep-learning infrastructures. Instead they are the abilities to learn on the
    fly and to communicate well in order to answer business questions, explaining
    complex results to nontechnical stakeholders.” [Other authors agree](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/analyzing-the-analyzers/9781449368388/ch04.html):
    “We feel that a defining feature of data scientists is the breadth of their skills
    — their ability to single-handedly do at least prototype-level versions of all
    the steps needed to derive new insights or build data products.” [Another HBR
    article](https://hbr.org/2018/03/getting-value-from-machine-learning-isnt-about-fancier-algorithms-its-about-making-it-easier-to-use)
    affirms, “Getting value from machine learning isn’t about fancier algorithms —
    it’s about making it easier to use…. The gap for most companies isn’t that machine
    learning doesn’t work, but that they struggle to actually use it.”'

    many. Thinking of machine learning as the whole of data science is akin to thinking
    of accounting as the entirety of running a profitable company. Further, the skills
    gap in data science is largely in areas complementary to machine learning — business
    sensibility, statistics, problem framing, and communication.

    on machine learning education over a more balanced curriculum. This has unfortunately
    led to a glut of underprepared early-career professionals seeking data science
    roles. Both of the authors, and several other data science hiring managers with
    whom they spoke when preparing this article, have interviewed numerous candidates
    who advertise their knowledge of machine learning but who can say little about
    basic statistics, bias and variance, or data quality, much less present a coherent
    project proposal to achieve a business objective.

    to the siren’s call of an education too rich in machine learning. We speculate
    that this is because machine learning uses the same type of thinking that already
    comes easily to software developers: algorithmic, convergent thinking with clearly
    defined objectives. An education that is hyper-specialized in machine learning
    offers the false promise of more interesting work without demanding any fundamental
    cognitive shifts. Sadly, the job market rarely delivers on this promise, and many
    who follow this path find that they are unable to make the career shift from engineer
    to scientist.'

    somebody has designed and implemented an algorithm, everybody can use it with
    virtually no cost of replication. Of course everyone will want to use the best
    algorithms, created by the best researchers. Most organizations cannot afford
    to hire top-tier algorithm designers, many of whom receive seven-figure salaries.
    Thankfully, much of their work is available to the public in research papers,
    open source libraries, and cloud APIs. Thus the world’s best ML algorithm designers
    have an outsized impact, and their work enables the generalist data scientists
    who use their algorithms to have a large impact in turn.

    the specifics of a *particular* company's business, needs, and assets. Most organizations
    of a certain size need their *own* data scientist. Even if some other company's
    data scientist had published their approach in detail, it's virtually certain
    that some aspects of the problem and situation will differ, and the approach cannot
    just be copied in toto.

    Learning Engineers at large companies actually do very little machine learning
    themselves. Instead, they spend most of their time building data processing pipelines

    The job market reflects this. If you are seeking employment, you will likely do
    best by consuming machine learning education as just one part of a balanced diet.

    do best by hiring a generalist.
