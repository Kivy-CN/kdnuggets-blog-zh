    visualisations to make the data look pretty or applying a decision tree to unclean
    data, is just a waste of your time. You can create all the models in the world,
    but it’s no use if you present your findings and there are errors popping up one
    by one. What if your findings were taken as gospel, and the company makes important
    decisions based on these? None of us want to be in that uncomfortable position.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data quality is the measure of how fit a data set is to serve its specific purpose
    and how trusted it is to make trusted decisions. It is made up of characteristics
    such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, and timeliness. Let’s briefly
    break these down further.

- en: '**1\. How was the data collected?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The source of the data matters. For example, was the data collated through a
    Government Census, or was it collated by somebody who manually created the data
    for their personal needs and uploaded it on Kaggle. Collating data from people
    on their commute to work and are not as interested is different from sending them
    a web link of a survey that they can fill out in their own time.
