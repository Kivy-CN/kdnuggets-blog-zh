    of diversity and ethics and related subjects as periphery concerns in machine
    learning to viewing them as core considerations alongside technology. Let's hope
    this trend continues into 2021 and beyond.

    real question is – would few shot learner models (like GPT-3) change the way models
    are built? Instead of the traditional sequence of building a model from data reflecting
    a problem, we could flip it. We can think of just a forward pass with very large
    models i.e. Model – Problem – Inference. Of course, we need a massive pre-trained
    model like GPT-3\. If this trend does take off – it will be transforming for AI
    over the next two years.

    sense that everyone would be using some form of basic ML or DL. So, we could shift
    from data science to decision science. The output of data science is a model with
    a performance metrics (for example accuracy). With decision science, we could
    take this further by suggesting actions and execute these actions. That means
    algorithms like reinforcement learning could be a part of 2021 and beyond

    and there''s a much better understanding of what projects are likely to succeed.

    solve every problem as well as we would like. Two papers this year sum up this
    trend. The Hardware Lottery ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06489v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06489v1))
    describes how much serendipity can be involved in which algorithms rise to prominence

    Presents Challenges for Credibility in Modern Machine Learning ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03395](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03395))

    NLP methods on a scale that's utterly impractical for the vast majority of NLP
    applications. What I personally find far more exciting is the growing trend of
    focusing on small, efficient models that still perform well. The first SustainNLP
    workshop ([https://sites.google.com/view/sustainlp2020/home](https://sites.google.com/view/sustainlp2020/home))

    so from home. If the mainstream acceptance of remote work and education persists
    after the pandemic -- which seems likely -- then we can look forward to two competing
