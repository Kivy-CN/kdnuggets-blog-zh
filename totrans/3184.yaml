- en: Welcome to the second chapter of ML lessons from Ng’s experience. This will
    be a short one and we will only be talking about Human Level Performance & Avoidable
    Bias. If you did not read the first chapter, here’s the [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-improve-my-ml-algorithm-lessons-from-andrew-ngs-experience-i-551ca1a32634).
    Let’s get started! Oh and one more thing, this series is entirely based on a recent
    [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/home/welcome) by
    Andrew Ng on Coursera.

- en: In the last few years, a lot more machine learning teams have been talking about
    comparing the machine learning systems to human level performance. Why so?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of advances in deep learning, the algorithms are suddenly working much
    better and have become much more feasible in a lot of application areas for machine
    learning

    efficient when you’re trying to do something that humans can also do

- en: Over time, as you keep training your algorithm, it improves rapidly until it
    passes human level performance. Post which, it improves slowly. Although in no
    case can it surpass some theoretical limit called [Bayes Optimal Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_error_rate),
    the best possible error. In other words, any function’s mapping from x to y can
    not surpass a certain level of accuracy.

- en: Usually, human and Bayes error are quite close, especially for natural perception
    problems, and there is little scope for improvement after surpassing human-level
    performance and thus, learning slows down considerably.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want our algorithm to do well on training set but not too well (leading to
    overfitting). By knowing what the human-level performance is, it is possible to
    tell when a training set is performing well, too well or not well.

    we can know if we need to focus on bias or variance avoidance tactics to improve
    our system’s performance.

- en: The algorithm isn’t fitting well the training set since the target is around
    1% and the bias is 7%. **Use bias reduction techniques** such as training a bigger
    neural network, or running the training set longer, or train better optimization
    algorithms (e.g. Adam’s), or change the NN architecture (use CNN, RNN etc.)
  prefs: []

- en: '***Scenario B:***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The focus here should be to reduce the variance since the variance is 2% as
    compared to the avoidable bias which is just 0.5%. **Use variance reduction techniques**
    such as regularization, or have a bigger training set, tune the hyperparameters
    accordingly etc.

- en: '***Note 1:*** The definition of human-level error depends on the purpose of
    the analysis. Take example of a medical image classification in which the input
    is a radiology image and the output is a diagnosis classification decision. A
    typical human has x% error, a doctor has (x-y) % error and a team of doctors have
    (x-y-z) % error. When taking proxy for Bayes error, you must take (x-y-z) as the
    error %.'
