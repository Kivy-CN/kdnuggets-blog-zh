    repositories that Github has to offer. The post was inspired by the [Github Open
    Data Showcase](https://github.com/showcases/open-data), which is good, but which
    is not very large. Ideally, I would like to make a list of the top open datasets
    on Github, period; however, this gets tricky, since searching for "open data,"
    or any variant of this search term, is going to lead to complications on a site
    set up with the explicit goal of sharing open source projects and their data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I decided to take the offerings in this showcase which were not explicitly noted
    as being out of date and add in 3 additional strictly-dataset repos with the highest
    numbers of stars I could find from simple search, rank them all accordingly, and
    present them here. We have found at KDnuggets that datasets are one of the most
    sought-after pieces of [the data science puzzle](/2016/03/data-science-puzzle-explained.html)
    for many readers, and hopefully this fresh batch (at least, fresh from our perspective)
    is of use to some of our readers.

    Poll](/2016/05/poll-analytics-data-mining-data-science-machine-learning-software-used.html),
    and so the particular percentages from last year may change, but we know that
    open source tools have been used by 73% of data scientists in the past 12 months.
    While this number reflects software, and not data, it is easy to surmise that
    open data is a heavily-relied upon commodity in data science and related data-oriented
    disciplines for research, practice, and production alike, for myriad reasons.

    of the time of writing.

    the undisputed leader of the open dataset collections available on Github. This
    curated list is organized by such topics as biology, sports, museums, and natural
    language, and appears to include several hundred datasets. Most are free, but
    there is a disclaimer at the top of the list that some are not. Xiaming also points
    out 2 other **awesome**-branded repo lists that contain more datasets; however,
    since those lists contain all sorts of other big data/machine learning/data science
    links, they will **not** be included in the list below, despite their high number
    of stars. Feel free to explore them on your own... obviously.

    and zip codes, when combined with geographic coordinates, are the hub that connects
    digital to physical places. Precisely because of their connecting role, free and
    open addresses are rocket fuel for civic and commercial innovation.

    was last updated 20 days ago is encouraging in this respect. The README also points
