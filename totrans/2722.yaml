    a type of anonymized data. Thus, it falls out of the scope of personal data protection
    laws. This, in turn, reduces for organizations the restrictions associated with
    the use of sensitive data while safeguarding individuals’ privacy. It’s particularly
    valuable in heavily regulated industries, as we’ll see through the following use-cases.

- en: More and more, data is becoming the central element driving value and growth
    within enterprises. In almost every data silo, and at every stage of the data
    lifecycle, enterprises have the ability to generate value. However, data hardly
    flows inside organizations, hindered by burdensome compliance and data governance
    processes. As a result, the use of synthetic data stretches along the data lifecycle.
    From data integration to data dissemination, it brings an alternative to leverage
    data.

    stages, enterprises can generate value. However, a large part of the potential
    value remains untapped because of strict privacy regulations.

    processes for enterprises. Assuring data safety, while guaranteeing its integrity
    for upcoming uses, can be time-intensive and costly, when possible at all. Because
    it embeds a privacy-by-design principle, Statice’s synthetic data allows enterprises
    to migrate samples, or complete data assets into cloud environments more easily.
    This saves time and money for enterprises that gain in data agility.

- en: Privacy processes and internal controls slow down and sometimes prevent ideal
    data flows within organizations. Getting internal access to data can take weeks,
    or even longer when it is not clear which data points are required. The use of
    synthetic data samples, or complete datasets, liberates enterprises from the hurdles
    associated with getting sensitive data outside of a given silo. They can share
    internal sources and aggregate data faster, which in turn leads to a greater ability
    to leverage data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The regulation of data retention has been a hot topic in Europe in the last
    decade. Today, the [GDPR insists](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) upon limiting
    how long and how much personal data businesses store. Additionally, national laws
    often regulate the retention for data of a certain nature, such as telecommunications
    or banking information. The problem is that certain analyses require the storage
    of data for a longer period, infringing on such regulations. For example, annual
    seasonality analyses would require at least two years of data. In such cases,
    synthetic data offers a way to comply with data retention laws while enabling
    otherwise impossible long-term analysis.

    of new systems and prevent realistic testing. Here as well, synthetic data offers
    an alternative to production data. Because it mimics the statistical property
    of production data, synthetic data can be used to test new products and services,
    validate models or test performances. This resource is easily and quickly accessible,
    allowing for greater data agility and faster time-to-production in software development.

    and [presents strong re-identification risks](https://www.statice.ai/post/the-truth-about-anonymous-data).
    On the other side, getting systematic consent for secondary use of data is a tedious
    process, especially considering today’s volumes of data and the prevailing consumer
    sentiment toward data processing. Privacy-preserving synthetic data helps balance
    this privacy and utility dilemma. Enterprises can run analysis on synthetic data
    generated in a privacy-preserving way from customer data without privacy or quality
    concerns. In turn, this helps data-driven enterprises take better decisions.

    machine learning models is a challenge in many industries. Using privacy-preserving
    synthetic data to power machine learning models can be a more scalable approach
    that also preserves data privacy. Multiple businesses already [validated the use
    of privacy-preserving machine learning](https://www.statice.ai/post/future-proofing-data-operations-successful-insurance-mobiliere),
    producing meaningful results when building and training models with synthetic
    data. This an opportunity for enterprises to scale the use of machine learning
    and benefits in a secure way.

    synthetic data has been made available into an enterprise warehouse, engineers
    and data scientists can easily access and use it. Enterprises can create and make
    available data repositories that don’t represent a privacy breach, making resources
    available for product and service development. This in turn generates value for
    them as they are able to capitalize on their existing data to develop and innovate.

    synthetic data offers an opportunity to build revenue from data streams that are
    otherwise too sensitive to use for such purposes under normal circumstances. Organizations
    get to build new data-derived revenue streams at will, without risking individual
    privacy.

    today. But whether to share analytics with clients, co-develop products with partners,
    or being able to send data to offshore sites, enterprises often struggle with
    the inherent challenges of sensitive data sharing. To avoid these time-consuming
    processes and increase their agility, enterprises can use privacy-preserving synthetic
    data.

    it is crucial to ensure that no personal information is exposed. The infamous
    Netflix prize case illustrates the risks of releasing poorly anonymized data.
    With privacy-preserving synthetic data, enterprises have a guarantee of safeguarding
    the privacy of individuals.

    the value of data if they want to remain competitive. Privacy-preserving synthetic
    data is a safe and compliant alternative to the use of sensitive data that can
    give enterprises a significant competitive advantage. From internal data sharing
    to data monetization, enterprises can generate additional value, which can be
    decisive in competitive markets.
