  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NoSQL is essentially the response to SQL’s rigid structure. First created in
    the early 1970s, NoSQL didn’t really take off until the late 2000s, when Amazon
    and Google both put a lot of research and development into it. Since then, it’s
    taken off to be an integral part of the modern world, with many big websites around
    the world using some form of NoSQL.

- en: So what is NoSQL exactly? Essentially it is a philosophy for creating databases
    that does *not* require a schema *nor* does it store data in a relational model.
    In fact, NoSQL has a variety of [NoSQL Databases](https://hostingdata.co.uk/nosql-database/)
    to pick from, each with their own specialization and use cases. As such, NoSQL
    is incredibly diverse when it comes to filling niches, and you can almost certainly
    find a NoSQL data model to fit your needs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While SQL *is* a specific database and language, NoSQL isn’t, but that doesn’t
    mean that we can’t look at the general philosophies and differences between the
    two.

- en: Scalability
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to SQL, the only real way to scale is to upgrade vertically. That
    means that you need to buy higher-end and more expensive gear than you already
    have if you want better performance. [Scaling with NoSQL](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2609739/scaling-and-querying-large-nosql-databases.html)
    is done through horizontal expansion, so all you really need to do is throw in
    another shard and you’re basically done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that NoSQL is absolutely great for applications that are likely to
    grow in the future where hardware may very well be a substantial roadblock.

- en: Schema
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL is built from the ground-up to essentially avoid data duplication. That
    ultimately means that any SQL project requires an expert designer to spend a long
    period of time on the schema before implementing it. This step is not only important
    in the long run to maintain [data quality](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/6210/sql-server-best-practices-for-data-quality/),
    it can also get quite expensive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, since NoSQL doesn’t necessitate the need for a schema, you
    avoid the expense and time of that initial design stage. Furthermore, the lack
    of schema means that most NoSQL databases are incredibly flexible, allowing you
    to change or even mix data types and models. This makes administrating and dealing
    with the database much easier.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With SQL, querying data tends to require you to do so across multiple tables.
    With NoSQL, all the data is contained in one table, and therefore querying is
    much easier. This has the side-effect of making [NoSQL much better](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/175542/why-is-nosql-faster-than-sql)
    at dealing with high-performance tasks. For example, Amazon DB can do millions
    of queries a second, which is pretty useful for a global store like Amazon.

- en: The only really big downside when it comes to NoSQL is that it isn’t as established
    as SQL. Keep in mind that SQL has several decades worth of a head start, and this
    maturity shows in the ease with which information can be found. Similarly, finding
    an expert on SQL is much easier than finding one for NoSQL.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, since NoSQL isn’t a singular database or language, but instead several
    dozen data models, this granularity further divides any potential expertise and
    makes NoSQL a matter of specialization. Therefore, reliance for information and
    support will mostly be contained to smaller communities.

- en: This type of data model allows you to store information as any type of data.
    This is in contrast to SQL, which relies heavily on XML and JSON, and essentially
    ties the two together, and can make any query inefficient (or less efficient).
    Since NoSQL doesn’t use a scheme, there’s no need for relational data storage,
    and no need to tie those two together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, there is a NoSQL data model that is XML specific, if you want to go
    that route.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Graph or Network Data models are built around the concept that the relationship
    between the data is just as important as the data itself. In this data model,
    information is stored as relationships and nodes, with the nodes holding the data,
    and the relationship describing the relationship between any set of nodes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the name might suggest, and if you’ve been following along, this is an excellent
    data model to use for showing information on a graph. The ability to quickly visualize
    information from disparate sets of data, especially in relation to each other,
    can offer a massive amount of insight that doesn’t require pouring through several
    hundred pages of data.

- en: '**Key-Value Store**'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the name suggests, this data model stores information using keys and pointers
    to the specific value. Since both keys and values can be any piece of data you
    desire, Key-value store data models are quite versatile. Its purpose made for
    retrieving, storing, and managing arrays and is perfect for high volume applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, Amazon DB is a key-value store data model, and this data model type
    was pioneered by Amazon themselves. A key-value store is also a general category
    under which other data models exist, with some types of graph data-models essentially
    functioning like key-value.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Column-oriented**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas SQL traditionally stores data in rows, Column-oriented stores it in
    columns. These are then grouped into families, which can themselves hold a nearly
    infinite amount of columns. Writing and reading are also done by columns as well,
    so the whole system is really efficient, and is made for fast search & access,
    as well as data aggregation.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing to remember is that NoSQL is not meant as a replacement to SQL so
    much as it's meant to supplement it. [NoSQL itself mostly uses specialized databases](/2016/06/top-nosql-database-engines.html)
    to fill in the gaps that are missing from SQL, and while you absolutely can go
    without SQL if you so chose, NoSQL does not *preclude* the use of it. Sometimes
    you may very well find yourself using both SQL and NoSQL.
