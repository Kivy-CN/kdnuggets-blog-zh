- en: Julia is a high-level, general-purpose language that is designed for high-performance
    calculation. It is getting popular among the data community and researchers due
    to natural language syntax, faster code execution, and a strong machine learning
    ecosystem.

- en: Due to the popularity of the integrated notebooks, data scientists and researchers
    are now running Python, R, Bash, Scala, Ruby, and SQL on the Jupyter Notebook.
    And now, we will learn to install the Julia and set it up for the Jupyter notebook.
    Furthermore, we will load a CSV file and perform time series data visualization.

    running the code in a Jupyter notebook gives us more control over experimentation.
    You can perform data analysis, train machine learning models, or even create a
    Julia package using the notebook.
