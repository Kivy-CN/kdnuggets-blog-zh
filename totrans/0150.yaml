    is only increasing. Why going up? With the recent advancement of generative AI,
    every individual, research group, and company is racing to become the best in
    the field, which makes things more competitive. Although, it’s sometimes hard
    to follow all the latest trends.

    is created. The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence
    (HAI) developed the report with a steering committee from various academic and
    industry fields, and the report's result is intended to give the decision-maker
    and the audience action to advance AI responsibly and ethically.

    in 2022 are spearheaded by the industry field instead of academia. A significant
    machine learning system is a model included in the [Epoch Dataset](https://epochai.org/blog/compute-trends)
    and has specific criteria such as improvement of the state-of-the-art methodology.

    were produced by the industry. We can refer to the chart below to see how the
    trend in 2022 has shifted compared to 2014.

    dataset to see if their model could improve the current benchmark performance.
    For example, the image classification task using [ImageNet dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206848)
