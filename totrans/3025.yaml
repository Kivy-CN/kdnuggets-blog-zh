    accurately to solve their data challenges and enable machine learning (ML). But
    before bringing your data into a machine learning model or any other analytics
    project, it’s important to ensure that it is clean, consistent, and accurate.
    Because much of today’s analytics is dependent on the context of the data, the
    task is best done by those closest to what the data actually represents; the business
    domain expert who can apply hunches, theories, and business knowledge to the data.

- en: Unfortunately, business users don’t usually come equipped with data science
    skills so bridging that gap can make the difference between gaining value from
    your data quickly. As result, many are applying data preparation (DP) to help
    data scientists and ML practitioners rapidly prepare and annotate their enterprise
    data to extend the value of the data across the enterprise for analytic workloads.

    has the ability to train, test, and validate them prior to deploying into production.
    Data preparation technology is being used to create the clean and annotated foundation
    needed for today’s modern machine learning yet, good DP historically takes more
    time than any other part of the machine learning process.

    into one input, such as when you have a collection of files representing daily
    transactions, but your machine learning model needs to ingest a year of data.
    Also, be sure to have a contingency plan in place for overcoming problems associated
    with sampling and bias in your data set and your machine learning model.

- en: Once the data is collected, it’s time to assess the condition of it, including
    looking for trends, outliers, exceptions, incorrect, inconsistent, missing, or
    skewed information. This is important because your source data will inform all
    of your model’s findings, so it is critical to be sure it does not contain unseen
    biases. For example, if you are looking at customer behavior nationally, but only
    pulling in data from a limited sample, you might miss important geographic regions.
    This is the time to catch any issues that could incorrectly skew your model’s
    findings, on the entire data set, and not just on partial or sample data sets.

- en: The next step in great data preparation is to ensure your data is formatted
    in a way that best fits your machine learning model. If you are aggregating data
    from different sources, or if your data set has been manually updated by more
    than one stakeholder, you’ll likely discover anomalies in how the data is formatted
    (e.g. USD5.50 versus $5.50). In the same way, standardizing values in a column,
    e.g. State names that could be spelled out or abbreviated) will ensure that your
    data will aggregate correctly. Consistent data formatting takes away these errors
    so that the entire data set uses the same input formatting protocols.

- en: Here, start by having a strategy for dealing with erroneous data, missing values,
    extreme values, and outliers in your data. Self-service data preparation tools
    can help if they have intelligent facilities built in to help match data attributes
    from disparate datasets to combine them intelligently. For instance, if you have
    columns for FIRST NAME and LAST NAME in one dataset and another dataset has a
    column called CUSTOMER that seem to hold a FIRST and LAST NAME combined, intelligent
    algorithms should be able to determine a way to match these and join the datasets
    to get a singular view of the customer.

    NAME”和“LAST NAME”列，而另一个数据集中有一个名为CUSTOMER的列，似乎包含了合并的FIRST和LAST NAME，智能算法应该能够确定一种匹配这些列并将数据集合并以获取客户单一视图的方法。
- en: For continuous variables, make sure to use histograms to review the distribution
    of your data and reduce the skewness. Be sure to examine records outside an accepted
    range of value. This “outlier” could be an inputting error, or it could be a real
    and meaningful result that could inform future events as duplicate or similar
    values could carry the same information and should be eliminated. Similarly, take
    care before automatically deleting all records with a missing value, as too many
    deletions could skew your data set to no longer reflect real-world situations.

  zh: 对于连续变量，确保使用直方图来查看数据的分布并减少偏斜。务必检查超出接受范围的记录。这些“异常值”可能是输入错误，也可能是真实且有意义的结果，因为重复或类似的值可能携带相同的信息，应该被消除。同样，在自动删除所有缺失值的记录之前要小心，因为过多的删除可能会使数据集失真，不再反映现实世界的情况。

    that better represent a pattern to the learning algorithms. For example, data
    can be decomposed into multiple parts to capture more specific relationships,
    such as analyzing sales performance by the day of the week, not only the month
    or year. In this situation, segregating the day as a separate categorical value
    from the date (e.g. “Mon; 06.19.2017”) may provide the algorithm with more relevant
    information.

  zh: 这一步涉及将原始数据转化为更好地代表模式的特征的艺术与科学。例如，可以将数据分解成多个部分以捕捉更具体的关系，例如按周几分析销售表现，而不仅仅是按月或年。在这种情况下，将日期中的“周一;
    06.19.2017”作为一个单独的分类值可能会为算法提供更相关的信息。

- en: The final step is to split your data into two sets; one for training your algorithm,
    and another for evaluation purposes. Be sure to select non-overlapping subsets
    of your data for the training and evaluation sets in order to ensure proper testing.
    Invest in tools that provide versioning and cataloging of your original source
    as well as your prepared data for input to machine learning algorithms, and the
    lineage between them. This way, you can trace the outcome of your predictions
    back to the input data to refine and optimize your models over time.

  zh: 最后的步骤是将数据拆分为两个集合：一个用于训练算法，另一个用于评估目的。确保选择不重叠的数据子集作为训练集和评估集，以确保适当的测试。投资于提供版本控制和目录功能的工具，这些工具不仅包括原始源数据，还包括用于机器学习算法的准备数据及其之间的关系。这样，你可以追溯预测结果到输入数据，以便随着时间的推移精炼和优化你的模型。
