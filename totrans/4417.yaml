    in 2013 has 3 main areas: Hacking (Programming), Math & Statistics, and Business/Domain
    Knowledge. However, the Data Science field has been evolving at such speed these
    3 areas are no longer sufficient. Now Data Science includes additional areas,
    such as Deep Learning algorithms and Cloud Computing Platforms. More Math knowledge
    (especially Algebra and Calculus) is needed for Deep Learning. The COVID pandemic
    added the demand for Survival Analysis and Epidemiology. Deploying Data Science
    requires understanding of software development, DevOps, and using GitHub, Docker,
    and similar tools.'
