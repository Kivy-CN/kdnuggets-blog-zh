    variables, and thus the same kind of power as deep architectures like DBMs and
    DBNs, but with a big difference: **in SPNs, the probabilistic inference is always
    tractable;** it takes a single pass through the network, and avoids all the difficulties
    and unpredictability of approximate methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo and
    loopy belief propagation. As a result, the learning itself, which in these deep
    models uses inference as a subroutine, also becomes much easier and more scalable.'

    which makes them more interpretable than traditional deep models: sum nodes represent
    subclasses of a class, and product nodes represent subparts of a part. So you
    can look at an SPN for recognizing faces, say, and see what type of nose a given

    There are two reasons I haven''t done it yet. First, I want to do a startup that''s

    that are even more important than the technical ones, which is not a recipe for
    success. In the data science space, it's rare for a startup to be a complete failure,
    just because the acqui-hire value of a company is so high, but if that's all you
