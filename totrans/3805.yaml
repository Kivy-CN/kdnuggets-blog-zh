- en: '*You are a seasoned computer scientist working on systems programming. A data
    science team has approached you to derive a new programming language designed
    and optimized for data-oriented tasks, making it perfectly suitable for data scientists
    to use in their day to day job. Provide a high-level description of this language;
    how it would differ from other popular data science languages such as Python,
    R, and SQL; what features would be most important to such a language; issues that
    a language might have; and anything else you feel would be of importance. Keep
    in mind that its standard libraries and built-in functionality should provide
    the most support possible for day to day data science operations. Write a short
    program to demonstrate the features, syntax, and functionality of this language
    as you perceive it.*'
