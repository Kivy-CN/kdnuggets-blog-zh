    Recruiters look at a resume for 7.4 seconds before making a decision on the candidate.
    So that means you have basically less than 10 seconds to make a good impression.
    10 seconds is not a lot of time; especially when you really want this job.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best format for your resume is reverse-chronological. This means your latest
    work, employment, etc is listed first. This helps recruiters see your current
    skills and what value you can add to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The structure of your resume is very important. You don’t want your resume to
    look messy, and the recruiter gets frustrated and immediately closes it. There
    are many resume templates out there, you can simply search on Google and scan
    for a structure that you like. I have personally used [Zety](https://zety.com/blog/data-scientist-resume-example),
    and believe that it is a great tool for freshers.

    data accuracy’, you can say ‘improving the accuracy of predicted data by 22%’.
    This not only shows the recruiter that you have the skills in improving accuracy
    but also to what extent.
