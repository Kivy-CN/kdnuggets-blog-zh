    large datasets. But how do you work with all of that information? SQL is the solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data lake is a centralized repository that allows for the storage of structured
    and unstructured data at any scale. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming
    language used to communicate with and manipulate databases. It can be used to
    manage data stored in a data lake by querying structured data stored in a relational
    database within the data lake, or by applying a schema to unstructured data stored
    in the data lake and querying it using "schema on read."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using SQL with a data lake enables the combination and analysis of structured
    and unstructured data through a variety of analytics, such as real-time analytics,
    batch processing, and machine learning.

- en: Once you have set up your data lake infrastructure, you can begin loading data
    into it. There are several ways to ingest data into a data lake using SQL, such
    as using a SQL INSERT statement or using a SQL-based ETL (extract, transform,
    load) tool. You can also use SQL to query external data sources and load the results
    into your data lake.
