    Before you charge in, bear in mind that this is geared towards professionals who
    want to display their competency in topics like distributed model training and
    scaling to production.

    you need very in-depth knowledge in six areas, including highly specialized topics
    like permission issues, dataset lineage, and data feasibility.

    If you *do* fit that profile, then this certificate is extremely valuable for
    one simple reason. No one has it yet.

    holders, they’ll have a much easier time landing jobs and getting high salaries
    than if there were 6,000 or 60,000 certificate holders.

    biggest tech companies, it won’t be long until you see these new certifications
    all over the place.

    goes to AWS, which has a [Machine Learning certificate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/) of

    if we head to LinkedIn and search for “AWS Certified Machine Learning” (including
    the quotes), we get almost 2,000 results. Those are only the certified people
    who (1) have a LinkedIn and (2) bothered to add its exact name to their profile.
