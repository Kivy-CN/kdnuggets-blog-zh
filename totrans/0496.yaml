    Engineers. Although they certainly work together amicably and enjoy some overlap
    concerning expertise and experience, the two roles serve quite different purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Essentially, we are differentiating between Scientists who seek to understand
    the science behind their work, and Engineers who seek to build something that
    can be accessed by others. Both roles are extremely important, and at some companies,
    are interchangeable — for example, Data Scientists at certain organizations may
    carry out the work of a Machine Learning engineer and vice versa.

    1) Responsibilities 2) Expertise 3) Salary Expectations.

    to as Blitzstein & Pfister workflow. Blitzstein and Pfister initially created
    the framework to teach students of the [Harvard CS 109](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) course

    In this environment, Data Scientists perform tasks to better understand the data
    so they can build models that will best capture the data’s inherent patterns.
    Once they’ve built a model, the next step is to evaluate whether it meets the
    project's desired outcome. If it does not, they will iteratively repeat the process
    until the model meets the desired outcome before handing it over to the Machine
    Learning Engineers.

    Machine Learning infrastructure that permits them to deploy the models built by
    Data Scientists to a production environment. Therefore, Machine Learning Engineers
    typically work in the development environment which is where they are concerned
    with reproducing the machine learning pipeline built by Data Scientists in the
    research environment. And, they work in the production environment which is where
    the model is made accessible to other software systems and/or clients.

    smaller organizations and startups, merging the roles into one. Thus, some organizations
    have Data Scientists doing the work of Machine Learning engineers and some have
    Machine Learning engineers doing the work of Data Scientists. Only leading to
    more confusion amongst practitioners.

    role.
  prefs: []

- en: Data Scientists are typically extremely good data storytellers. Some would argue
    that this trait makes them much more creative than Machine Learning engineers.
    Another difference is that Data Scientists may use tools like PowerBI and Tableau
    to share insights to the business, and they don't necessarily need to use Machine
    Learning.

- en: Couples that make up for their partner's deficiencies are generally stronger.
    When you think of it like that, the aforementioned expertise may be weak points
    for the Machine Learning engineer, who is expected to have a strong foundation
    in computer science and software engineering. Machine Learning engineers are expected
    to know about Data Structures & Algorithms and understand the fundamental components
    that go into creating deliverable software.

    a good grasp of another programming language like Java, C++, or Julia.

    Engineers are quite different concerning their responsibilities, expertise, and
    earnings. From the majority of interviews I’ve listened to on the topic, many
    say the transition from Data Scientists to Machine Learning Engineer is much harder
    than the transition from Machine Learning Engineer to Data Scientists. This is
    because Data Scientists aren’t usually proficient with software engineering and
    computer science fundamentals which is a big learning curve.
