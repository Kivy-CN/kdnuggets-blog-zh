  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. It is a neural network machine
    learning model which is trained using data on the internet to generate any type
    of text. This sophisticated neural network is used to train large language models
    (LLMs) to simulate human communication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model tracks words in a sequence, allowing it to learn both the context
    and meaning of the language. The GPT model focuses on text-only, allowing it to
    use artificial intelligence to analyze what the user is asking and effectively
    generate text.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It has taken the artificial intelligence world by storm with its conversational
    abilities, contextual information, and more. The model can handle tasks such as
    text summarization, code generation, and provide valuable insight within seconds.

    is next. The model will need an initial prompt text and can continue to produce
    text, using that initial prompt.

    Livestream that OpenAI has been building GPT-4 since they opened the company,
    with the past 2 years focusing on perfecting the new technology. They had to rebuild
    the entire train stack and train the model to see what it was capable of.

    and asking ChatGPT to ‘Summarize the article into a sentence where every word
    begins with ‘G’’. ChatGPT-3.5 naturally failed the task. However, GPT-4 successfully
    outputs exactly what the user asked.
