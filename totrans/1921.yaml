- en: Data Science is a hot sector, obviously. Like most geeky memes, the hot-bed
    of social media is on Twitter. Loads of companies are launching in the space.
    But who are the real influencers? And how do they behave on Twitter? We turned
    to [Marshall Kirkpatrick’s](https://twitter.com/marshallk) influencer mapping
    and marketing tool [Little Bird](http://www.getlittlebird.com/) to pull in a list
    and do some analysis. It’s getting [rave reviews](http://www.walkersands.com/Blog/little-bird-influencer-engagement-tool-review/) as
    a way to gain insights into influencers in networks that are not obvious from
    simple Twitter counts.

- en: Unlike simple follower counts, Little Bird builds a true influencer network
    map by measuring how often influencers retweet other influencers and the density
    of network activity. This goes into what they call their “Influencer Score.” It’s
    not a perfect methodology but its relatively solid as a way of assigning contextual
    relevance values and true influencer status rather than just counting Tweets.

- en: To set Little Bird up to run an influencer graph for your topic, you need to
    feed it a handful of accounts you know are influencers in the area you are focused
    on. We put in six Twitter handles that we knew were serious influencers (including
    Hilary Mason, KDnuggets and DataScienceCentral) and then set LittleBird to work
    doing the network analysis and metrics. Little Bird returned 123 influencers from
    all over the world.*

    spreadsheet exported from Little Bird, I pushed the [data into Silk.co’s online
    data and website publishing platform](http://most-influential-data-science-accounts-on.silk.co/?utm_type=GuestBlog&utm_campaign=KDN&utm_source=LittleBird).
    Here’s what we found.

    of 50 or above. Influencers were relatively well distributed by type including
    practitioners, company accounts, media sources, a VC and even one data science-focused
    NGO.

- en: We looked at Twitter accounts that Little Bird assigned an Insider Score of
    10 or greater. 84% of them were in North America. Europe and EU-region countries
    capture 12%. The upshot? Data Science influence is centered squarely in North
    America.

- en: When mapped in a distribution Insider Scores among influencers show a classic
    “Long Tail” with a small number of highly influential accounts, a slim middle
    of moderately influential accounts, and then a long spate of accounts with significantly
    less influence. In fact, a good portion of the accounts actually an “Insider Score”
    of 0.
