    and so far they have been doing well. However, in the last year, it’s clear to
    say that OpenAI has been taking the lead with ChatGPT, and it was only a matter
    of time before Google came in to try to take the lead again.

- en: Gemini is Google's largest language model, which CEO Pichai initially first
    tested at a conference in June, and is now officially launching to the [public](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#availability).
    So what is so great about Gemini and why does it have ChatGPT shaking in its boots?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gemini is not just a single AI model. It comes in different variations to meet
    different demands. For example, you have the lighter version called [Gemini Nano](https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/pixel-feature-drop-december-2023/)
    which is compatible to run on Android devices. You also have Gemini Pro which
    is using the backbone of Barb and will be used to power a lot of Google AI services.

- en: But it doesn’t end there. You also have Gemini Ultra, which is Google’s most
    capable model and most powerful LLM yet. Gemini Ultra seems to be specifically
    designed for data centers and enterprise applications in particular.

    and operate across different types of information. The LLM can handle different
    types of information such as text, code, images, audio and videos. Multimodality
    at its finest.

    that they fit requirements and have been rigorously evaluated on a variety of
    tasks. It is said that Google’s Gemini Ultra exceeded current state-of-the-art
    results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in LLM research,
    with a whopping score of 90.0%.

    [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) (massive multitask language understanding).
    MMLU combines 57 subjects which include math, history, law, medicine, physics
    and more to test world knowledge as well as problem-solving abilities.

    has is its ability to understand and interact with videos and audio.

    and [Whisper](/2023/06/openai-whisper-api-transcription-translation.html). However,
    Google went one step further with a multisensory model from the beginning. Google
    also mentioned the improvements in coding as it uses a new code-generating system
    called AlphaCode 2, which is said to perform 85% better than other coding competition
    participants.
