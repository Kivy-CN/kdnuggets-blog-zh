- en: As a Senior Data Analyst, my job typically consists of one or two large underlaying
    data research projects with a scattering of “time sensitive” smaller projects
    for different teams. During a typical week, I might make 5–7 charts, write a few
    queries, tweak a few more, and help a coworker debug theirs. I’ll probably post
    1 or 2 internal JIRA tickets and perform a few StackOverflow searches.

    one random adhoc question away from being derailed from the bigger task at hand.
    That is why the best analysts are nimble and fast. They roll with the punches
    and quickly get the menial work out of the way.

- en: The truth is that being a good analyst is all about balancing quality versus
    speed. This manifests itself in finding good tools which help make you more efficient.
    In that given week, I might use a half-dozen different tools and software. And
    if there is one thing that analysts all agree upon, it is that no single tool
    does everything great. That is why one of my biggest pieces of advice to young
    analysts is to **start a collection of online bookmarks**. Get in the habit of
    exporting those bookmarks so you can take them with you when you switch jobs or
    upgrade your computer.

    on a daily basis, and others are situational and rarely used. However, you’ll
    probably need them someday, and when you do — it’ll save you a lot of headaches
    and time.

- en: A table formatter lets you convert a block of copy/pasted data into a much more
    efficient and aesthetically pleasing format. This comes in handy in a variety
    of different ways. Sometimes I send colleagues a quick table through Slack or
    email; other times I paste data into a JIRA ticket. Additionally, a table formatter
    is very useful for posting or answering questions in forums, like Stack Overflow,
    or posting data in your blog. The trick is to choose a monospaced font like Courier
    New for it to line up properly.

    format it to be easier to read and those who like to watch the world burn. Whether
    you want to format someone else’s mess or your own — a SQL Beautifier is essential.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Building visualizations and dashboards are an important part of an analyst’s
    job. Unfortunately, I estimate that about 80% of the charts I make are not actually
    for a dashboard but for answering quick, adhoc questions. Launching a specialized
    application like Tableau or fiddling with Excel is just overkill for many of those
    tasks. Instead, I need something that can build a chart quickly.
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are plenty of online resources for building quick graphs, but [https://app.rawgraphs.io/](https://app.rawgraphs.io/) is
    my favorite. I like it because it has a wide range of lesser-known chart types
    (like Calendar heatmap and Circle Packing) that otherwise take too long to figure
    out in Excel.

- en: Most analysts have not actually memorized the syntax for every type of transformation
    under the sun. Rather, most will recall a previous query that did something similar,
    and they’ll dig through their folder of `Untitled1.sql`, `Untitled2.sql`, and `Copy
    of RevenueQuery_final_final_final(3).sql` until they find it. Alternatively, Google
    can come to the rescue, but this requires loads of time trying to find the correct
    question on forums or a tutorial with the correct syntax.
  id: totrans-35

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, bookmark yourself a good SQL Generator. A SQL Generator is basically
    a template for a SQL query, which lets you customize column names and table structure,
    choose the operation that you want to do, and then it constructs the syntax for
    you in a variety of different “flavors” of SQL.

    Having a toolkit available that helps you cut corners without sacrificing quality

    bookmarks folder of “Tools,” hopefully, this article gives you a good starting
    point!
