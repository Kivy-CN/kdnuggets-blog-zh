    These methods are basis for extracting useful knowledge from data, and also serve
    as a foundation for many well known algorithms in data science. I won’t be getting
    into the mathematical details of these methods; rather I am going to focus on
    how these methods are used to solve data centric business problems.

    individual in a population, to which class does this individual belongs to. Generally
    the classes are independent of each other. An example for a classification problem
    would be:'

    Your goal for classification task is given a new individual; determine which class
    that individual belongs to. A closely related concept is scoring or class probability
    estimation.

- en: A Scoring model when applied to an individual produces a score representing
    the probability that the individual belongs to each class. In our customer response
    example, a scoring model can evaluate each individual customer and produce a score
    of how likely each customer is to respond to the offer.

- en: 'Regression is the most commonly used method in forecasting. Regression tries
    to predict a real valued output (numerical value) of some variable for that individual.
    An example regression problem would be: “What will be the cost of a given house?”
    The variable to be predicted here is housing price, and a model could be produced
    by looking at other, similar houses in the population and their historical prices.
    A regression procedure produces a model that, given a house, estimates the price
    of the house.'

    terms, classification forecasts whether something will happen, while regression
    forecasts how much something will happen.

    problem because the underlying target (value you are attempting to predict) is
    categorical”'

    Similarity matching**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarity matching tries to recognize similar individuals based on the information
    known about them. If two entities (products, services, companies) are similar
    in some way they share other characteristics as well.

- en: For example, Accenture will be interested in finding customers who are similar
    to their existing profitable customers, so that they can launch a well targeted
    marketing campaign. Accenture use similarity matching based on the characteristics
    that define their existing profitable customers (such as company turnover, industry,
    location.. etc) .

- en: Similarity is the underlying principle for making product recommendations (identifying
    people who are alike in terms of the products they have purchased or have liked).
    Online retailers such as Amazon and Flipkart use similarity to provide recommendations
    of similar products to you. Whenever you see expressions like “People who like
    A also like B” or “people with your browsing history have also looked at …..”
    The concept of similarity is being applied.
