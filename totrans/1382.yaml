- en: The role of a data scientist has been expanding for years. It went from crunching
    numbers with statistics to building scalable databases to building production
    ready machine learning or deep learning models. Biostatistics and Epidemiology
    are highly specialized fields of statistics that universities offer different
    degrees for them.

- en: Biostatisticians use statistical techniques that your current everyday data
    scientists have probably never heard of. This is a great example where lack of
    domain knowledge exposes you as someone that does not know what they are doing
    and are merely hopping on a trend. While it is known among the community to build
    a prediction model to see who is more likely to have survived the titanic or classify
    an iris plant to being your data science journey, perhaps more caution should
    be given to more serious matters such as a global pandemic that is killing hundreds
    of thousands and potentially millions of people.

- en: Epidemiology is the study of the frequency and distribution of diseases within
    human populations and environments. Epidemiology is an important aspect of public
    health as it relates to the understanding of a disease in the population and assess
    its risk. Typically epidemiologists have an experienced science background in
    areas such as biology, medicine and virology etc. This is how an epidemiologist
    builds their domain knowledge to actually be able to understand what they are
    modelling.

- en: Biostatistics is the application of statistical techniques to scientific research
    in health-related fields, including medicine, epidemiology, and public health.
    Someone who has a degree in statistics could probably become an analyst with data
    from retail, demographics, real estate, economics, finance etc. The biological
    sciences are a whole different space and require a separate qualification altogether.

- en: Now a data scientist could come from a non statistical/mathematical background
    and suddenly start modelling disease data to show their skills. This is not the
    right type of data to to show your knowledge. It is up to each individual to know
    whether they have the ability to properly handle the data. So much false and misleading
    content has been published that further stains the profession of a data scientist
    as it shows that there are still people who are ignorant to the data and only
    care about using a random forest of xgboost model from Python instead of R (because
    R is not as cool apparently as it once was to some people) and promote it on LinkedIn
    hoping a recruiter or a senior data scientist will be impressed.

- en: For example, forecasts of tomorrow’s stock prices are much less accurate because
    factors 1 and 3 above are not satisfied. First, the factors that contribute to
    changes in stock prices are not particularly well understood and depend at least
    partly on human psychology. Second, well-publicised forecasts of the stock market
    can directly affect the behaviour of many investors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The above 3 factors are not all applicable to diseases but we can see how number
    2 is a problem because of underestimation of the actual number of cases. The second
    problem is that the forecasts of COVID-19 can affect the thing we are trying to
    forecast because governments are reacting, some better than others. A simple model
    using the available data will be misleading unless it can incorporate the various
    steps being taken to slow transmission.

    infection process. The simplest models are based on classifying living individuals
    in the population as Susceptible, Infectious or Recovered – hence they are called
    SIR models.

    is our responsibility to realize where our talents are to be used and when to
    take a step back and let the actual experts lead the charge. Infectious disease
    modelling is just too much of a specialized and sensitive area to blindly give
    your two cents. We need to be aware of the situations when we are needed and when
    we are not needed.
