    conference in Boston where I was on a Panel discussion moderated by Gregory Piatetsky
    of KDnuggets, I was asked a question as to where we see investment opportunities
    in the Big Data landscape.

- en: This post will expand on some of my comments from the conference. Importantly,
    the lens through which I make these observations is from our role as a seed and
    early stage venture capital investor, which means we are looking at where market
    opportunities will develop over the next 3-5 years, not necessarily where the
    market is today.

    flowed into Big Data infrastructure companies that help organizations store, manage
    and analyze unprecedented levels of data. The recipients of this capital include
    Hadoop vendors such as Cloudera, HortonWorks and MapR; NoSQL database providers
    such as MongoDB (a Flybridge portfolio company where I sit on the board), DataStax
    and Couchbase; BI Tools, SQL on Hadoop and Analytical framework vendors such as
    Pentaho, Jaspersoft, Datameer and Hadapt.

    and Informatica are plowing significant R&D and M&A resources into Big Data infrastructure.
    The private companies are attracting capital and the larger companies are dedicating
    resources to this market given an overall market that is both large, ($18B in
    spending in 2013 by [one estimate](http://wikibon.org/wiki/v/Big_Data_Vendor_Revenue_and_Market_Forecast_2013-2017))

    infrastructure market today, on a forward looking basis, we believe the winners
    in these markets have largely been identified and well-capitalized and that opportunities
    for new companies looking to take advantage of these Big Data trends lie elsewhere,
    specifically in what we at Flybridge call Full-Stack Analytics companies.

    are the concepts of **actionable insights** and **data network effects**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the concepts of **actionable insights**, one of the recurring themes we hear
    from CIOs and Line of Business Heads at large companies is that they are drowning
    is data, but suffering from a paucity of insights that change decisions they make.
    As a result, it is critical to boil the data down into something that can be acted
    upon in a reasonable time frame to either help companies generate more revenue,
    serve their customers better or operate more efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the **data network effects**, one of the most important opportunities for
    Full-Stack Analytics companies is to use machine learning techniques (an area
    my partner, Jeff Bussgang, [has written about](http://bostonvcblog.typepad.com/vc/2012/05/forget-plastics-its-all-about-machine-learning.html))
    to develop a set of insights that improve over time as more data is analyzed across
    more customers – in effect, learning the business context with greater data exposure
    to drive better insights and, therefore, better decisions. This provides both
    an increasingly more compelling solution and also allows the company to develop
    competitive barriers that get harder to surmount over time – i.e., creates a network
    effect where the more data you ingest, the more learning ensues which leads to
    better decisions and opportunities to ingest yet even more data.
