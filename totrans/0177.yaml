- en: '**ChatOps** stands for Chat Operations. It is the use of chatbots, chat clients
    or other real-time communication tools which help in facilitating software development
    and operational tasks. It is the automation of these operational tasks and some
    of these ChatOps have control of a company''s entire infrastructure.'

    to provide a collaboration platform. This allows teams to communicate more effectively
    and have better management of their workflow. Examples of popular collaboration
    platforms are Slack and Microsoft Team.

    such as emails to business chat tools, allowing an application to take on these
    tasks and take the workload off employees.

    tools, such as chatbots.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now you’re probably wondering why I put LMOps in the title, right? Using
    data and statistical tests, chatbots have the ability to predict the probability
    of a sequence of words. They are built on language models. Hence the LMOps (Language
    Model Operations).

    human language, and how it can communicate back to the customer.
  prefs: []

    it depends on what you’re using it for. If you are using ChatOps to help with
    customer interactions, engagement, call centers, etc - you will need NLP. It allows
    for ChatOps tools to answer as many questions as possible, with accuracy.

    and externally. With the recent advances of LLMs, there is a high chance they

    were held in a repository, it can be computerized in a centralized communication
    platform. ChatOps tools can then execute tasks and operations which can be repetitive
