- en: My name is Pau Labarta Bajo. I am a freelance data scientist and ML engineer
    who works as a remote freelancer for the last 2+ years. Before, I used to work
    as a data scientist in a top mobile gaming company, Nordeus. Around me, I had
    a crew of great data scientists and amazing data engineers. By the time I joined
    the team, they had already built the data analytics platform in-house that helped
    the company manage a game with over 2M daily active users. I felt I was another
    bee operating inside a well-established swarm. 90% of my time was spent on technical
    stuff, including data analysis to improve the product and ML development to increase
    its efficiency. 10% of the time was on communicating to the rest of the team what
    I was working on.

    The transition has been both challenging and incredibly enriching. On the way,
    I have collected a few learnings that I condensed into **4 practical tips**, to
    help you join me and start **walking on the other side**.

    like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) you can see new job postings popping every
    minute. Yes, there are LOTS of data science jobs, which is something you should
    be thankful for every morning. However, there is also a lot of competition on
    those huge sites. Freelancers from all over the world try to fish in the same
    pond as you.

    project, I was working with another data engineer in the same time zone, whose
    salary more than doubled mine. He was working freelance for the first time. Countless
    times I regretted my *smart* pricing.

    Yours is a highly qualified job, and excessive price discounts are also interpreted
    as higher uncertainty on the project’s success. Also, keep in mind you are trying
    to convince another human, not a cost-minimizing android. You need to show confidence,
    and setting a lower price than what you think you are worth is the opposite of
    that.

    Toptal, and Braintrust), but feel free to explore others as well.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Volume-based platforms**, like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/). There are
    no entry barriers both for clients and freelancers. Anyone can publish a job,
    and anyone can register as a freelancer. It is a good place to find small projects,
    but quite hard to get good clients when you start. Good jobs are usually open
    only to applicants who have built a reputation inside the platform through previous
    projects. This puts you at a disadvantage and can frankly get quite frustrating
    when you start. Nonetheless, I suggest you create a profile in Upwork. Upwork
    clients can find your profile through a search inside the platform and directly
    ask you to send a proposal. This is an option you have to leave open.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Quality-based platforms**, like [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/Bxdpg6/worlds-top-talent)
    or [Braintrust](https://app.usebraintrust.com/r/pau1/). They have fewer clients
    but with much higher quality. In order to see and apply for projects inside these
    platforms, you need to pass a screening process. It takes around 2 to 5 weeks
    to complete it. It is time and energy-consuming, but the payoff is immense. Being
    inside these platforms gives you the opportunity to connect with great clients,
    usually startups and big enterprises, who are willing to pay higher rates for
    the quality that Toptal promises them. Do not be scared by their “only top 3%”
    policy. I can safely say that I was not a “top 3% machine learning engineer” when
    I joined Toptal 2 years ago.'

    can build a pretty dashboard in Tableau. Can you?”*. This was not the most exciting
    job I could think of, but something I had done thousand times in my previous job.
    I was an expert in that, and this is what has value for the client.

    But she is not your mom or dad. He wants to get the problem solved, so go straight
    to the point. Focus on the problem from the first paragraph, without preambles
    and presentations that can only make her yawn. Use bullet points to enumerate
    very specific things that are directly related to the problem and to decrease
    the cognitive load. Also, keep BS to the minimum. Do you enjoy reading how someone
    else praises herself? Same for your potential client.
