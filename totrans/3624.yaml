- en: MLOps refers to [machine learning operations](https://ml-ops.org/). It is a
    practice that aims to make machine learning in production efficient and seamless.
    While the term MLOps is relatively nascent, it draws comparisons to DevOps in
    that it’s not a single piece of technology but rather a shared understanding of
    how to do things the right way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The [shared principles](https://valohai.com/mlops/) MLOps introduces encourage
    data scientists to think of machine learning not as individual scientific experiments
    but as a continuous process to develop, launch, and maintain machine learning
    capabilities for real-world use. Machine learning should be collaborative, reproducible,
    continuous, and tested.

- en: 'The practical implementation of MLOps involves both adopting certain best practices
    and setting up an infrastructure that supports these best practices. Let’s look
    at three ways that MLOps changes how machine learning is developed: its implications
    for version control, how to build in safeguards, and the need to focus on the
    machine learning pipeline.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to utilizing machine learning within an organization, version
    control should be a top priority. However, this concept does not apply just to
    the code that drives the models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning version control should cover the code, underlying data, and
    parameters used when training the algorithm. This process is vital to ensure scalability
    and [reproducibility](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-confronts-reproducibility-crisis/).

    [The reproducibility checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf)
    serves as a good starting point to what your MLOps setup should be able to document.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, let's discuss version control within the code since most data scientists
    are comfortable with it. Whether it is the implementation code used for system
    integration or the modeling code that allows you to develop machine learning algorithms,
    there should be clear documentation of any changes made. This area is most often
    well covered by the use of Git, for example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Version control should also be applied to the data used to train the models.
    Scenarios and users are constantly changing and adapting, so it makes sense that
    your data will not always look the same either.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This constant change means that we always have to retrain models and validate
    that they are still accurate with new data. As a result, proper version control
    is needed to maintain reproducibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only does the data we use to build models evolve, but so does the metadata.
    Metadata refers to information collected about the underlying data and the model
    training – it tells us how your model training process went. Was the data used
    as expected? What kind of accuracy did the model reach?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The metadata can change even when the underlying data has not. Metadata needs
    to be tightly versioned because you’ll want to have a benchmark for subsequent
    times you train models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, there must be proper version control for the model itself. As a data
    scientist, your goal is to continuously improve machine learning models’ accuracy
    and reliability, so the evolving algorithm needs to have its own versioning. This
    is often referred to as a model registry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The MLOps practice encourages version control for all components mentioned above
    as a standard practice, and most MLOps platforms make this easy to implement.
    With proper version control, you ensure reproducibility at all times, which is
    crucial for governance and knowledge sharing.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to building safeguards into the machine learning process, they
    should be in the code – not in your head!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Strive to avoid manual or inconsistent processes at all costs. All procedures
    for collecting data, data testing, and model deployment should be written into
    the code – rather than process documentation – so that you can be confident that
    every iteration of a model will adhere to the required standards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the way that you train a machine learning model matters – a lot.
    As a result, any small variation in how a model is trained can lead to problems
    and inconsistencies in the predictions it makes. This risk is why it is essential
    to build these safeguards directly into the code.

- en: '*Data testing is often done in an ad-hoc way, but it should be programmatic.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There should be code written into the machine learning pipeline that safeguards
    [how the training data should look (pre-train tests) and how the trained model
    should perform (post-train tests)](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/testing-ml/). This
    includes having parameters for what the expected predictions should be – this
    will give you peace of mind that the production models are following all of the
    rules you set forth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The great thing about implementing an MLOps platform is that all of these steps
    are self-documenting and reusable – at least to the level that code is self-documenting.
    The safeguards can be easily repurposed for other machine learning use-cases,
    and the same standards, e.g., model accuracy, can be applied.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third MLOps concept that should be recognized is that the machine learning
    pipeline is the product – not the model itself. This realization is often characterized
    by a maturity model where an organization moves from a [manual process to an automated
    pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning).

    is to enable a self-healing ML system.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The machine learning model is important to overcome business challenges and
    satisfy the organization’s immediate needs. However, it is necessary to [acknowledge
    the model is only temporary, unlike the system that produces it](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/forget-the-models-you-need-a-machine-learning-pipeline/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The underlying data that supports the model will change rapidly, and the model
    will drift. This means that eventually, the model will have to be retrained and
    adjusted to provide accurate outcomes in a new environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result, the pipeline that produces accurate and effective machine learning
    models should be the product that data scientists focus on creating. So, what
    exactly is a machine learning pipeline?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without MLOps and an established machine learning pipeline, updated the models
    will be time-consuming and difficult. Rather than completing these tasks ad-hoc
    and only addressing issues as they arise, a pipeline eliminates this problem.
    It lays out a clear framework and governance for model updates and changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The machine learning pipeline includes collecting and preprocessing data, training
    a machine learning model, moving it into production, and continuously monitoring
    it to re-trigger training when accuracy falters. A well-built pipeline helps you
    scale this process throughout your organization so that you can maximize the use
    of production models and ensure these capabilities always perform up-to-par.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A developed machine learning pipeline also allows you to exercise control over
    how models are implemented and used within the business. It also improves communication
    across departments and will enable others to review the pipeline – rather than
    manual workflows – to determine if changes need to be made. Similarly, it reduces
    production bottlenecks and allows you to make the most out of your data science
    capabilities.

    understand.

    This includes not just code but data, parameters and metadata as well.
