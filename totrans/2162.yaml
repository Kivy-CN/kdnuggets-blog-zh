- en: In case you hadn’t already heard it, OpenAI recently announced that fine-tuning
    for GPT-3.5 Turbo is available. Furthermore, fine-tuning for GPT-4.0 is expected
    to be released later in the fall as well. For developers in particular, this has
    been most welcome news.

- en: But why precisely was this such an important announcement? In short, it’s because
    fine-tuning a GPT-3.5 Turbo model offers several important benefits. While we’ll
    explore what these benefits are later in this article, in essence, fine-tuning
    enables developers to more effectively [manage their projects](/2023/08/7-beginnerfriendly-projects-get-started-chatgpt.html)
    and shorten their prompts (sometimes by up to 90%) by having instructions embedded
    into the model itself.

    Chat GPT-3.5 capabilities for certain tasks. Let’s explore how you can fine-tune
    your GPT-3.5 Turbo models in greater depth.

    their customized models follow specific instructions better. For example, if you’d
    like your model to be completed [in a different language](https://www.mlyearning.org/languages-supported-by-chatgpt/#:~:text=ChatGPT%2C%20being%20a%20large%20language,to%20support%20over%2050%20languages.)
    (such as Italian or Spanish), fine-tuning your models enables you to do that.

- en: Thanks to fine-tuning, a model can improve its ability to format responses in
    a consistent way. This is very important for any applications that require a specific
    format, such as coding. Specifically, developers can fine-tune their models so
    that user prompts are converted [into JSON snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets),
    which can then be incorporated into larger data modules later on.

- en: If any businesses need to ensure that the output generated by their AI models
    are completed with a specific tone, fine-tuning is the most efficient way to ensure
    that. Many businesses need to ensure their content and marketing materials match
    their brand voice or have a certain tone as a means to better connect with customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If any business has a recognizable brand voice, they can fine-tune their GPT-3.5
    Turbo models when preparing their data for fine-tuning. Specifically, this will
    be done in the ‘user message’ and ‘system message’ message types as discussed
    above. When done properly, this will result in all messages being created with
    the company’s brand voice in mind, while also significantly reducing the time
    needed to edit everything from social media copy to whitepapers.

    Beyond that, the company is expected to release upcoming features such as [offering
    support for function calling](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/finetuning/openai_fine_tuning_functions.html)
    and the ability to fine-tune via the UI. The latter will make fine-tuning more
    accessible for novice users.

    for businesses as well. For instance, many of the [most promising startups](https://www.atlantic.net/dedicated-server-hosting/most-promising-start-ups-to-watch-in-2023/)
    in the tech and developer space, such as Sweep or SeekOut, are reliant on using
    AI for completing their services. Businesses such as these will find good use
    in the ability to fine-tune their GPT data models.
