But there are also violent and upsetting scenes, particularly the death of a main character, which make it too intense for younger kids. There's also one graphic-for-its-time sex scene (though no explicit nudity) and quite a few shirtless men in locker rooms and, in one iconic sequence, on a beach volleyball court. Winning is the most important thing to all the pilots, who try to intimidate one another with plenty of posturing and banter -- though when push comes to shove, loyalty and friendship have important roles to play, too. While sexism is noticeable and almost all characters are men, two strong women help keep some of the objectification in check.\"\n\nsummarizer(input, min_length=5, max_length=30) \n```", "```py\n[\n    {\n        \"summary_text\": \"1980s action thriller starring Tom Cruise is chock-full of escapes, chases, battles \"\n    }\n] \n```", "```py\nqa_pipeline = pipeline(model=\"deepset/roberta-base-squad2\")\n\nqa_pipeline(\n    question=\"Where do I work?\",\n    context=\"I work as a Data Scientist at a lab in University of Montreal.
