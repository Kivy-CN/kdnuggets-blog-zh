    describing data science as an oversaturated field. The article predicted that
    ML engineers would replace data scientists in the upcoming years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to the author of this article, most companies worked to solve very
    similar business problems with data science. Due to this, it wouldn’t be necessary
    for data scientists to come up with novel methods of solving problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The author went on to say that only basic data science skills were required
    in order to solve problems in most data-driven organizations. This role could
    easily be replaced by a machine learning engineer — a person with basic knowledge
    of data science algorithms, who also possessed knowledge of deploying ML models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have read many similar articles in the past year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    like AutoML, while others refer to data science as a “dying field” that will soon
    be surpassed by roles like data engineering and ML operations.

- en: The data science workflow within most organizations is pretty similar. Many
    companies hire data scientists to solve similar business problems. Most of the
    models built don’t require you to come up with novel solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    organizations have most likely already been used before, and you can borrow inspiration
    from the sea of resources available online.

    modelling even easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I use DataRobot for some business use-cases, and it is a great tool. It iterates
    over many values and chooses the best possible parameters for your model, to ensure
    that you end up with the most highly accurate model possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if predictive modelling has become easier over time, why do companies still
    require data scientists? Why don’t they just use a combination of automated tools
    and ML engineers to manage their entire data science workflow?

    highly complex algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The role of a data scientist is to add value to an organization with data. And
    in most companies, only a very small portion of this involves building ML algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, there will always be problems that cannot be solved by automated tools.
    These tools have a fixed set of algorithms you can pick from, and if you do find
    a problem that requires a combination of approaches to solve, you will need to
    do it manually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And although this doesn’t happen often, it still does — and as an organization,
    you need to hire people skilled enough to do this. Also, tools like DataRobot
    can’t do data pre-processing or any of the heavy lifting that comes before model
    building.

    alike, the situation is very different from what it’s like dealing with Kaggle
    datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no fixed problem. Usually, you have a dataset, and you are given a
    business problem. It is up to you to figure out what to do with customer data
    to maximize sales for the company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that it isn’t just technical or modelling skills that is required
    from a data scientist. You will need to connect the data with the problem at hand.
    You need to decide on external data sources that can optimize your solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data pre-processing is long and painstaking, and not just because it requires
    strong programming skills, but because you need to experiment with different variables
    and their relevance to the problem at hand.

    might suffice to perform a task like customer ranking. Only some problems require
    you to actually come up with a prediction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of the day, the value a data scientist provides to an organization
    lies in their ability to apply data to real-world use cases. Whether it’s building
    a segmentation model, recommendation system, or evaluating customer potential,
    there is no real benefit to an organization unless the results are interpretable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and bridge the gap between technical and business skills, the role will continue
    to persist.
