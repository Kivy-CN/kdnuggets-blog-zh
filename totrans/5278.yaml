    well as to DELETE records. With an understanding of this growing collection of
    commands, suddenly much of what could be referred to as *regular data management
    and query* is attainable (with practice, of course).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On to some slightly more advanced SQL topics. First, we have a look at views,
    which can be thoughts of as virtual tables populated by the results of queries,
    useful for a number of different scenarios including application development,
    data security, and eased data sharing.

    a "nice to have." Since the focus is likely to be more on data exploration, I
    would say that the next topic, joins, is a "must have."

    will cover while learning SQL is getting them straight. That's really more of
    a testament to the ease of SQL than the actual difficulty of learning about joins.

    create and manage some tables, make a view if you had to, and even use joins in
    some more complex querying. But why are you learning all this again? For data
    science, right? Let's take a bit of a break from the technical to get an idea
    of this very topic.

- en: Often we will find that SQL is embedded in, or called from within, software
    written in other programming languages as part of a larger system. For example,
    in web development you may find PHP or Ruby or some other language making calls
    to a database via SQL to input, modify, or retrieve application-related data.
    In data science, you may see SQL being called as part of some application written
    in, perhaps, Python or R. To that end, having an understanding of how these languages
    play with SQL is not a bad idea.
