  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have spoken about how Kaggle competitions help your learning journey and
    how aspects of it reflect what happens in the real world. But is it useful for
    real-world problems? The overall answer is no. Let me explain why in different
    aspects.
  prefs: []

- en: Identifying the Problem
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a data scientist or machine learning engineer, your first task is to identify
    the problem or understand the current business problem that needs to be solved.
    For example, you may need to distinguish if the type of problem is supervised
    or unsupervised, decide which model you will use, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the most important decisions you are going to make. If you don’t
    have an overall understanding of the organization, it will make your life harder
    as you cannot identify the root problem.

    what you are evaluating.'

- en: Data Preparation
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Kaggle competitions, the host of the contest provides you with prepared
    datasets along with a detailed description of the problem at hand. This saves
    data scientists a lot of time going out to collect, clean and structure data -
    which happens in the real world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some believe that Kaggle spoon-fed new data scientists and machine learning
    engineers with provided data, allowing them to get straight to work. Data preparation
    is an important phase in the data science lifecycle, and Kaggle has shown to do
    it all for users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the real world, your company may or may not provide you with data. If they
    have not, you will have to collect it yourself, ensure it aligns with the problem
    at hand, and clean and structure it. You are also freely allowed to look for additional
    relevant data, whereas on Kaggle you are restricted to using outside data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have got your data and it’s all shiny clean, your next step as a data
    scientist is to go in and become a feature engineer. Feature engineering is rooted
    in your problem at hand, what you are trying to solve and how you are going to
    solve it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this, you will have a better understanding of how much time you will spend
    on feature engineering, and if other elements of the data science lifecycle are
    more important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, in Kaggle competitions, feature engineering plays a big role in where
    you end up on the leaderboard. Yes, feature engineering is part of the data science
    lifecycle, but real-world data science projects focus more on the factor that
    drives your model, rather than small incremental gains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    at hand and where your focus is.'

    of the model, the data you are using, the performance of the model, and bringing
    the model to production. These are all in line with your problem at hand, as it
    is down to you to determine which one fits your business's needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas on Kaggle, users are more concerned about which model performs the best
    and processes the data they are working with. The factors that are taken into
    consideration when choosing their model are far less realistic than what is dealt
    with in the real world.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Validation is an aspect that both Kaggle and the real world show resemblance.
    Validating the performance of your model is an important aspect as it allows you
    to explore where you can make changes to improve your model and shows you if your
    model has value in the real world.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the real world, the majority of models you are building are aimed to move
    into production. This is because there is a purpose behind your model, you were
    trying to solve a real-world problem. Your model will one way or another find
    its way to be integrated into the business process to help in future decision
    making.

    concern is where you ranked on the leaderboard and not how your model will be

- en: Kaggle teaches you a lot. Through Kaggle competitions and working on different
    tasks and datasets, you can learn a lot. Personally, I don’t believe there is
    any harm in learning more and coming across challenges. You just learn how to
    overcome these challenges by reflecting on your weaknesses and how to turn them
    into strengths.

    your learning journey. As stated in the screenshot above, you could assume that
    the performance of your model is really good, only to realize that it wasn’t as
    good as others in the same competition.

    Deadlines help you keep on top of your tasks which are in line with the organization's
    business plan. Every deadline is the start of a new project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    could typically look like. This is a great way to understand how your time is
    used as well as overcoming procrastination.

- en: Based on the points we went over, the usefulness of Kaggle competitions is purely
    down to individuals. Yes, every aspect of a Kaggle competition may not mirror
    what happens in the real world, but many of us can say that about some of the
    things we learned at school.
  prefs: []

    you to explore skills you may have never targeted before. There is a lot of experience
    that can come out of Kaggle competitions which can be used in your career later
    on.
