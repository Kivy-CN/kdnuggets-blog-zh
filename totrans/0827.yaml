    Processing) systems play a pivotal role in data processing. OLAP systems enable
    businesses to perform complex data analysis and drive business decisions. OLTP
    systems, on the other hand, ensure that everyday operations run smoothly. They
    handle real-time transactional processes while maintaining data consistency.

    properties, guaranteeing reliable and consistent transactions. OLTP systems are
    typically for applications requiring rapid and concurrent handling of small, fast,

    volumes of historical data*, often requiring significant storage capacity and
    computational resources.

    By storing pre-aggregated and redundant data, these systems can efficiently handle
    complex analytical queries without the need for extensive joins. The denormalized
    structure accelerates data retrieval, but it may lead to increased storage requirements.

    star or snowflake schemas, where data is organized into dimensions and measures.
    Fundamental to all OLAP systems is the *OLAP cube* that facilitates multi-dimensional
    data analysis. **But what is an OLAP cube?**

    aggregations, sorting, grouping, and calculations. These queries often span large
    volumes of historical data and require significant computational resources. Due
