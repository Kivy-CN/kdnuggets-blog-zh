    mathematics. In short, you have stopped progressing in your career. This is the
    slowest way to learn machine learning (ML), where we take multiple courses, learn
    mathematics, work on sample projects and eventually apply for a Job. It will cost
    you more than a year and eventually you will lose interest.

    then jumping right into solving machine learning challenges. In this blog, I am
    going to show you how I learned multiple domains (NLP, Computer Vision, ASR, RL,
    GAN) in machine learning just by participating in the competitions.

    for Education](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/46/box-plots-for-education-reboot/)
    challenge which taught me important skills of data manipulation, using logistic
    regression, and how to create SKlearn pipelines. It took me 12 days just to submit
    my first solution and after that, I used all my energy in improving the model
    performance metric which helped me reach 7th rank in the world. My second competition
    was on [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)
    and trust me I was bad at text classification but I put my time and energy into
    learning different techniques. After my second competition, I was over the moon
    of learning multiple domains, so I started participating in [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/)
    and other competitive platforms.'

    problem and try to figure out solutions together. This also means 3000+ teams
    are involved in solving a single problem. Collaborative learning also helps you
    understand what works for certain problems. You are also keeping up with the new
    trend and eventually, it’s preparing you for your future job as an ML engineer.

    in a team also prepares you for real-life scenarios where the work will be divided
    among members within the data team. Most people say why can’t you Google a solution,
    but in my opinion, talking to your teammates and coming up with a solution is
    an effective way of solving problems.

    motivate you to work hard in achieving the top ten. When I started working on
    [AI4D Baamtu Datamation — Automatic Speech Recognition in WOLOF — Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai4d-baamtu-datamation-automatic-speech-recognition-in-wolof),
    I had no idea how to process the audio or how to train the model on GPU, but after
    2 months of learning from blogs, YouTube, and GitHub projects I was able to reach
    1st rank. This made me realize that I can learn anything. After this I have gained
    enough self-confidence to try new things and learn more tools. If I followed the
    [ASR](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/speech_reco/) online course,
    it would have taken me four months to learn and another four months to get better
    at it.

    skills to deal with unstructured data such as audio, video, or text. Either you
    will learn by taking multiple specialization courses which might take more than
    a year to learn or you can participate in various competitions with different

    various technologies, so it’s better to participate in current competitions that
    are solving current problems within an organization or company. You get to play
    around with production-ready data and learn various techniques to process the
    data.

    other people’s solutions or asking questions on forums. The only thing that is
    stopping you to learn faster is your comfort zone and lack of awareness. I have
