    They are able to utilize small but mighty teams with a can-do attitude and deliver
    product features quickly to the market. At the same time, in order to maintain
    rapid expansion, they have a tangible incentive to pay just as much attention
    to setting up the fundamental practices for sustainable growth. This means managing
    digital transformation to take advantage of the benefits of new technology, and
    managing increasing simultaneous and interconnected projects. Not to mention that
    at the intersection of all these projects and processes, there is often a lot
    of data zipping around! As data grows exponentially, this unique position can
    be leveraged to craft a robust, long term data strategy.

    In this context, business relationships can quickly become complex, and identifying
    patterns and behaviors around your data can become incrementally challenging.
    If you are regularly starting new projects that are deeply intertwined with existing
    features and processes at your organization, you are no longer able to build isolated,
    one-off built-from-scratch solutions. Your operation has grown to the point that
    it pays off to have a corporate data strategy. In this article, I will present
    my vision for a cohesive data strategy based on my prior professional experiences.
    While the purpose of this article is not to outline our exact data strategy at
    SSENSE, a lot of the main principles draw inspiration from it.

- en: No matter where you are in your data-driven journey, having a data strategy
    helps unlock the power of data and allows your organization to treat data as a
    critical asset. A data strategy is a plan designed to improve the methods, practices,
    and processes of data used across the organization, and to ensure that data is
    being used in a sustainable and reproducible way. Because data is generated and
    used by diverse business units with different practices and responsibilities,
    having a committee to oversee a data strategy across the organization becomes
    central to business success. Not having a data strategy is okay depending on where
    you are in your journey, but it becomes more likely that different departments
    will solve data issues on their own, resulting in wasted resources, units operating
    in silos, and a growing lack of cohesiveness in the organization. I managed to
    encapsulate that grim possibility in one sentence, so let’s focus on positive
    and constructive ideas henceforth.

    such as: customers, locations, product, transactions, and their relationships.
    In the early stages of an operation, it would have been okay to represent these
    relationships in a relational database schema, but as the various data types,
    processes, and storage formats evolve; it is important to have a managed data
    catalog with definitions, meanings, and relationships to link disparate systems
    together.'

    help to avoid a lot of the problems and complexity of managing and using data
    in organizations. Even so, consolidating the terminology, metadata, and relationships
    under one catalog makes accessing and using data much simpler. For each field
    of data, such a catalog might include definitions, sources, locations, domains,
    use-cases, stakeholders, etc.

- en: Often the idea of data governance seems restricted to users and the analytics
    environment, but in reality, we are using and generating data in every operation.
    Once data is decoupled from the application that created it, the organization
    should define rules of and details for the data so that all stakeholders can understand
    how to make use of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A strong governance model outlines security details, access rights, high-level
    transformation logic, naming conventions, and rules for how the data should be
    used. In a data-driven organization, a strong governance model should not be thought
    of as an overwhelming barrier to entry for users, or as a means to limit access
    to data. Rather, it should empower all members of the organization to use data
    responsibly and effectively.

    this the norm as we seek to take advantage of the benefits of new technology,
    and we cannot ignore that we are generating more and more data in different systems
    across the organization. Data storage is one of the basic capabilities of technology
    stacks. Identifying the right data store for an application or business process
    is important to ensure that the storage technology is used correctly for its purpose.

    make sure that there are practical ways of storing data for business applications,
    while making it easily accessible and shareable to all interested parties.

    warehouses, etc., should be made on a case-by-case basis, to best fit the needs

    mine of knowledge. If the business impact cannot be identified today, it likely
    makes sense to store and transform the data so that it can be used later on. Processing
    data is a vital component of a data strategy as it turns raw data into a finished
    good. As such, it turns data generated from business applications into an asset
    that can be used for data-driven decision making.

    from many sources, this would be an immense waste of time and energy! As importantly,
    an organization would waste precious human resources if it would expect its developers
    to spend enormous amounts of time building logic to match and link entities across
    many data sources on an ad-hoc basis.

    will meet this harsh realization and their performance will begin to plateau.
    Of course, you can mask this behavior by bolstering your technology talent, but
    it does not erase the problem.

    and transforming analytics data from many disparate systems enables the organization
    to make proper use of data and maintain its agility. In fact, this part of the
    data strategy might be most critical as it enables end-users to make quicker use
    of data.

    and simpler operations but it does not scale well. Depending on where you are

    a data strategy is an evolving process. Understanding the need for a data strategy
    and a committee to oversee its implementation is a good start. Members of the
    organization start to think about data as a strategic asset that enables better
    understanding of their business, and how they can use it to drive value.

- en: The process of identifying all data entities, data sources, definitions, and
    relationships should be the first point of entry. The next step is defining the
    governance standards to use data, and a system to link all data sources together.
    Each process in the data strategy should have key stakeholders to drive that part
    of the process. For example, a member from the data reporting and operations team
    is most likely suited to drive the data governance standards. Taking advantage
    of the expertise of your data committee ensures that you are able to deliver and
    implement a data strategy quickly and effectively.
