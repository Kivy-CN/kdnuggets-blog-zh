    as ChatGPT and also layoffs, there are a lot of questions and opinions around
    whether the tech industry is still worth entering. There has also been a great
    emphasis that software development is dead - but they are wrong.

    use of AI and machine learning tools are taking over? Just the same way any other
    role in the world will have to evolve to improve their workflow and efficiency
    with the current market, software developers will do the same with the new tools
    that are getting released.

    and troubleshooting. Nothing is ever the finished product. Therefore, tools like
    ChatGPT, which are providing a better workflow and work-life balance for a lot
    of people still require experts with the right skills to ensure it runs smoothly.

    due to layoffs. However, the number of layoffs remains largely unchanged, regardless
    of what you are seeing on the internet.

    haven’t started. Digital solutions are the main business goal, therefore the demand
    for skilled software developers shows little to no sign of slowing down.

- en: According to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/), they
    predict a growth rate of 26% for software developer positions over the next decade.
    This means we will be seeing an increase of 1.2 million new software developer
    jobs by 2030.

    over the years, but at its core, it will require software developers who have
    the ability to solve problems and provide businesses with opportunities to build
    better solutions.
