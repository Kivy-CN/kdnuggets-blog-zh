    End to end management , Complex systems, lifecycle management, formal Requirements
    engineering, reliability, logistics etc. Systems Engineering also takes a **‘System
    of Systems’ approach**. Systems engineering problems are solved **using the following
    steps**: (as per INCOSE):  State the problem, Investigate Alternatives, Model
    the system, Integrate, Launch the system, Assess performance, Re-evaluate. They
    often also involve working with **systems patterns as part of the basic ideas

    complex, the nature of the problem requires a more holistic approach/systems thinking
    approach.  This applies especially to areas like Deep Learning

    have to spend many cycles on integrating components for experimenting neural networks,
    managing intermediate training states, organizing training-related data, and enabling
    hyper- parameter tuning in responses to varied events. This makes deployment of
    integrated applications like DRLs, GANs, model cross-validation and hyper parameter
    optimization easier.
