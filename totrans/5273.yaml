- en: HTAP is a term coined by [The Gartner Group](https://www.gartner.com/doc/2657815/hybrid-transactionanalytical-processing-foster-opportunities)
    to describe a class of database systems that are Hybrid Transactional and Analytical
    Processing Systems. These systems exhibit the transactional capabilities of operational
    databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, MySQL, and Postgres as well as the
    capabilities of analytical systems such as Teradata, Netezza, and Vertica.

- en: The power of HTAP is to serve a new class of applications that are intelligent
    –  applications that analyze real-time data to provide the most timely insights
    possible. Previous generations of databases could not service such applications
    because the data had to move from operational systems to analytical systems via
    an ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Load) process that typically takes many
    hours. It could even take s days before an analytical system would be able to
    process the data. This inherent lag caused by ETL required companies, governments,
    and academic researchers to look through the rear-view mirror of their operation
    instead of looking forward through the windshield.

- en: HTAP enables new technical capabilities such as machine learning, real-time
    operational reporting and dashboarding, and reactive systems. These capabilities
    serve as the foundation for a new class of intelligent applications. These applications
    are always-on, reacting to data streaming in, and adaptively improving as they
    see more data. When applications are always-on it means that they run continuously,
    unlike traditional data science where you first prepare data and analyze, and
    then report. By reacting, we mean that the application monitors its inputs, which
    may stream in or be batch ingested, and when certain data patterns emerge, the
    application takes action. For example, healthcare applications that can surveil
    Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and alert clinicians of dangerous conditions
    for patients in hospitals are good examples of always-on, reactive systems. Supply-chain
    systems, fraud detection, cybersecurity, and marketing applications have similar
    properties. With the more improved foundation that HTAP provides, these applications
    can now improve automatically over time with more data. By integrating machine
    learning models with HTAP, applications can become adaptive.

- en: SAP HANA primarily focuses on OLAP, which is used for analytical workloads.
    It is ACID compliant and handles transactional updates, but these are not optimized
    for large-scale real-time OLTP workloads and is not typically used to power real-time,
    concurrent applications. HANA is primarily an in-memory system requiring the entire
    data set to be in memory. This system uses a hybrid representation where data
    is inserted in tuples (row-based) and then converted to columnar. You can bypass
    tuple-based insertion as well and go directly columnar. HANA is strictly a scale-up
    engineered solution with excellent performance but at a very high cost. This system
    is not open source but is available as a service through SAP.
