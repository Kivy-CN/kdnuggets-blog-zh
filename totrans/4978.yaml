    acquired Milan-based i4C Analytics, a small Milan-based company. Accenture [rebranded](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220095702/http://www.accenture.com/us-en/Pages/service-analytics-applications-platform.aspx)
    the software as the Accenture Analytics Applications Platform. However, it appears
    that Accenture gives away the software in bundled consulting deals since it [reports](http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC.Enhanced/SecCapsule.aspx?c=129731&fid=10461015)
    no revenue from software licensing.

    is a mystery.

    despite being so marginal that they lack a record in [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/#/home/index).
     Last year, Gartner noted that “Megaputer scores low on viability and visibility
    and there is a lack of awareness of the company outside of text analytics in the
    advanced analytics market.” Which begs the question: why were they included in
    the first place?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: — **Prognoz** appeared in the MQ for two years running and, like Megaputer,
    inspired WTF reactions from folks in the know.  Primarily a BI tool with some
    time-series and analytics functionality included, Prognoz lacks the predictive
    analytics capabilities that Gartner says are minimally required. It also appears
    to lack customers West of Moscow.

    can no longer dismiss it as “that French company.” The company markets Data Science
    Studio, a drag-and-drop interface that runs on top of open source platforms and
    has a slew of database connectors.

    features. Originally marketed as a cloud-based managed service, Domino now offers
    its platform for on-premises implementation.

    H2O.ai operates on a pure open source model, which makes it unique among the vendors
    included in this year’s MQ.

    it’s the #3 vendor in the advanced and predictive analytics segment, with 10%
    of the market, and it has held that position for years. Thus, its exclusion from
    the previous MQs is a mystery. Exactly how do you miss a vendor with a quarter-billion

    ties to Greenplum and EMC were once a feature, now a bug.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to its small size, Alpine is struggling to gain significant market visibility,
    which accounts for the drop in its Ability to Execute score. Of the vendors surveyed,
    it submitted the fewest reference customers, and 20% of those expressed concern
    about the small size of the community of users with whom they could network and
    share knowledge.

    its 60 customers in 2015, I suspect that the comparison is not favorable.

    due to limited visualization tools and some scalability issues. These product
    attributes don’t change from year to year; the implication is that Gartner put
    more weight on them in this year’s MQ.

    have moved to include data in the open-source Hadoop ecosystem, which is now considered
    first-class. As such, it is equal in status to the proprietary stores that are
    predominantly used for traditional data warehouses.

    of a data science platform, you can’t claim that it is the only attribute that
