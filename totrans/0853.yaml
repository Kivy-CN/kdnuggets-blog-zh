    - you will have had a read or know the skills required. You will need a programming
    language, an understanding of mathematical statistics, the ability to create data
    visualizations, and more.

    into visualizations - you will need to be able to explain these. As a data professional,
    it can be difficult for non-technical people to understand technical language.

    to non-technical people. Not only will you come across non-technical people, but
    you may be dealing with someone who prefers explanations through visualizations,
    or project run-throughs.

    will not come from a technical background. Therefore, some of the terminology
    used in your everyday team will be foreign to them. For example, F1 score or cross-validation.
  prefs: []

- en: Think about how a teacher explains a topic to a student, and keep that at the
    front of your mind when you’re explaining to your audience. Translate your data
    science terminology in a language that everybody can understand. If there is no
    way you can replace a specific data science term, there is no harm in explaining
    what it means. You will do more harm by losing your audience's attention to technical
    words.

    your findings, don’t limit yourself and put yourself in a rut where you have to
    answer 1000 questions. Visualizations can answer questions for you.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your choice on which structure you choose is dependent on how well you know
    your audience. You can always trial and error both structures to see which one
    is most effective. A good way to measure how effective the structure is for your
    audience is by noting which structure had less questions. The less questions your
    audience has, the more successful your storytelling was.
