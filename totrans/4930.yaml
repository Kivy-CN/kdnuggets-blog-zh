    recent analysis of KDnuggets Poll results ([**Python overtakes R, becomes the
    leader in Data Science, Machine Learning platforms**](/2017/08/python-overtakes-r-leader-analytics-data-science.html))
    has gathered a lot of attention and generated a tremendous number of comments,
    discussion, and inevitable critique from proponents of both languages.'

    self-selected sample. That is obviously true. But KDnuggets has conducted polls
    since 2001 and reaches a large audience of several hundred thousand visitors each
    month. In our experience KDnuggets polls have been a good indicator of trends
    and developments in Data Mining and Data Science. We tracked R vs Python debate
    for several years, so unlike other sites we can compare the latest poll results
    with several previous years.

    1 language of 2017](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages)
    (thanks to Martin Skarzynski [**@marskar**](https://twitter.com/marskar) for the
    link), so it is unfair to compare Python and R searches directly, but we can compare
    Google Trends for search terms "Python data science" vs "R data science".

    popularity, but "Python data science" searches moved ahead of "R data science"
    in late 2016 and are clearly ahead since January 2017.
