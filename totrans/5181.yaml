- en: Many organisations have data stored in databases, and SQL is a querying language
    commonly used to extract the data from these databases. In fact, many large organisations
    such as Facebook and Amazon have included SQL as a component of their technical
    skill tests. This is because being able to put together the relevant data is important
    before performing any necessary data analysis.

- en: One challenge to practising SQL is that we need databases to begin with, which
    is something we often do not have. However, [data.world](https://data.world/)
    allows us to do exactly that without having our own database. We can perform SQL
    queries on publicly available datasets on data.world directly. It is free to create
    an account on data.world, and you do not need to incur any costs performing SQL
    queries!

    on Singapore’s Covid-19 trends. The query feature is sometimes hidden under the
    dropdown of the three dots button, or it might appear at the top right corner
    of the dataset represented with *a >_* symbol.

    cases, with the output ordered by descending date order. A link to the query can
    be found [here](https://data.world/hxchua/covid-19-singapore/workspace/query?queryid=ccf5e890-f95c-4200-ab43-898f1bc6ebb5).

- en: On the other hand, the SQL below computes the percentage increase day-on-day
    in the cumulative number of individuals who’ve completed their vaccination, with
    the output ordered by descending date order. This requires a self-join, i.e.,
    joining a table with itself. I’ve made use of the DATE_SUB function as part of
    the self-join to get the data from the previous day against the current day. Clicking
    on the text DATE_SUB also returns more information about the function and the
    parameters necessary. A link to the query can be found [here](https://data.world/hxchua/covid-19-singapore/workspace/query?queryid=3d605e2f-9f24-4fdd-b5a4-c519ce46e224).

    on data.world that covers basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL concepts. Hence
    it is a good open-source platform to learn and practise SQL.

    to how SQL tests can be conducted, this might also be a good platform to consider.
