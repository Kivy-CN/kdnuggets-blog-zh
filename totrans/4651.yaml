    20th annual KDnuggets Software Poll had over 1,800 participants. The average voter
    chose 6.1 different tools, so voters with just one choice stood out. We removed
    about 180 such "lone" votes (2/3 were from one vendor), because even if they represented
    legitimate users of that tool, their experience was not representative of what
    Data Scientists do in 2019.'

    were removed. More detailed association analysis and anonymized data will be published
