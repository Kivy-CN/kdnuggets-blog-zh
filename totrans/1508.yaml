  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The knowledge graph consists in integrated collections of data and information
    that also contains huge numbers of links between different data. The key here
    is that instead of looking for possible answers, under this new model **we’re
    seeking an answer.** We want the facts — where those facts come from is less important.
    The data here can represent concepts, objects, things, people and actually whatever
    you have in mind. The graph fills in the relationships, the connections between
    the concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowledge graphs also allow you to create structures for the relationships in
    the graph. With it, it’s possible to set up a framework to study data and its
    relation to other data ([remember ontology?](https://towardsdatascience.com/ontology-and-data-science-45e916288cc5)).

    that mass can deform space-time, and that deformation is what we understand as
    gravity. I know that if you are not familiar with the theory it can sound weird.
    Let me try to explain it.

    laws of mechanics take on an especially simple form: As long as no external force
    is acting on an object, it will move on a straight line through space-time: at
    a constant velocity along a straight path (Newton’s first law of mechanics).'

    the answer with Anzo too. The Anzo for Machine Learning solution replaces this

    properly utilize.
  prefs: []

    so we need an easy way to reuse harmonized structured and unstructured data by
    managing catalogs of data sets as well as ongoing aspects of data integrations
    such as data quality processing, and this is what the data fabric provides. It
    also retains end-to-end lineage and provenance for the data comprising machine
    learning datasets so that it is easy to find out what data transformations are
    required when it comes to using models in production.

    it’s the future of the field (how optimistic of me). Inside of the data fabric,
    we have new concepts like ontology, semantics, layers, knowledge-graph, etc; but
    all of those can improve the way we think about and do machine learning.
