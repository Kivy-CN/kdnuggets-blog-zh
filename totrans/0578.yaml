- en: Data analytics is relatively new, but it has dozens of use cases. Companies
    have collected information for generations. More recently, though, tech tools
    let them evaluate that info and make informed decisions based on what it indicates.
    Since data science is an emerging field, some business leaders hesitate to adopt
    it or want to do so at a frustratingly slow pace.

    analytics investments are smart for your company to pursue.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing to do is resist the urge to pepper your pitch with highbrow
    language. Many of the big data definitions you can likely give in your sleep are
    probably akin to a foreign language to your boss. While figuring out what to say,
    keep your words and tone down to earth as much as possible.

- en: You may even want to deliver your message to a friend who’s completely unfamiliar
    with data analytics before approaching your boss. Ask them if they understood
    what you said and if they felt confused at any point. Also, get their input on
    what you could do to make the presentation even more appropriate for people without
    extensive data analytics knowledge.

    an inability to compete often results in companies shutting down or encountering
    intense struggles in the marketplace.

- en: It’s worth bringing up to your boss, then, that many business leaders recognize
    the link between big data investment and increased competitiveness. NewVantage
    Partners published its [2019 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://newvantage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Big-Data-Executive-Survey-2019-Findings-Updated-010219-1.pdf)
    to get a picture of the investment patterns related to those two technologies.
    It showed that more than 91% of the respondents accelerated the pace of their
    big data and artificial intelligence (AI) investments.

    investments as necessary to transform into agile and competitive businesses. Representatives
    from Ford Motors, Capital One and Aetna were among the brands giving feedback.
    The fact that such well-known names saw the link between competition and big data
    investment may encourage your boss to follow suit.

    command to get things approved like lower-level employees typically must.'

    things — and increase the odds of your boss deciding in your favor — by taking
    a cue from salespeople. Spend time to understand the motivations that drive the
    person of authority. In other words, think of what they'd most likely want to
    achieve after giving the go-ahead to a big data investment.

    in-depth look to get at the heart of your boss's concerns. For example, what problems
    might compromise profitability that big data could solve?

    its data and used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help. The company knew that downtime
    with some of its machinery could cost the company millions of dollars per year.
    It used data analytics to help predict some equipment failures [up to three months
    in advance](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/georgia-pacific/). Spend
    time thinking about existing pain points in your company that big data could address.
    Then, reserve some time during your pitch to highlight why analytics could provide
    such promising possibilities.

- en: Your boss may fear that increasing the company's investment could enable data
    scientists to extract more insights while leaving others in the dark. However,
    some companies use analytics in ways that break down the barriers that information
    might otherwise pose.

    TD Bank wanted to make it easier for analysts to utilize the company's information
    without requiring too much help from data scientists. It ultimately made data
    sets more available for everyone who needed them to use. TD Bank also devoted
    time to assessing which tools would help it achieve that goal.

    accessible to data experts, be proactive to ease that worry. You could suggest
    that your boss create a list of the must-have features of a data analysis tool,
    then offer to spend time researching which software has those offerings.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to bringing up companies that are using data analytics and getting
    satisfying results, try to include statistics in the pitch to your boss. It's
    ideal if you can find information related to things like money saved, improved
    productivity or better customer interactions.

- en: It's more impactful if you can mention that a company from your industry saw
    a 72% cost savings benefit one year after allocating more of its budget to data
    science instead of saying it saw a substantial increase. Be as specific as possible
    as you describe the benefits your boss is likely to see after incorporating data
    science.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the primary advantages of data analytics software is that it can extract
    results from huge amounts of information in much less time than humans can. You
    can keep that in mind while discussing how failing to bring data science into
    the business could mean the company is not adequately informed.

- en: For example, data analytics could show that millennials aren't responding well
    to a particular marketing campaign, but people from 40-50 like it the most. It
    may indicate that a certain city is an excellent location for a new branch based
    on the number of calls from customers who want it there.
  prefs: []

- en: Angle your pitch to make it clear that data analytics investments are increasingly
    necessary in this day in age. They keep people more informed than they'd likely
    be without such technology.

    serious conversation with your boss to convince them to give the nod of approval
    to data analytics. It'll also help if you're confident in what you say.
  prefs: []

    need to know and get back to them. Taking that approach shows you're careful yet
    persistent.
