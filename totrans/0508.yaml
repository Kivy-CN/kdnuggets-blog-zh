    the (supposed) dream jobs at one of the big tech companies. The positive news
    is that you have it in your hand to gain a competitive advantage for such a position
    by preparing yourself adequately.

    videos and data science academies. As a beginner, you feel lost. Which course
    should I attend? What topics should I learn? On what methods do I need to focus?
    What tool and programming language must I study?

    and choose one, complete that course and then select another one.

    choosing another one. No one can tell you that. Period.

    one data science course does not exclude that you are taking another one.

    of experience. In every still so “simply” beginner course, I detect a new aspect
    and a new view on the topic. And this is exactly what finally makes a high-demanded
    data scientist. It’s to understand all the different perspectives on a topic.

    mentioned in the CV help to get a job faster. But the contrary is true. When applying
    for a job and you started only six months ago with data science for every recruiter,
    it’s clear that it is buzzword dropping with no substance behind it.

    There are more than 50 regression types, and each comes with different preconditions.
    So, only have “regression” in your CV does not say anything. Also, regression
    models are still the most important models for applications and to set the basis
    of understanding for data science in general.
  prefs: []

    do the parameters mean; what are pitfalls; and so on, and so forth.

    recruiter — or today, the algorithms behind the process — can identify the depth
    of your understanding.

    as many algorithms as possible. Also, here you should focus on understanding a
    few and not on quantity.

    of code. And this can only be learned by reviewing other code.

    those that cannot, but the ones that understand its architecture and those that
    do not.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you should not do certifications. But they can serve as a motivation, and finally,
    they show officially your progress and your eagerness to learn. I still do certificates.
    There is nothing wrong with it, and when you invest time, it is legitimate to
    have it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of people that have the same certifications. So, to have a competitive advantage,
    you must go beyond that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, a student of mine approached me for support for an internship opportunity
    in the finance field. He wanted to apply what he has learned and get to know the
    culture and cooperation within a data science team. I could place him with a bank,
    and he writes a semester thesis from that. Yes, it is stressful to do the study
    and the internship and semester thesis in parallel. But it will give him an invaluable
    competitive advantage for job offers.

    And the more arguments they hear, the more confused they are. Even though confusion
    is required to the path of clarity, it should not remain a steady state.
  prefs: []

    path and opinion. I am used to saying, “if you have two data scientist in a room,
    you have at least four different opinions.”

    but not as the information itself.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but I can tell you that’s wrong from more than 20 years of experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Too often, I saw data scientists presenting findings to the business people,
    and the reaction was, “oh, we know this already. What we need is ‘why that happens’
    and ‘how to solve it.’ Or, in the worst case, ‘this is absolute nonsense because
    this is not how our business works.’ Boom!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is more important to have domain knowledge than knowing all the sexist and
    fanciest methods. A data scientist is solving a business problem, not a technical
    problem. By solving a business problem, you bring value to the company’s business,
    and you have only so much value as the value of your solution. You do this successfully
    when you know the business.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very easy to be distracted or give up early because you do not understand
    the topic. Learning data science is a marathon and not a sprint. So, it is essential
    to build up a routine to study ongoing and consistent. Like in marathon training,
    you train in small units but daily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not mean that you have mastered it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me give you an example. In the mathematical finance lectures, I had to learn
    many limit theorems. The exam went excellent, and I was convinced that I understand
    them. But seven years later, when I had to review code for the valuation of complex
    structure financial products, the scales fell from my eyes, and I realized that
    I did not understand it until that moment of code review.
  prefs: []

    whether you are an aspiring or already a senior data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The learning should consist of new data science topics, already learned topics
    but from another perspective, e.g. another course or book, new technologies and
    technology trends, industry and business knowledge, data visualization and data
    storytelling, and applications to data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a data science job, you will primarily communicate your findings to non-technical
    people, notably, the people from the business. And the business is financing your
    job. Without their commitment, your job and the data science team would not exist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    only for the sake of application.

- en: A friend of mine is the data science lead of a global bank. When they are hiring
    data scientists, they send them two weeks in advance a dataset and ask for a 20
    minutes presentation. No further input is given. They want to see the storytelling.
    They are not interested in the methods applied — except a candidate would tell
    absolute nonsense about the methods used. What they want to see is, first, the
    framing of the business problem and why it is important to solve. Second, what
    should be solved and last, how it is solved, and the result in a business context.
    “This is the most important work we do the whole day. A candidate must not be
    perfect in that but show that she/he has understood what is important in our job.”

    visualization of data in a business context.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the other data scientists are seen as competitors, and one is reluctant to exchange
    knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But living in your world where you only read and learn based on your selection
    is highly biased, and many perspectives on a topic or method are missing. Further,
    the open discourse about a topic and gaining experience in argumentation is missing
    — a skill needed by any data scientist.
  prefs: []
