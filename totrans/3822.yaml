  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's next to impossible to understand your data without data visualization.
    Data visualization takes the data you've gathered and analyzed and turns it into
    easily digestible visual content such as images and graphs. These visuals allow
    data scientists and analysts to make sense of otherwise undetectable trends in
    their data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data visualization is essential if you intend to analyze large sets of data,
    and R's ggplot2 package is one of the best data visualization tools available
    for use. The package allows users to map out nearly any plot of data they desire,
    and becoming proficient in ggplot2 is a great first step to take if you intend
    to harness R's full potential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also consider combining the syntax that the ggplot2 package offers with
    tools such as Plotly or Shiny. These will allow you to customize your data visualizations
    and dashboards and make them more interactive. If you have a front-end developer
    with whom you work, you can [leverage their skills](https://www.waveapps.com/freelancing/what-is-front-end-developer)
    to make your visuals more impressive and easier to read. In the meantime, it may
    also be a good idea to explore courses that explore data visualization with ggplot2,
    Plotly, and Shiny.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most projects in data science require that exploratory data analysis be conducted
    before anything else occurs. Exploratory data analysis covers the same steps you'd
    follow to characterize a dataset. Determining different types of data, locating
    pieces of information that are missing, and identifying distributions of values
    and correlations between data points all typically fall under exploratory data
    analysis.

    of via [exploratory data analysis](/2021/02/powerful-exploratory-data-analysis-sweetviz.html)
    is mandatory once you obtain new data. R offers a suite of packages known as "tidyverse,"
    which includes tidyr and dplyr, that allow users to explore, manipulate, and calculate
    on their datasets. The tidyverse suite of packages has a syntax that's simple
    to use and makes it easy for users to obtain the answers they're looking for quickly.

    R's tidyverse suite of packages, it's a good idea to explore courses that dive

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're aiming to learn and master the R programming language, you'll need
    a way to make sure that your data analysis is scientifically rigorous. Statistics
    are just the thing you need to ensure that scientific rigor is [present in your
    data analysis](/2022/06/statistics-probability-data-science.html), and R is the
    language you can use to leverage multiple statistical tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Out of all the programming languages available for use, R has arguably the largest
    number of tools that focus specifically on statistics. R's suite of tools allows
    you to perform various statistical functions. Whether you need to arrive at descriptive
    statistics such as standard deviations and means, create models that map logistic
    and linear regression, or experiment with A/B testing, R's statistical capabilities
    are far-reaching indeed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interested in capitalizing on the power of statistics that R can give you? It's
    recommended that you explore some courses that introduce you to statistics, linear
    and logistic regression, and A/B testing in R.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning is undoubtedly one of the most widely discussed topics among
    the data science community, and it's easy to see why. Machine learning [allows
    data scientists](https://hevodata.com/learn/machine-learning-in-data-science-2/)
    and analysts to automate how they arrive at crucial insights, recognize data patterns,
    and develop highly accurate predictive models. And the best part? You don't need
    to use explicitly defined programming instructions to take advantage of the power
    of machine learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within the context of using the R programming language, machine learning allows
    data scientists and analysts to make accurate and wide-reaching predictions. At
    its core, machine learning encapsulates the art of arriving at predictions with
    the power of data. And as with statistics, R offers its users a huge array of
    tools that allow them to run multiple machine learning models of their choosing.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The R Markdown package is highly popular among working professionals who frequently
    generate automated presentations and reports. Why is this the case? It's mainly
    because R Markdown can run code written in R while a document is being rendered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An extension of Markdown, [R Markdown is a markup language](https://blog.nebu.com/using-r-markdown-to-auto-generate-multiple-document-types)
    that's lightweight and easy to use. Whereas Markdown allows users to add things
    such as headers and lists to their documents, R Markdown goes a step further by
    handling the R programming language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're wondering why this is important, keep in mind that once you've conducted
    your data analysis, you'll want to be able to report on your findings. R Markdown
    is exactly the package you need to structure your findings in comprehensible reports.
    It gives users an easy-to-use syntax that lets them create reports in multiple
    formats, be they written documents, presentations, or books.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also worth noting is that with the help of R Markdown, users can fill their
    documents with information relevant to the complex calculations they make. You
    could, for instance, include in your R Markdown-generated reports the results
    of a questionnaire you conducted that take into account the responses of many
    respondents. With the help of R Markdown, you can generate a document that includes
    real data and is also clean and visually appealing.
