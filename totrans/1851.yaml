    those connected "things" (collectively called - The Internet of Things) generate
    more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily. That's enough to fill 57.5 billion
    32 GB iPads per day (source Gartner). All this data is bound to significantly
    impact many business processes over the next few years. Thus, the concept of IoT
    Analytics (Data Science for IoT) is expected to drive the business models for
    IoT. According to [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/09/21/strong-analytics-skills-3x-more-likely-to-lead-to-success-with-internet-of-things-iot/#ec0c512b01e9),
    strong analytics skills are likely to lead to 3x more success with Internet of
    Things. We cover many of these ideas in the [Data Science for IoT course](http://www.opengardensblog.futuretext.com/archives/2016/06/data-science-for-internet-of-things-course-aug-sep-2016-now-in-its-fourth-batch.html).

    with a range of devices and also a variety of radio technologies. It is a rapidly
    shifting ecosystem with new technologies like [LoRa, LTE-M, Sigfox](http://www.nickhunn.com/lora-vs-lte-m-vs-sigfox/)
    etc. The deployment of 5G will make a big difference because we would have both
    Local area and Wide area connectivity. Each of the verticals (we track Smart homes,
    Retail, Healthcare, Smart cities, Energy, Transportation, Manufacturing and Wearables)
    also have a specific set of IoT devices and radio technologies. For example, for
    wearables you see Bluetooth 4.0 in use but for Industrial IoT, you are likely
    to see cellular technologies which guarantee Quality of Service such as the [GE
    Predix alliance with Verizon](http://rethink-iot.com/2014/10/17/ge-opens-1bn-predix-iot-platform-adds-verizon-m2m-connectivity/)

    verticals. In traditional Data Science, we use a variety of algorithms ([Top Algorithms

    For IoT, time series models are often used. This means : ARIMA, Holt Winters,
    moving average. The difference is the volume of data but also more sophisticated
    real time implementations of the same models ex (pdf) : [ARIIMA: Real IoT implementation
    of a machine learning architecture for reducing energy consumption](http://morelab.deusto.es/media/publications/2014/booksection/ariima-a-real-iot-implementation-of-a-machine-learning-architecture-for-reducing-energy-consumption.pdf).
    The use of models vary across IoT verticals. For example in Manufacturing : predictive
    maintenance, anomaly detection, forecasting and missing event interpolation are
    common. In Telecoms, traditional models like churn modelling, cross sell, upsell
    model , customer life time value could include IoT as an input.'

    overnight by observation and through reinforcement learning. Fanuc's robot uses
    reinforcement learning to train itself. After eight hours or so it gets to 90
    percent accuracy or above, which is almost the same as if an expert were to program
    it. The process can be accelerated if several robots work in parallel and then
    share what they have learned. This form of distributed learning is called [cloud

    within the Enterprise. Enterprises are getting an 'AI layer'. Any entity in an
    enterprise can train other 'peer' entities in the Enterprise. That could be buildings
    learning from other buildings - or planes or oil rigs or even Printers! Training
    could be dynamic and on-going (for example one building learns about energy consumption
    and 'teaches' the next building). IoT is a key source of Data for the Enterprise
    IoT system. Currently, the best example of this approach is Salesforce.com and
    Einstein. Reinforcement learning is the key technology that drives IoT and AI
    layer for the Enterprise.
