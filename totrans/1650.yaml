    the history of their discipline. He makes many generalizations regarding what
    “all or most statisticians” would do in a given situation, and then shows us that
    this would be wrong. He offers no evidence in support of these generalizations,
    many of which strike me as what a competent statistician would *not*do. Likewise,
    some of what he claims is new or even radical thinking may cause some statisticians
    to scratch their heads since it’s what they've done for years, though perhaps

    generating process, and are uninterested in theory and causal analysis is particularly
    amusing in light of the at times acrimonious discussions between statisticians
    and data scientists from other backgrounds. He also disregards the myriad complex
    experimental designs and analyses of data obtained through these designs via ANOVA
    and MANOVA – which also can become quite complex – that explicitly consider a
    causal framework. These designs as well as ANOVA and MANOVA have been in use for
    many decades. Related to this, historically, statisticians have specialized in
    particular disciplines, such as agriculture, economics, pharmacology and psychology,
    because subject matter expertise is necessary for them to be effective - statistics
    is not just mathematics.

    been ignored by researchers in many fields, and that this frequently is the reason
    for dubious practices in these disciplines, not deficiencies of statistics itself.
    For example, statisticians have frequently advised researchers against drawing
    causal implications based on *correlations alone* in the absence of sound theory
    and a causal model based on this theory, often to no avail. Note that this is
    very different from claiming correlation is irrelevant or that it means *no* causation
    is present. It differs starkly from believing causation is immaterial and should
    not be explored. Statisticians also contribute to the design of research and lengthy
    discussions about causation are not unusual. Most researchers are interested in
    the why and statisticians who aren’t are an endangered species.

    software may fit the data about equally well but suggest very different courses
    of action for decision-makers. This can turn into a tightrope walk. More commonly,
    they may be given a set of cross tabulations and asked for their interpretation.
    It could be that something in the data does not make sense to the researcher or

    path analysis, had received the attention they merited.

    is worth, I would urge statisticians and researchers to read him. In **The Book
    of Why**, especially,he provides many vivid examples of how to do research wrong
    and how to do it better. Apart from his strange opinions about statistics and
    statisticians, my main criticism of Pearl is that he overstates his case. For
    example, in my experience path diagrams and DAG are aids to causal analysis, but
    not essential. Some people find them confusing. He also appears little interested
    in sampling and data quality, or with the possibility that dissimilar causal models
    may operate for latent classes.

    is really a reminder that theories are often constructed (or taken apart) in small
    bits and pieces over many years through the hard work of many independent researchers.
    Frequently, these small bits and pieces can only be tested through experimentation
    since the requisite observational data does not exist.

    are the regular guys of research and the unsung heroes of causal analysis.
