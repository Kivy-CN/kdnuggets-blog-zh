- en: One of the best ways to measure the popularity or market share of software for
    data science is to count the number of job advertisements that highlight knowledge
    of each as a requirement. Job ads are rich in information and are backed by money,
    so they are perhaps the best measure of how popular each software is now. Plots
    of change in job demand give us a good idea of what is likely to become more popular
    in the future.

- en: Indeed.com is the biggest job site in the U.S., making its collection of job
    ads the best around. As their co-founder and former CEO Paul Forster stated, Indeed.com
    includes “all the jobs from over 1,000 unique sources, comprising the major job
    boards – Monster, CareerBuilder, HotJobs, Craigslist – as well as hundreds of
    newspapers, associations, and company websites." Indeed.com also has superb search
    capabilities. It used to have a job trend plotter, but that tool has apparently
    been shut down.

- en: Searching for jobs using Indeed.com is easy, but searching for software in a
    way that ensures fair comparisons across packages is challenging. Some software
    is used only for data science (e.g., SPSS, Apache Spark) while others are used
    in data science jobs and more broadly in report-writing jobs (e.g., SAS, Tableau).
    General-purpose languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) are heavily used in data science
    jobs, but the vast majority of jobs that use them have nothing to do with data
    science. To level the playing field, I developed a protocol to focus the search
    for each software within only jobs for data scientists. The details of this protocol
    are described in a separate article, *[How to Search for Data Science Jobs](http://r4stats.com/articles/how-to-search-for-data-science-jobs/)*.
    All the graphs in this section use those procedures to make the required queries.

    24, 2017\. One might think that a sample from a single day might not be very stable,
    but the large number of job sources makes the counts in Indeed.com’s collection
    of jobs quite consistent. Data collected in 2017 and 2014 using the same protocol
    correlated r=.94, p=.002.

    with  25,877\. Java and Amazon’s Machine Learning (ML) tools are roughly 25% further
    below, with jobs in the 17,000s. R and the C variants come next with around 13,000\.
    People frequently compare R and Python, but when it comes to getting a data science
    job, there are only half as many for R as for Python. That doesn’t mean they’re
    the same sort of job, of course. I still see more statisticians using R and machine
    learning people preferring Python, but Python is definitely on a roll! From Hadoop
    on down, there is a slow decline in jobs. R is also frequently compared to SAS,
    which has only 8,123 compared to R’s 13,800.

    1b. Mathematica and Julia are the leaders of this set, with around 219 jobs each.
    The ancient FORTRAN language is still hanging on to life with 195 jobs. The open
    source WEKA software and IBM’s Watson are next, with around 185 each. From XGBOOST
    on down, there is a fairly steady slow decline.

    RapidMiner, and SPSS Modeler. They’re all around the same area between 50 and
    100 jobs. In many of the other measures of popularity, RapidMiner beats the very
    similar KNIME tool, but here there are 50% more jobs for the latter. Alteryx is
    also a workflow-based tool, however, it has pulled away from the pack, appearing
    back on Figure 1a with 901 jobs.'

    From Systat on down, none of the packages have more than 10 job listings.

- en: It’s important to note that the values shown in Figures 1a and 1b are single
    points in time. The number of jobs for the more popular software do not change
    much from day-to-day. Therefore, the relative rankings of the software shown in
    Figure 1a is unlikely to change much over the coming year or two. The less popular
    packages shown in Figure 1b have such low job counts that their ranking is more
    likely to shift from month-to-month, though their position relative to the major
    packages should remain more stable.

    1c shows the percent change for those packages that had at least 100 job listings
    back in 2017\. Without such a limitation, software that goes from 1 job in 2017
    to 5 jobs in 2019 would have a 500% increase, but still would be of little interest.
    Software whose job market is heating up, or growing, is shown in red, while those
    that are cooling down are shown in blue.

    523%. Next is Apache Flink, a tool that analyzes streaming data, at 289%. H2O
