    information expressed numerically, such as frequencies, percentages and average.
    Just looking at the TV news and newspaper, you have seen the inflation data in
    the world, the number of employed and unemployed people in your country, the data
    about mortal incidents in the street and the percentages of votes for each political
    party from a survey. All these examples are statistics.

    called Statistics. Statistics is a science concerned with developing and studying
    methods for collecting, interpreting and presenting empirical data. Moreover,
    you can divide the field of Statistics into two different sectors: Descriptive
    Statistics and Inferential Statistics.'

    work well on that particular sample, but it doesn’t mean that it’s going to have
    good performances on a new sample. Everything depends on our training sample,
    that needs to be representative, to generalise well the characteristics of the
    population.

    like the occupation status (employed, unemployed and people searching for a job)
    and the type of the job. As the numerical variables, the categorical variables
    can be split into two different types: ordinal and nominal. A variable is ordinal
    when there is a natural ordering of the categories. An example can be the salary
    with low, medium and high levels. When the categorical variable doesn’t follow
    any order, it’s nominal. A simple example of a nominal variable is the gender
    with levels Female and Male.'

    Now, it’s time to study the relationships between the variables. For this purpose,
    it’s common to calculate **Pearson correlation**, which is a measure of the linear
    relationship between two variables. The range of this correlation coefficient
    is within -1 and 1\. The more the value of the correlation is near to one of these
    two extremes, the more the relationship is strong. If it’s near to 0, there is
    a weak relationship between the two variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    between two variables. In this graphical representation, each point corresponds
    to a specific observation. It’s often not very informative when there is a lot
    of variability within the data. To capture more information from the pair of variables
    is by adding smoothed lines and transforming the data.

    distribution in statistics. It’s characterised by a bell curve for its particular
    shape, tall in the middle and tails towards the end. It’s symmetric and unimodal
    with a peak. Moreover, there are two parameters that have a crucial role in normal
    distribution: the mean and the standard deviation. The mean coincides with the
    peak, while the width of the curve is represented by the standard deviation. There
    is a particular type of Normal distribution, called **Standard Normal Distribution**,
    with mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 1\. It’s obtained by subtracting the
    mean from the original value and, then, dividing by the standard deviation.'

    normal distribution, it’s unimodal and symmetric around zero. It slightly differs
    from the gaussian distribution because it has less mass in the middle and there
    are more masses in the tails. It’s considered when we have a small sample size.
    The more the sample size increases, the more the t-distribution will converge
    to a normal distribution.

    evaluate an hypothesis about the population based on sample data. So, it is a
    form of inferential statistics. This process starts with a hypothesis of the population
    parameters, also called null hypothesis, that needs to be tested, while the alternative
    hypothesis (H1) represents the opposite statement. If the data is very different
    from the assumptions we had, then the null hypothesis (H0) is rejected and the
    outcome is said to be “statistically significant”.

    Before applying the statistical model, we prefer to check the normality of a feature
    that regards the weight of adult women with diabete. The **Shapiro-Wilk test**
    can come to our rescue. There is also a Python library, called Scipy, with the
    implementation of this [test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.shapiro.html),
    in which the null hypothesis is that the variable follows a normal distribution. 
    We reject the hypothesis if the p-value is smaller or equal to the significance
    level (ex: 0.05). We can accept the null hypothesis, which means that the variable
    has a normal distribution, if the p-value is greater than the significance level.'
