    must do so with a hacker mentality. I have collected a short list of 5 resources
    to help newcomers find their bearings, all of which are free. Hopefully it is
    useful to some.

    scenario classification through data fusion from different external and internal
    sensors. We examine different algorithms used for self-driving cars.

- en: Recent years have witnessed amazing progress in AI related fields such as computer
    vision, machine learning and autonomous vehicles. As with any rapidly growing
    field, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay up-to-date or enter
    the field as a beginner. While several topic specific survey papers have been
    written, to date no general survey on problems, datasets and methods in computer
    vision for autonomous vehicles exists. This paper attempts to narrow this gap
    by providing a state-of-the-art survey on this topic. Our survey includes both
    the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state-of-the-art
    on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation,
    tracking, scene understanding and end-to-end learning.

    theme of building a self-driving car. It is open to beginners and is designed
    for those who are new to machine learning, but it can also benefit advanced researchers
    in the field looking for a practical overview of deep learning methods and their
    application.

    formal training/education one can currently receive in the area of autonomous
    vehicles. I say **probably** because I don't have first hand experience, but I
    also do not see any other potential claimant to that crown a the moment. The courseware
    is free to access, while enrolling in the nanodegree credential will cost some
    money.
