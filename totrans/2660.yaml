- en: Transparency, explainability, and trust are big and pressing topics in AI/ML
    today. Nobody wants to find themselves at the receiving end of a black box system
    that makes consequential decisions (e.g., about jobs, healthcare, citizenship,
    etc.), especially if those decisions are unfair, biased, or just plainly not in
    our favor. And most organizations agree that [consumer trust and confidence that
    AI is being used ethically and transparently are keys to unlocking its true potential](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/consumer-trust-ai-potential/).

    the launch of their public AI registers. The two registers were developed in collaboration
    with [Saidot.ai](https://www.saidot.ai/), an innovative Finnish company that specializes
    in “bringing transparency to consumer services” (*ibid*) and which, to the best
    of my knowledge, is the only vendor in this space.

    applications impact citizens and their everyday lives, how they were built, which
    data and algorithms they use,  what kinds of decisions and assumptions were made
    in the design, build, and deployments of the apps, and which ethical principles
    were employed to mitigate biases and risks. The registers also include contact
    information, including email addresses, phone numbers, and persons or teams to
    contact for further inquiries or provide feedback.

    trust, there is no use for AI.”](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c8abedb10ed656ecfb65fd9/5f6f334b49d5444079726a79_AI%20Registers%20-%20White%20paper%201.0.pdf)

    awareness, participation, and public debate, which are cornerstones of democratic
    governments. They build trust by increasing transparency in how, where, and why
    the governments use their data, taxpayers’ money, and new technologies, such as
    AI/ML.

    examples – let’s document and make public/ share with employees and partners what
    we are using AI/ML and data science for and how. We’ll all benefit from this disclosure.
