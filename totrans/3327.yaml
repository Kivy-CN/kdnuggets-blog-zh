    and data science ebooks? Right? Right?

- en: Here is a quick collection of such books to start your fair weather study off
    on the right foot. The list begins with a base of statistics, moves on to machine
    learning foundations, progresses to a few bigger picture titles, has a quick look
    at an advanced topic or 2, and ends off with something that brings it all together.
    A mix of classic and contemporary titles, hopefully you find something new (to
    you) and of interest here.

    readers behind chapters of slow, mathematical analysis. The typical text on Bayesian
    inference involves two to three chapters on probability theory, then enters what
    Bayesian inference is. Unfortunately, due to mathematical intractability of most
    Bayesian models, the reader is only shown simple, artificial examples. This can
    leave the user with a so-what feeling about Bayesian inference. In fact, this
    was the author's own prior opinion.

- en: Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with
    far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning,
    and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides
    a theoretical account of the fundamentals underlying machine learning and the
    mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms.
    Following a presentation of the basics, the book covers a wide array of central
    topics unaddressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational
    complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important
    algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks,
    and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the
    PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds.

    framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather
    than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics.
    It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data
    mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning
    (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks,
    support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive
    treatment of this topic in any book.

    the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with
    detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings,
    and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.

    researchers of the future will be involved with using computers to understand
    and extract usable information from massive data arising in applications, not
    just how to make computers useful on specific well-defined problems. With this
    in mind we have written this book to cover the theory likely to be useful in the
    next 40 years, just as an understanding of automata theory, algorithms, and related
    topics gave students an advantage in the last 40 years.

    book, I encourage you to work through the exercises and experiment with the Python
    code I provide. I hope you will be actively involved in trying out and programming
    data mining techniques. The textbook is laid out as a series of small steps that
    build on each other until, by the time you complete the book, you have laid the
    foundation for understanding data mining techniques.
