- en: Recently, [an interesting paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7722) introduced
    [OpenML](http://www.openml.org) which may provide an alternative way to mine the
    data. Don’t get confused. There is an OpenML which is a standard programming environment
    of digital media. What I introduce here is another OpenML, just as its name implies,
    an open science platform where machine learning researchers can share all their
    datasets, algorithms and experiments. Its logo consists of four colors, each of
    which represents an important part of OpenML.

    for machine learning – mushroom database, spam e-mail, letter image recognition,

    want to play with data. All these tasks are divided into four types, Supervised
    Classification, Learning Curve, Supervised Data Stream Classification, and Supervised
    Regression, depending on what kinds of results are expected to be shared. Tasks
    can be downloaded and solved by all users.'

    workflows or scripts that solve OpenML tasks, often through a plugin. Scientists
    can also upload the actual code or reference it by URL, if the code is hosted
    on GitHub or other open source platforms. On each flow page, results of all tasks
    the flow has run on will be compared.'

    obtain the required output is called a run. Take Run 24980 as an example. It performs
    *Flow weka.Bagging_SMO_PolyKernel(1)* on *task 36*, which is a *supervised classification* on
    data set *segment*. It also provides evaluation results, like AUC, confusion matrix,
    predictive accuracy, etc. People can easily compare results of all runs on the

- en: It is worth mentioning that OpenML can be integrated in other machine learning
    tools, like Weka, R, so that people can automatically upload data and code. For
    example, in Weka, we can add a number of tasks and Weka algorithms to run. The
    plugin will download all data, run every algorithm on every task, and then automatically
    upload the results to OpenML. Manual run upload is under development currently.
    People can only upload runs using plugins or API (Java/R).

- en: The benefit of open source platform grows faster as more people use it. When
    people start to get familiar with OpenML, the above numbers will increase for
    sure, or may be increasing when you are reading this post. One obvious benefit
    of OpenML is that researchers can define their own tasks and also build algorithms
    to solve other tasks. All shared results are stored and organized online for easy
    access, reuse and discussion.

- en: You may think of Kaggle, where people can also download data sets and evaluate
    different algorithms. However, OpenML is designed for sharing and comparing research
    results. It focuses on collaboration, instead of competition. It is a good idea
    to present machine learning skills by winning a Kaggle competition. But OpenML
    will be a place to make discoveries as long as enough runs are performed.
