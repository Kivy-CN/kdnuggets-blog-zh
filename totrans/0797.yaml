    language you use for this task, you find that there are a few major topics of
    your newly chosen discipline to which most of what you are being exposed could
    be categorized.

    the language); commands (putting the vocabulary together into useful ways); flow
    control (how we guide the order of command execution); algorithms (the steps we
    take to solve specific problems... how did this become such a confounding word?);
    and, finally, data structures (the virtual storage depots that we use for data
    manipulation during the execution of algorithms (which are, again... a series
    of steps).

    we must obviously have an existing understanding of the underlying concepts of
    machine learning, as Scikit-learn is nothing more than a practical tool for implementing
    machine learning principles and related tasks. Machine learning is a subset of
    artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience
    without being explicitly programmed. The algorithms use training data to make
    predictions or decisions by uncovering patterns and insights.
