    Most machine learning models are guided by human-annotated data, but most machine
    learning books and courses focus on algorithms. You can often get state-of-the-art
    results with good data and simple algorithms, but you rarely get state-of-the-art
    results from the best algorithm with bad data. So if you need to go deep in one
    area of machine learning first, you could argue that the data side is more important.'

    in the data. There are many demographic biases that can lead to people being under-represented,

    too: if people are under-represented across multiple demographics, then sometimes

    sufficient data for detecting emotion in children, detecting emotion in people
    from under-represented ethnicities, and detecting emotion in people on the autism
    spectrum. People without immersive experience tend to be really poor at recognizing
    emotions in these children, which limits who can provide the training data that
    says when a child really *is* happy or upset. Even some trained child physicians
    have difficulties accurately annotating data when addressing the intersectionality
    of ability, age, and/or ethnicity. Fortunately, we found that a child’s own parents
    were the best judge of their emotions, so we created interfaces for parents to
    quickly accept/reject a model’s prediction of the child’s mood. This allowed us
    to get as much training data as possible while minimizing the time and technical
    expertise that parents needed to provide that feedback. Those children’s parents
    turned out to be the perfect subject matter experts to tune our systems to their
    child’s needs.

    where you can’t run A/B tests? Synthetic control methods are a technique that

    When a school tries some new method to improve their students’ learning environment,
    they can’t be expected to improve only half the students’ lives so that the other
    half can be a statistical control group. Instead, education researchers might
    create a “synthetic control group” of schools that are most similar in terms of
    the student demographics and performance. I took this strategy, and we applied
    it at Airbnb when I was leading data science there. For example, when Airbnb was
    rolling out a product or policy change in a new city/market and could not run
    an experiment, we would create a synthetic control group of the most similar cities/markets.
    We could then measure the impact of our models compared to the synthetic controls
    for metrics like engagement, revenue, user ratings, and search relevance. Synthetic
    controls allowed us to take a data-driven approach to measuring the impact of
    our models, even where we didn’t have evaluation data.

    too often “Why bother? Annotations aren’t very expensive to collect, so even if
    your tool is twice as fast, that’s still not that valuable.” This viewpoint is
    problematic. First, many projects need buy-in from subject matter experts such
    as lawyers, doctors, or engineers who will be doing much of the annotation. More
    fundamentally, even if you’re not paying people much, you still care about their
    work and people can’t give you good work if you set them up to fail. Bad annotation
    processes often force workers to switch focus between the example, the annotation
    scheme, and the interface. This requires active concentration and is quickly exhausting.

    we don’t have that luxury. For example, we can’t collect large amounts of medical
    images related to rare diseases. Labeling of such images further requires domain
    expertise, which poses even more challenges. Real-world systems need both AI technologists
    and domain experts collaborating closely to inspire research, provide data & analysis,
    and develop algorithms to solve the problem.

    long after you go into production. If you don’t take the time to factor in refining

    who have worked on the data side of machine learning in their careers — but the
    timing of the book and limited chapters meant that only so many experts could
    be included. Given more time, additional role models might include [Alyona Medelyan](https://www.medelyan.com/), [Aman
    Naimat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amannaimat/), [Fang Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fangcheng/), [Hilary
    Mason](https://hilarymason.com/), [Ivan Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iylee/), [John
    Akred](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnakred/), [Mark Sears](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msears/),
    and [Monica Rogati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrogati/). There are a dozen more
    people who also come to mind, including people who don’t meet the criteria I used
    for the book but are still role models. Thanks also to [Emmanuel Ameisen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ameisen/) for
    the inspiration to invite and feature experts on my book. I got the idea after
    he did this for his book, [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/).

    paths are available. Just like most courses focus on algorithms, most lists of
    machine learning leaders focus on algorithm researchers. The diversity of the
    experts’ backgrounds in this article shows that there are many possible career
    paths to leadership in machine learning, with backgrounds in education, linguistics,
    UI development, physics, and many other areas outside of computer science. Therefore,
    if you are working on the data side of machine learning and you don’t have a computer
    science background, you shouldn’t feel like an outsider. Working on data-related
    problems in machine learning is necessary for a successful career and is a common
    path to leadership.

    learn from these expert anecdotes. If you do buy the book, I am donating all author
    proceeds to initiatives for better datasets, especially for low-resource languages
    and for health and disaster response, so you will be contributing to good causes.
    Although it wasn’t part of the criteria for selection, all the experts have worked
    on applications with clear positive impact on the world, so it was delight to
    give these 11 role models for good leadership more recognition in my book!
