- en: ‘Generative AI’ is the next buzzword that’s going around at the moment. Regardless
    of what sector you’re working in, you’ve definitely heard the word. It has shown
    us in the past 6 months alone the significant advancements in artificial intelligence
    (AI). It has reshaped various industries, and everybody wants to get their hands
    on it.

    of AI, and this is the point of this article.

- en: Traditional AI - a part of AI in which the majority of non-technically inclined
    people know. Also known as Narrow or Weak AI, the traditional form of AI focuses
    on performing a specific task in an intelligent manner.

- en: So what we know of traditional AI are voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa
    who are designed to respond to an input and produce an output. The way in which
    this is doable is by these AI systems learning from data, characteristics, and
    more to make decisions and predictions.

    up rules as it goes, it knows all the rules and uses this to make its next move.
    It’s a pre-defined strategy.

    a specific set of rules that it falls back on each time.

    rules.

- en: Now, onto the buzzword ‘Generative AI’. As you can imagine, I have emphasised
    that Traditional AI is based on rules and cannot create something new. So, where
    does that leave Generative AI?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, you’re right. Generative AI has the ability to create something new. Just
    like traditional AI, generative AI has learned a lot of data and is using this
    to make decisions and predictions. But rather than it being a simple input and
    output process.
  prefs: []

- en: Generative AI takes the input, understands it, and creates something new using
    the information from the input. It is trained on data and learns the underlying
    patterns to be able to generate new data based on the input information that is
    similar to the training data.

- en: To date, you can use Generative AI to create outputs in different forms such
    as text, image, and music, as well as use it to help you with tasks such as code
    completion.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: As I mentioned prior, traditional AI is based on receiving an input and producing
    an output. Input data is analysed and used to make decisions and predictions.
    If you’re looking for pattern recognition, traditional AI is your go-to. Traditional
    AI is still very popular and is used to power a lot of current AI systems, such
    as chatbots and predictive analytics. It focuses on task-specific applications,
    which a lot of people use for their day-to-day tasks.

- en: On the other hand, generative AI will go above and beyond and create new data,
    which is similar to training data. If you’re looking for pattern creation, generative
    AI is your go-to. Generative AI is opening new doors for companies to be more
    creative and innovative. It can drastically reduce the amount of time spent on
    tasks such as the ideation process. It can write song lyrics, write articles,
    and create deepfakes. Where creation and innovation are important, generative
    AI has a high potential of taking it to the next level.

    need to understand that their functions cannot be intertwined just yet. For example,
    generative AI can be used with traditional AI to provide more effective solutions.
    On the other hand, traditional AI can provide a specific output that could be
    further analysed to create personalised content using generative AI.

    world of AI is important. They are both shaping our future and are both highly
    embraced in today's society.
