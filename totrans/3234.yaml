- en: Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classification
    or regression models via a meta-classifier or a meta-regressor. The base level
    models are trained based on a complete training set, then the meta-model is trained
    on the outputs of the base level model as features.

- en: The base level often consists of different learning algorithms and therefore
    stacking ensembles are often heterogeneous. The algorithm below summarizes stacking.

- en: The stacking ensemble is illustrated in the figure above. It consists of k-NN,
    Random Forest, and Naive Bayes base classifiers whose predictions are combined
    by Logistic Regression as a meta-classifier. We can see the blending of decision
    boundaries achieved by the stacking classifier. The figure also shows that stacking
    achieves higher accuracy than individual classifiers and based on learning curves,
    it shows no signs of overfitting.

    For example, the first place for the Otto Group Product Classification challenge
    was won by a stacking ensemble of over 30 models whose output was used as features
    for three meta-classifiers: XGBoost, Neural Network, and Adaboost. See the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge/discussion/14335) for
    details.'

- en: In addition to the methods studied in this article, it is common to use ensembles
    in deep learning by training diverse and accurate classifiers. Diversity can be
    achieved by varying architectures, hyper-parameter settings, and training techniques.
