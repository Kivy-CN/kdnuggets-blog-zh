    machine learning algorithm to use, a choice which can have a seemingly out-sized
    effect on model performance and efficiency. This selection can even determine
    the success of the most basic of predictive tasks: whether a model is able to
    sufficiently learn from training data and generalize to new sets of data. This
    is especially important for data science practitioners and students, who face
    an overwhelming number of potential choices as to which algorithm to run with.
    The goal of this article is to help demystify the process of selecting the proper
    machine learning algorithm, concentrating on "traditional" algorithms and offering
    some guidelines for choosing the best one for your application.'

    improve a model''s ability to predict accurately. The wrong choice of algorithm,
    as you might be able to guess, can lead to suboptimal model performance, perhaps
    not even reaching the threshold of being useful. This results in a substantial
    potential advantage: selecting the "right" algorithm which matches the statistics
    of the data and problem will allow a model to learn well and provide outputs more
    accurately, possibly in less time. Conversely, picking the incorrect algorithm
    can have a wide range of negative consequences: training times might be longer;
    training might be more computationally expensive; and, worst of all, the model
    could be less reliable. This could mean a less accurate model, poor results when
    given new data, or no actual insights into what the data can tell you. Doing poorly
    on any or all of these metrics can ultimately be a waste of resources and can
    limit the success of the entire project.'

    selection. Factors such as the size of the dataset, the type of data elements
    contained, whether the data is structured or unstructured, are all top-level factors.
    Imagine employing an algorithm for structured data to an unstructured data problem.
    You probably won't get very far! Large datasets would need scalable algorithms,
    while smaller ones may do fine with simpler models. And don't forget the quality
    of the data — is it clean, or noisy, or maybe incomplete — owing to the fact that
    different algorithms have different capabilities and robustness when it comes
    to missing data and noise.

    clustering, or something else, obviously impacts the selection of an algorithm.
    There are particular algorithms that are best suited for each class of problem,
    and there are many algorithms that simply do not work for other problem types
    whatsoever. If you were working on a classification problem, for example, you
    might be choosing between logistic regression and support vector machines, while
    a clustering problem might lead you to using k-means. You likely would not start
    with a decision tree classification algorithm in an attempt to solve a regression
    problem.

    must ensure that the selected algorithm can accommodate. And don't overlook additional
    non-traditional metrics such as training time and model interpretability. Though
    some models might train more quickly, they may do so at the cost of accuracy or
    interpretability.
