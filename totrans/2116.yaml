    responses?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before diving in, let’s try to visualize the importance of this field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine you're having a conversation with a friend. The normal thing you would
    expect is that when you ask a question, they give you an answer right away, and
    the dialogue flows effortlessly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This smooth exchange is what users expect as well when interacting with Large
    Language Models (LLMs). Imagine chatting with ChatGPT and having to wait for a
    of couple minutes every time we send a prompt, nobody would use it at all, at
    least I wouldn’t for sure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMOps, short for Large Language Model Operations, is the behind-the-scenes
    magic that ensures LLMs function efficiently and reliably. It represents an advancement
    from the familiar MLOps, specifically designed to address the unique challenges
    posed by LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While MLOps focuses on managing the lifecycle of general machine learning models,
    LLMOps deals specifically with the LLM-specific requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using models from entities like OpenAI or Anthropic through web interfaces
    or API, LLMOps work behind the scenes, making these models accessible as services.
    However, when deploying a model for a specialized application, LLMOps responsibility
    relies on us.

    moderator keeps the conversation running smoothly and aligned to the debate’s
    topic, always making sure there are no bad words and trying to avoid fake news,
    LLMOps ensures that LLMs operate at peak performance, delivering seamless user
    experiences and checking the safety of the output.

    smaller pieces (tokens). Then, any typos or weird characters are cleaned up, and
    the text is formatted consistently.

    the bigger picture. This might involve referencing past conversations you've had
    with the LLM or using outside information.
