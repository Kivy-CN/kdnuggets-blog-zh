    You''ve got your more traditional methods like textbooks. You''ve got your fancy
    newfangled approaches like MOOCs and video lectures on YouTube. Podcasts, blogs,
    Quora questions (and sometimes answers), and research papers abound! But [Chris
    Albon](https://twitter.com/chrisalbon) has created and shared a way more cool
    way to reinforce your machine learning learning (not to be confused with learning
    reinforcement learning): the flashcard.'

    hashtag on Twitter or lurking in other social nooks around the web. You would
    even be forgiven for overlooking it, what with all the other options available,
    and everything else bombarding you in your social feeds.

    being in the market for machine learning flashcards, as it were, I didn't pay
    much attention. Until I did. When I checked out [the flashcards' website](http://machinelearningflashcards.com/),
    I realized how awesome they were in their simplicity, what with their hand-drawn
    charm, "honesty," and useful concision.

    scientific computing, and mathematics. There are hundreds of concepts to learn.
    These flashcards are designed to help you memorize key concepts in machine learning
    rapidly and enjoyably.
