    to mimic human traits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ANI often known as weak AI or narrow AI, focuses on specific applications or
    tasks. It is designed to execute single tasks and tries to imitate human actions
    within a confined range of variables, limits, and scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AGI also known as strong AI or deep AI, refers to machines’ capability to understand,
    learn, and use intelligence to address complex issues similarly to humans. AGI
    operates on a ‘theory of mind’ framework, enabling it to perceive emotions, beliefs,
    and thought processes in other intelligent entities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AGI remains a theoretical concept but has garnered significant interest from
    major tech firms. Microsoft, for instance, invested $1 billion in AGI through
    OpenAI. Today we already have ChatGPT-4, with its ability to tackle a wide range
    of problems and demonstrate higher-level cognitive skills, representing an early
    form of AGI.
