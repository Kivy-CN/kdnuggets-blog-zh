    possibilities of shifting from a model-centric approach to data-centric AI development.
    To keep pace with the momentum around data-centric approaches to AI projects,
    we have extracted insightful information from industry leaders and think tanks
    from across the globe.

- en: Over the last several decades, the dominant paradigm for AI development was
    a model or a software-centric approach. For building a machine learning system,
    you need to, both, write code to implement them to your algorithms and model,
    and take the code and train on data to extract meaningful insights. For the last
    several decades, most of us downloaded the data set, held the data set as fixed,
    and then modified the software code to understand the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nonetheless, the last few years observed tremendous progress in neural networks
    and other algorithms (thanks to this paradigm of machine learning research). And
    because of that, the open-source codes on many applications are becoming a supportive
    collaborator for some and non-supportive for others. For instance, [GitHub](https://github.com/ydataai/awesome-data-centric-ai)
    is an excellent example of open-source software, proven handy for some, but not
    for others. You may be wondering why is that so? Well, the application of the
    system comes into play here!

    approach even if we can even hold the code fix. Instead, we should manoeuvre our
    focus on generating or creating the right data to feed to the learning algorithm.
    Landing AI, founded by the celebrated computer scientist and technology entrepreneur
    Andrew Ng has been working on a data-centric MLOps platform for computer vision
    for a couple of years. Ng is a strong believer in the data-centric concept and
    a deep learning enthusiast. The concepts backed by Ng have garnered significant
    attraction in the technical community. The concept of synergising Data Science
    and AI is practically coming into practice among industry giants.

    The [community](http://datacentricai.community/) support has been tremendous,

    encouraging others to jump in and adapt the concept in practice.

    is a handful of experts carrying out the practice intuitively.
  prefs: []

- en: For example, take the rise of deep learning. For a long time, there were a handful
    of people coding up neural networks in C++ in a very raw and manual way. Eventually,
    the ideas of neural networks became more widespread and many began coding up neural
    networks in C++. Somewhere between 2015/2016, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow
    and PyTorch were introduced, making the application of these ideas more systematic
    and less error-pro. In the case of data-centric AI, there have been a bunch of
    people doing it intuitively for years.

    dominate the machine learning ecosystem. Tech geeks are now intuitively able to
    engineer speech and NLP data. Data-centric AI is becoming the next big thing,

    will be enjoying hands-on experience using mature tools making the application
    of these ideas much more repeatable, smooth, and systematic.

- en: Sometimes, the thought of working on the data, or to simply put data cleaning,
    is considered a pre-processing step. You may have heard people say things like
    that! But with a data-centric AI approach, improving the data is not a pre-processing
    step that you do once. It is a real repetitive work of algorithm training and
    learning.
  prefs: []

- en: Data improvement is a core part of the iterative process of model development.
    Experts believe it is best practice to monitor and maintain the model post-multi-development
    and deployment. Continuing to improve the data systematically is also a core part
    of the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.

    Acquiring and preparing quality data covers 80% of the ML process; whereas, the
    training part takes the remaining 20%. But that does not mean the training part
    is any less insignificant than the latter.

    learning holds significant importance. Surveys and research suggest how labelling
    and data annotation is important for accurate and innovative AI, as well as getting
    complementary or external data, or even generate new one — [synthetic data](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic).
