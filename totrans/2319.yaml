    or numbers. Permutation matters in math-centric disciplines, such as statistics,
    but it also impacts the predictions made by neural networks. Here’s a closer look.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scientists often find themselves in cases where they need to learn more
    about the population that serves as their source of information. Still, they must
    determine statistical significance. Running permutation tests is [a practical
    way to get it](/2021/12/use-permutation-tests.html) when working with time-series
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A permutation test estimates the population distribution. After getting that
    information, a data scientist can determine the rarity of observed values relative
    to the population. Permutation tests provide a sample of all possible permutations
    without replacing any values.

- en: They also have high effectiveness, even with small sample sizes. Thus, permutation
    tests can help people determine whether their neural network model uncovered a
    statistically significant finding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These tests can also help people determine how much they can trust a model’s
    results. Gauging accuracy can be extremely important, depending on the model’s
    use. People must have high confidence in a model’s performance before applying
    it to medical diagnoses or financing decisions.

- en: Many neural networks rely on black box models. They’re incredibly accurate across
    a wide range of applications. However, it [usually takes work to see predictors'
    impact](/2021/06/from-scratch-permutation-feature-importance-ml-interpretability.html)
    on the ultimate predictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An option called permutation feature importance offers a way around that obstacle.
    It shows data scientists which data set features have predictive power, regardless
    of the model used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Techniques for determining feature importance in a model allow people to rank
    predictors based on their relative predictive power. Random permutations come
    into play by showing whether a shuffling of features causes a decrease in a prediction’s
    accuracy.

    associated with the original predictor did not have a major impact in generating
    the overall prediction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People can continue ranking model predictors until they have a collection of
    values that show [which features matter the most](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning-explainability-using-permutation-importance/)
    and least for generating accurate predictions. Data scientists can also use permutation
    feature importance to debug their models and get better insights into overall
    performance.

    them and question the associated conclusions. Many professionals learned that
    mindset in grade school within STEM curriculums. The permutation is a necessary
    aspect of neural network predictions because it shapes what information the model
    does or doesn’t provide. Familiarity with permutations helps data scientists build
    and tweak the models their employers or clients want and expect.

    customers click through websites. A decision-maker may want information about
    how many customers take specific routes through a site. The model must calculate
    permutations.

- en: On the other hand, someone requesting the machine learning model might want
    to know about people visiting certain groups of pages on the site. Such insights
    relate to combinations rather than permutations. Narrowing down precisely what
    information a person wants from a neural network model helps determine the kind
    to use and to what extent permutations factor into it.

    contains information relevant](https://rehack.com/featured/artificial-intelligence-neural-networks-and-how-they-work/)
    to the questions people want to answer. Google’s machine learning engineers are
    also [working on so-called permutation-invariant](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/11/permutation-invariant-neural-networks.html)
    neural network agents. When each of an agent’s sensory neurons receives input
    from the environment, it figures out the meaning and context in the moment.

    neural network agents perform well even when models have redundant or noisy information.
