- en: Machine learning has made a significant shift from academia to industry in the
    last decade. The combination of large datasets, computing resources and significant
    investments have allowed researchers to push state-of-the-art results on most
    machine learning benchmarks.

    from a variety of companies and research institutes. We asked them about their
    processes and their team dynamics. While we’re working to release a comprehensive
    post with our analysis, one particular data point stood out to us:'

- en: The underlying issue isn’t best practices or lack of discipline, it’s the current
    state of tooling. GIT and other code version control systems are designed for
    software and not machine learning. They’re not designed to track datasets, results
    and other artifacts.
