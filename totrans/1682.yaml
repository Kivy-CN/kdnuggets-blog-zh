- en: Women are underrepresented in STEM fields - science, technology, engineering,
    and math. For instance, women made up 27% of people employed in computer and mathematical
    occupations in 1960\. But instead of growing over several decades, as many more
    women participated in the workforce overall, that number had declined to 26% by
    2013, according to a [2015 analysis of US Census data](http://www.aauw.org/research/solving-the-equation/).

    let your fear about your own abilities or a fear that you might be an impostor
    or something have any bearing on the kinds of decisions that you make. You should
    just take that part of your brain and say thank you for sharing and just put it
    aside. We all have that part of our brain and if I''d listened to that part of
    my brain I would have had a very boring life." Chayes holds a PhD in Mathematical
