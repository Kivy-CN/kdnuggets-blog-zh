    in school and adopt an active one instead. School taught you that learning came
    from sit-down-and-listen consumption. The philosophy: Go to class. Listen to the
    teacher. Repeat what they say on the test. That’s nonsense.*'

    taught to approach school. Listen to the teacher. Answer the question. Advance.

    If you're willing to put in the work, there's no reason why anyone is more capable
    than you to understand your business. Most of what we do in the business world
    is not *that *hard. I don’t intend to downplay some of the challenging questions
    we all grapple with at work - every business is complex in its own way. And building
    a business is hard work. However, what’s important is knowing that you are capable
    of understanding any business just as well as anyone else - *so long as you’re
    willing to put in the work.*

    find them. One easy hack I used to start this shift early in my career: I maintained
    a list of every unanswered question I’d overhear in meetings, calls, lunch, etc.
    The more I heard the question, the higher signal it was important to answer. Then
    go answer the question (or solve the problem) without being asked to do so.'

    the decision and accountable for the results. This is a forcing function to make
    you gather all the information necessary, consider every alternative, and remain
    unbiased. Take extreme ownership over the results.

- en: As I developed and practiced these mindsets, I found that I was given significantly
    more responsibility and resources. And I think it’s because the more that you
    demonstrate that you can find opportunities and solve problems, the more folks
    will say - “hey, let’s give that person more resources!” In doing so, you act
    for the job you want, not the one you have.
