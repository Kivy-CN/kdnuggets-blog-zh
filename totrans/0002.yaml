- en: The [FLUX.1](https://blackforestlabs.io/flux-1/) is a new family of image generation
    models created by BlackForestLabs. It is setting a new standard for the AI industry
    by delivering high image detail, strict adherence to prompts, diverse styles,
    and complex scene rendering. This model establishes itself as the state-of-the-art
    solution for transforming text into vivid imagery.

    [schnell]. It surpasses leading models like Midjourney v6.0 and DALL·E 3 (HD),
    setting a new standard in image generation and paving the way for future innovations
    in generative media.'
