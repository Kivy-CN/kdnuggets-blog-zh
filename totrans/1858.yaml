    project arose because one of the most common questions I am asked is: *“how do
    I obtain a position as a data scientist?”* It is not just the regularity of this
    question that got my attention, but also the diverse backgrounds from where it
    was coming from. To name a few, I have had this conversation with: software engineers,
    database developers, data architects, actuaries, mathematicians, academics (of
    various disciplines), biologists, astronomers, theoretical physicists – I could
    go on. And through these conversations, it has become apparent that there is a
    huge amount of misinformation out there, which has left people confused about
    what they need to do, in order to break into this field.'

    the BS and provide a useful resource for anyone looking to move into commercial
    data science – whether you are just starting out, or already possess all the necessary
    skills but have no industry experience. And so I set out with the aim of answering
    two very broad questions:'

    and to be an effective recruiter, I need to understand career paths, what makes
    a good data scientist, and what employers look for when hiring. So I already possess
    some knowledge on the matter. But I also wanted to find out directly from those
    who have trodden this path, so I began speaking with data scientists of different
    backgrounds to see what I could unearth. And this took me on a journey through
    ex-software engineers, an ex-astrophysicist and even an ex-particle physicist,
    who – to my excitement – had been involved in one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs
    of the 21st century.

    your way. But now you have another choice, which is: *what kind of data scientist
    do you want to become*? Because – it is important to acknowledge – while data
    science as a profession has been recognised for a number of years now, there still
    isn’t a commonly accepted definition of *what it actually is*.

    it comes in many forms, with the specific demands dependent on the industry, the
    business, and the purpose/output of the role in question. As a result, certain
    skillsets suit certain positions better than others, and this is why the path
    to data science is not uniform and can be via a diverse range of fields such as
    statistics, computer science and other scientific disciplines.

    in ‘data science’, because – in a sense – all scientists are data scientists,
    as they all work with data in one form or another. But to take what is generally
    considered to be data science in industry, what actually makes it a science? Great
    question! The answer should be: *‘the scientific method’*. Given the multi-disciplinary
    nature of science, the scientific method is the one thing that binds the fields
    together. If you got this right, full marks to you.

    all data scientists are true scientists. Ask yourself though: can you justify
    calling yourself a scientist if your role does not involve actual science? Personally,
    I do not see what is wrong with alternatives like ‘analyst’, or whatever best
    fits the position in question. But maybe this is just me, and perhaps I would
    be better off calling myself a recruitment scientist.'

    and machine learning. But we are not talking about a power tool here; these are
    complex – and to an extent – esoteric fields, and if you do not possess expert
    knowledge, you will not be solving data science problems any time soon.

    be viewed as a multi-disciplinary field that grew out of *both* artificial intelligence/computer
    science *and* statistics. It is often seen as a subfield of AI, and while this
    is true, it is important to recognise that there is no machine learning without
    statistics (ML is heavily dependent on statistical algorithms in order to work).
    For a long time statisticians were unconvinced by machine learning, with collaboration
    between the two fields being a relatively recent development (see statistical
    learning theory), and it is interesting to note that high dimensional statistical
    learning only happened when statisticians embraced ML results (*thanks to Bhavani
    Rascutti, Advanced Analytics Domain Lead at Teradata for this input*).
