    learning spam filter. We will assume that we have a labelled dataset of N = 315
    emails, 244 of which are labelled as ***spam***, and 71 are ***not-spam***. Supposed
    that we’ve built a machine learning classification algorithm to learn from this
    data. Now we would like to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model.
    How good was the model in correctly detecting the ***spam*** vs ***not-spam***
    emails? We will assume that whenever the model predicts an email to be a ***spam***
    email, the email will be deleted and saved in the spam folder. Let’s also assume
    that the ***spam*** class is the negative class, and ***not-spam*** the positive
    class. Let’s assume the performance of the machine learning model could be illustrated
    in the table below:'

- en: For binary classification systems, the Total Error Rate is not a good metric.
    Instead, it is important to focus on the Type I and Type II error rates. In this
    illustration, it is important to keep the Type I error rate () to be low, so that
    ***spam*** emails are not incorrectly classified as normal ***not-spam*** emails
    and deleted. Similarly, it is important that the Type II error rate be minimized,
    so that normal ***not-spam*** emails are not mistaken for ***spam*** emails.
