    regression analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Students will learn
    about the fundamental mathematical concepts underlying machine learning algorithms,
    but this course will equally focus on the practical use of machine learning algorithms
    using open source libraries from the Python programming ecosystem.

    and Data Science to technical personnel (corporate, academic or students), during
    15 lectures (2 hours each). All subjects are introduced by examples that students
    are expected to immediately play with using either command-line or GUI tools.

    to power next generation AI systems, which will need to go beyond input-output
    pattern recognition (as has sufficed for speech, vision, machine translation)
    but will have to generate intelligent behavior. Example application domains include
    robotics, marketing, dialogue, HVAC, optimizing healthcare and supply chains.

    by the brain and how it could be replicated in machines—using an approach that
    integrates cognitive science, which studies the mind; neuroscience, which studies
    the brain; and computer science and artificial intelligence, which study the computations
    needed to develop intelligent machines. Materials are drawn from the Brains, Minds
    and Machines Summer Course offered annually at the Marine Biological Laboratory
