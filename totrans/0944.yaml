    a good understanding of the Empirical rule.

    a normal bell curve. When you’re working with datasets, you should always ask
    if your data is skewed. This is where Chebychev’s theorem comes into play.

- en: Chebyshev’s Theorem was proven by Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev and
    typically referred to as Chebyshev’s Inequality. It can be applied to any dataset,
    specifically ones that have a wide range of probability distributions that do
    not follow the normal distribution we all want.

    will be far from the mean. Therefore, the k-value we use is the limit we set for
    the number of standard deviations away from the mean.

- en: In Data Science, you use a lot of statistical measures to learn more about the
    dataset you are working with. The mean calculates the central tendency of a data
    set, however, this does not tell us enough about the dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a Data Scientist, you will be wondering to learn more about the dispersion
    of the data. And in order to figure this out will need to measure the standard
    deviation, which represents the difference between each value and the mean. When
    you have the mean and the standard deviation, you can learn a lot about a dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more variance we have, the more spread the distribution of data points is
    away from the mean, and the lower the variance, the less spread the distribution
    of data points is away from the mean.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a random variable has low variance, then the observed values will be grouped
    close to the mean. As shown in the image below, this results in a smaller standard
    deviation. However, if your distribution of data has a large variance, then your
    observations will naturally be more spread out and further away from the mean.
    As shown in the image below, this results in a larger standard deviation.

    as you have calculated the mean and standard deviation and it does not follow
    a normal distribution, Chebyshev’s theorem can be applied. It will be able to
    determine the proportion of data falling within a specific range of the mean.
