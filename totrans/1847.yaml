- en: For Conway, the center of the diagram is *Data Science. *There's some controversy
    over what the bottom circle means (I'll address it farther down); all I can say,
    is if Conway meant something other than what I would call domain knowledge (e.g.
    physics), he chose the name *Substantive Expertise* very poorly. So assuming domain
    knowledge is at least part of what he meant, the idea is that a physicist, say,
    would have expertise in physics and math/stats knowledge, but lack hacking knowledge
    (I've met many physicists and I think that's less true than it used to be). *Machine
    Learning* experts tend to apply algorithms without an understanding of the domain
    they're analyzing (that sure as heck was my case when I first started building
    models in an industry that was totally new to me; I had to play a lot of catchup).
    And then people who can program and know their field but have no way to tell a
    statistically significant result from one arising from sheer coincidence are dangerous;
    they can arrive at some drastically wrong solutions and, for example, lose their
    companies lots of money.

    should apply to that **entire **circle, and the part that doesn't intersect with
    anything should be labeled, e.g. "hackers". But that's a fairly minor point, it's
    obvious what he's getting across.

    the way. Despite that, *Data Mining* also has its own circle. I do appreciate
    what he did here, though, implying what makes data science worthy of its own field
    is the breadth of its required skills. Apparently one of those skills is *Neurocomputing,* which
    seems a little... specific.

    he''s moved *Data Science* where *Machine Learning* was in Conway''s -- that''s
    an interesting distinction, and one I''ve seen in the field. There are data scientists

    to products, but the categorizations are noteworthy (and they follow true Venn
    methodology, not being slices in themselves). *Domain Knowledge* remains, *Computer
    Science/Hacking* remains as *Software Engineering,* and crucially, Harris has
    added *Predictive Analytics* and *Visualization* to the*Statistics* circle. But
    not the actual tools they use, that's in the intersection with *Software Engineering.* Okay.

    he's getting at. When I first heard people referred to as data scientists, I often
    heard the riposte, "Aren't all scientists, by definition, data scientists?" True,
    there are no sciences that do not deal in data (insert psychiatry joke here),
    but still, data science, while quite nebulous, isn't just an umbrella term.
