- en: When machine learning initially emerged, many speculated that it would spark
    another industrial revolution. Fast forward to today and many would say that it’s
    nothing more than a buzzword.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t get me wrong. Machine learning is a useful tool, but it’s nothing more
    than that. And it’s a stretch to say that it’s anything like a swiss army knife
    — I’d think of it more like a water jet (something rather niche).

- en: From my experiences, there are certainly a number of applications where machine
    learning shines. For example, [Amazon’s recommendation system increased sales
    by over 30%](https://evdelo.com/amazons-recommendation-algorithm-drives-35-of-its-sales/).
    However, there are a greater number of applications where machine learning is
    a suboptimal solution.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As seen in the [AI hierarchy of needs](https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007),
    machine learning relies on several other factors that serve as a foundation. This
    foundation encompasses everything from collecting data, storing data, moving data,
    and transforming data. It’s important that you have a robust process that achieves
    these preliminary steps or it’ll be less likely that you have reliable data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is this so important? You’ve heard of the saying “garbage in, garbage out”
    — the performance of your machine learning models are limited by the quality of
    your data, which is why it’s so important that you have reliable data to start
    with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only do you need your data to be **reliable**, but you need **enough **data
    to leverage the power of machine learning. Without these two criteria checked
    out, you won’t be able to get the full power of ML.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are two general categories of models: predictive models and explanatory
    models:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Predictive models** solely focus on the model’s ability to produce accurate
    predictions.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Explanatory models **focus more on understanding the relationships between
    the variables in the data.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine Learning models, particularly ensemble learning models and neural networks,
    are **predictive models **— they are excellent at formulating predictions and
    far exceed the predictive power of traditional models like linear/logistic regression.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That being said, when it comes to understanding the relationships between the
    predictive variables and the target variable, these models are a black box. While
    you may understand the underlying mechanics behind these models, it’s still not
    very clear how they get to their final results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And while some techniques like feature importance and correlation matrices exist,
    they are still quite limited in understanding relationships in your data. Overall,
    ML and deep learning are great for prediction, but lack in explainability.

    Particularly, there are several types of “debt” to consider when maintaining machine
    learning models:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Dependency debt: **Dependency debt refers to the debt incurred from unstable
    data dependencies and underutilized data dependencies. In simpler terms, this
    refers to the cost of maintaining multiple versions of the same model, legacy
    features, and underutilized packages.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Analysis debt**: This refers to the idea that ML systems often end up influencing
    their own behavior if they update over time, resulting in direct and hidden feedback
    loops.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Configuration debt: **The configuration of machine learning systems themselves
    also incur a debt similar to any software system. It should be easy to make small
    configurations, it should be hard to make manual errors, and it should be easy
    to see the difference between different models.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, machine learning shouldn’t be used when simpler alternatives exist that
    are equally as effective. In my previous article, *“*[*Want to be a Data Scientist,
    Don’t Start with Machine Learning*](https://towardsdatascience.com/want-to-be-a-data-scientist-dont-learn-machine-learning-28e418d9af2f)*,” *I
    emphasized the point that machine learning is not the answer to every problem.

- en: A simple solution that takes 1 week to build that is 90% accurate will **almost
    always** be chosen over a machine learning model that takes 3 months to build
    that is 95% accurate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, you should start with the simplest solution that you can implement
    and iteratively determine if the marginal benefits from the next best alternative
    outweighs the marginal costs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you can solve your problem with a Python script or a SQL query, you should
    do that first. If you can solve your problem with a decision tree, you should
    do that first. If you can solve your problem with a linear regression model, you
    should do that first.

    and how it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Do keep in mind that this is more
    of an opinionated article that is backed by anecdotal experience, so take what
    you want from this article. But as always, I wish you the best in your learning
    endeavors!
