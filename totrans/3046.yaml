  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The nodes and edges of the graph flexibly capture a high-resolution twin of
    every data source — structured or unstructured. The graph can help users answer
    any question quickly and interactively, allowing users to converse with the data
    to uncover insights.
  prefs: []

- en: In addition to making every day big data analytics problems easy the graph unlocks
    new possibilities where graph is particularly well suited. The graph, based on
    open-standards is a platform for continuous improvement. Within the graph, sources
    are quickly linked and harmonized using business rules, text analytics and even **machine
    learning (this is going to be important soon).**

    the same concept. It reminded me of the time-space fabric. I went ahead and defined
    the Data Fabric (without knowing is that what the authors mean and without reading
    other definitions).

- en: The concept of the Space-Time Fabric in Physics is a construct created to explain
    the continuous of space and time, and it’s made of four (or eleven or twenty six
    depending on the theory you are) dimensions. Inside of this construct gravity
    is a manifestation of warping the fabric of space-time.

    space as a fabric, but if you do, be aware that what you’re doing is implicitly
    reducing your perspective down to a two-dimensional analogy. Space in our Universe
    is three dimensional, and when you combine it with time, you get a four dimensional
    quantity.'

    add stuff like data cleansing, transformation, linking and access control — dynamically
    enhancing the in-memory graph in an iterative manner.

    easily turn layers on or off, and remove, copy and create layers as needed.

    them against the complex graph makes extracting features easy and eventually fully
    automated!

    their data — quickly and easily pivoting to take the analysis in new directions
    based on the answers to questions, without specialized query knowledge, they can
    traverse even the most complicated multi-dimensional data on the way to building
    exploratory charts, filters, tables and even network views.
