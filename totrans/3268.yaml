    use these features to determine how to classify a particular item.

- en: Formally defined, each item is called **“input vector”**. The decision to keep
    or throw each item is called **“label”** for that item. You need to provide some
    examples to the classification algorithm to **“learn”** which items to throw and
    which item to keep. This form of learning is called **“supervised learning”**
    because we *supervise* the learning done by the algorithm by providing the labels.
    In future posts, I will talk about various kinds of machine learning algorithms
    (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement
    learning) in detail.

    to apply what it has learned to the next item which it has not seen yet. For example,
    item 8.
