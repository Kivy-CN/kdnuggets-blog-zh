    how people may confuse them. Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are two
    well-used Machine Learning Algorithms that both branch off from Supervised Learning.

    is how they are being used. Linear Regression is used to solve Regression problems

    that branch from Supervised Learning and is primarily used to solve regression
    problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The use of **Linear Regression** is to make predictions on continuous dependent
    variables with the assistance and knowledge from independent variables. The overall
    goal of Linear Regression is to find the line of best fit, which can accurately
    predict the output for continuous dependent variables. Examples of continuous
    values are house prices, age, and salary.

    between one single independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight
    line. If there are more than two independent variables, we then call this Multiple
    Linear Regression.

    between the dependent and independent variable; which should be of linear nature.

    Classification tasks, however, it is mainly used for Classification. If you would

    known as mean squared error (MSE).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MSE measures the average squared difference between an observation’s actual
    and predicted values. The cost will be outputted as a single number which is associated
    with our current set of weights. The reason we use Cost Function is to improve
    the accuracy of the model; minimising MSE does this.
