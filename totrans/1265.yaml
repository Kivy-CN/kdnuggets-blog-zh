    [free resources for data science self-study](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/learning-data-science-has-never-been-easier-918cf809c343).
    As a matter of fact, you can even design your own data science curriculum from
    the innumerable amount of available resources. While knowledge acquired from course
    work is essential to lay a good foundation in data science, you need to remember
    that data science is a practical field. As such, hands-on skills are very important,
    especially if you are interested in working outside academia as a practicing data

    As a data science aspirant, GitHub should serve as the first platform that you
    use as a repository of completed projects throughout your data science journey.
    These projects could include projects from weekly assignments or capstone projects.
    This platform enables you to share your code with other data scientists or data
    science aspirants. Employers interested in hiring you would check your GitHub
    portfolio to assess some of the projects you’ve completed. So, it’s important
    for you to build a very strong and professional portfolio on GitHub.
