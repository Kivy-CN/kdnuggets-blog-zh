- en: I first met [Pedro Domingos](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/) in 1995
    at the first KDD Conference in Montreal. He was a young and serious student but
    he already impressed me then as a brilliant young researcher. He justified those
    expectations by winning many awards, including [KDD 2014 Data Mining/Data Science
    Innovation Award](/2014/07/acm-sigkdd-2014-innovation-award-pedro-domingos.html),
    the top award in the field, and he is a fellow of the Association for the Advancement
    of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

- en: Wonderfully erudite, humorous, and easy to read, the Master Algorithm takes
    you on a journey to visit the 5 tribes of Machine Learning experts (rules, evolutionary
    algorithms, bayesian, neural nets, and analogies) in search of the master algorithm.

- en: Domingos combines different ideas to build up a potential master algorithm and
    in process even manages to propose a question to the ultimate answer of "42",
    make such interesting observations that "Time is a principal component of memory",
    and propose an idea for a company that is potentially more valuable than Google
    - which holds and shares your data for you.

- en: 'Algorithms increasingly run our lives. They find books, movies, jobs, and dates
    for us, manage our investments, and discover new drugs. More and more, these algorithms
    work by learning from the trails of data we leave in our newly digital world.
    Like curious children, they observe us, imitate, and experiment. And in the world''s
    top research labs and universities, the race is on to invent the ultimate learning
    algorithm: one capable of discovering any knowledge from data, and doing anything
    we want, before we even ask.'

- en: Machine learning is the automation of discovery-the scientific method on steroids-that
    enables intelligent robots and computers to program themselves. No field of science
    today is more important yet more shrouded in mystery. Pedro Domingos, one of the
    field's leading lights, lifts the veil for the first time to give us a peek inside
    the learning machines that power Google, Amazon, and your smartphone. He charts
    a course through machine learning's five major schools of thought, showing how
    they turn ideas from neuroscience, evolution, psychology, physics, and statistics
    into algorithms ready to serve you. Step by step, he assembles a blueprint for
    the future universal learner-the Master Algorithm-and discusses what it means
    for you, and for the future of business, science, and society.

- en: If data-ism is today's rising philosophy, this book will be its bible. The quest
    for universal learning is one of the most significant, fascinating, and revolutionary
    intellectual developments of all time. A groundbreaking book, The Master Algorithm
    is the essential guide for anyone and everyone wanting to understand not just
    how the revolution will happen, but how to be at its forefront.
