- en: DBSCAN is a different type of clustering algorithm with some unique advantages.
    As the name indicates, this method focuses more on the proximity and density of
    observations to form clusters. This is very different from KMeans, where an observation
    becomes a part of cluster represented by nearest centroid. DBSCAN clustering can
    identify outliers, observations which won’t belong to any cluster. Since DBSCAN
    clustering identifies the number of clusters as well, it is very useful with unsupervised
    learning of the data when we don’t know how many clusters could be there in the
    data.

- en: K-Means clustering may cluster loosely related observations together. Every
    observation becomes a part of some cluster eventually, even if the observations
    are scattered far away in the vector space. Since clusters depend on the mean
    value of cluster elements, each data point plays a role in forming the clusters.
    Slight change in data points *might* affect the clustering outcome. This problem
    is greatly reduced in DBSCAN due to the way clusters are formed.

    within distance *n*** as a Core-Set. All the overlapping Core-Sets are grouped
    together into one cluster. Like multiple individual graphs being connected to
    form a set of connected graphs.

- en: Since clustering entirely depends on the parameters *n* and *m* (above), choosing
    these values correctly is very important. While good domain knowledge of the subject
    helps choosing good values for these parameters, there are also some approaches
    where these parameters can be fairly approximated without deep expertise in the
    domain.
