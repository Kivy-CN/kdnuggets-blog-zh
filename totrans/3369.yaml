- en: The recent explosion of interest in data science, data mining, and related disciplines
    has been mirrored by an explosion in book titles on these same topics. One of
    the best ways to decide which books could be useful for your career is to look
    at which books others are reading. This post details the 10 most popular titles
    in Amazon's [Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Books](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books-AI-Machine-Learning/zgbs/books/3887/)
    category as of Nov 24, 2016, skipping over repeated titles as well as titles which
    have been obviously miscategorized and are of no use to our readers.

    mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context.
    He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of
    machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks
    inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances,
    with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations;
    and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize
    reward and minimize penalty. Alpaydin then considers some future directions for
    machine learning and the new field of "data science," and discusses the ethical
    and legal implications for data privacy and security.
