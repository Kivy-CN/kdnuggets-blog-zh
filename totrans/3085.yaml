    on their own not to touch the hot oven” *but it’s actually a pattern-finding technique
    for mining inspiration from your data. It has nothing to do with machines running
    around without adult supervision, forming their own opinions about things. Let’s
    demystify!

    learning are far more boring: something like “*Group 1 and Group 2*” or “*A or

    human-interpretable (or poetic) meaning.'

    deliver it? This isn’t magic! If I don’t tell it what the right answers are...
    I get what I get and I don’t get upset. All I can do is look at the clusters the
    system returns for me and see if I find them inspiring. If I don’t like 'em, I
    just run a different unsupervised algorithm (“Someone else in the audience, split
    them for me a different way”) over and over until something feels interesting.
