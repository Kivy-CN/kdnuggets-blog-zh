    tone.  This sentiment is also fueled with statements made by [Bill Gates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/01/28/bill-gates-on-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-dont-understand-why-some-people-are-not-concerned/?utm_term=.43c26215dd98), [Elon
    Musk](http://fortune.com/2017/03/27/data-sheet-elon-musk-artificial-intelligence/),
    and even [Stephen Hawking](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540).  With
    all due respect, I would not stand in public talking nonsense about wormholes,
    so maybe we all should focus a bit more on our areas of expertise.

    “Linear Regression” before. This should not come as a surprise since it was [invented
    more than 200 years ago by Legendre and Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis). 
    Still, this overdose of hype can lead to situations where people get carried away
    whenever they use this method.  Here is one of my favorite tweet exchanges which
    exemplifies this:'

    help you understand the differences between these fields as well as their relationships

    like humans.  Think of the famous (although a bit outdated) [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) to
    determine if this is the case or not.  If you talk to Siri on your phone and get
    an answer, you’re already close.  Automatic trading systems using machine learning
    to be more adaptive would already fall into this category as well.'

    the extraction of patterns from data sets. This means that the machine can find
    rules for optimal behavior but also can adapt to changes in the world. Many of
    the algorithms involved have been known for decades, centuries, even. Thanks to
    the advances in computer science and parallel computing they can now scale up
    to massive data volumes.'

- en: '*Deep Learning* is a specific class of Machine Learning algorithms which use
    complex neural networks.  In a sense, it is a group of related techniques comparable
    to a group of “decision trees” or “support vector machines”.  But thanks to advances
    in parallel computing they’ve received quite a bit of hype recently, which is
    why I broke them out here. As you can see, Deep Learning is a subset of methods
    from Machine Learning.  When somebody explains that Deep Learning is “[radically
    different from Machine Learning](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/why-deep-learning-is-radically-different-from-machine-learning-945a4a65da4d)“,
    they are wrong.  If you would like to get a BS-free view on Deep Learning, check
