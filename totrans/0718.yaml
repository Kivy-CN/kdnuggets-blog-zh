    data scientist in just two weeks or two months. However, they often hide a lot
    of facts. While it's possible to become a professional data scientist in a short
    period, this usually assumes you already have a strong foundation in data science
    fundamentals like statistics, probability, SQL, and Python for data management
    and analysis, as well as various data wrangling and analysis techniques.
