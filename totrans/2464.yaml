- en: There is growing demand for machine learning (ML) engineers in the tech industry.
    Companies are trying to integrate intelligent products to boost profits and increase
    customer engagements. The upward trend of AI-related jobs on platforms like LinkedIn
    and Glassdoor suggests that companies are looking for data scientists with machine
    learning experience, ML engineers, MLOps engineers, and data engineers with a
    background in developing AI products. The world is becoming intelligent with time,
    and to meet the demand, organizations are paying a base salary of $130K+ [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/machine-learning-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,25.htm).

    start your career by completing a professional course on machine learning. Before
    taking these courses, you need to understand the prerequisites. Almost all of
    them want you to have experience in Python, Statistics, and Data Science. The
    advanced courses want you to have hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks
    and an understanding of the machine learning ecosystem. In this blog, we will
    learn about the top five free machine learning courses. The level of difficulty
    of courses ranges from beginner to advanced.

    University is the most popular and highly rated online course on the internet.
    Most of my colleagues have taken various Andrew Ng courses, and they all had positive
    experiences. If you are a beginner with the experience in Python language, I will
    highly suggest you start your journey by taking a free course by Stanford University.
    You can also pay an extra $75 to get a certificate and gain access to additional
    learning resources.'
