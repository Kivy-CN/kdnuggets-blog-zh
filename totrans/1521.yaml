- en: Data science has become a widely used term and a buzzword as well. It is a broad
    field representing a combination of multiple disciplines. However, there are adjacent
    areas that deserve proper attention and should not be confused with data science.
    One of them is decision science. Its importance should not be underestimated,
    so it is useful to know the actual differences and peculiarities of these two
    fields. Data science and decision science are related but still separate fields,
    so at some points, it might be hard to compare them directly.

    data after this data has been collected, processed, and structured by data engineer.
    Decision scientist considers data as a tool to make decisions and solve business
    problems. To demonstrate other differences, we decided to prepare an infographic
    which puts data science and decision science in contrast according to several
    criteria. Let’s dive right in.

    that uses scientific algorithms, methods, techniques and various approaches to
    extract valuable insights. Thus, its primary purpose is to reveal the insights
    from data for further application to the benefit of the various industries. In
    contrast, decision science is an application of a complex of quantitative techniques
    to the decision-making process. Its purpose is to apply the data-driven insights
    in combination with the elements of cognitive science to policies planning and
    development. So, data is equally important for both, yet the mechanisms are quite
    different.

    industries like retail, FMCG, entertainment, media, healthcare, insurance, telecommunication,
    finance, travel, manufacturing, agriculture, sports, etc. Decision science touches
    more theoretical areas of business and management, law and education, environmental
    regulation, military science, public health, and public policy.

    data scientists struggle with the problems of dirty data, difficulties in sourcing
    development, security issues, etc. Decisions scientists search for new ways to
    overcome the lack of reliable data, difficulties caused by complex data environments,
    and complexity of applied techniques. They should possess knowledge in math, finance,
    and analytics to make the right decision.

    and prospects of data science and decision science. According to our expectations,
    data science will continue its way towards automation, further evolution and extensive
    use of chatbots and virtual assistants. There will be widespread use of augmented
    reality elements, further robotization of industries and increasing popularity
    of reinforcement learning. In contrast, decision science will continue to move
    us towards automated decision-making and data empowerment. For sure, it is going
    to achieve vital importance and broad application in industries which will result
    in increasing demand in specialists.

- en: Data science can be a crucial component of decision science and quite often
    business owners rely on data science as on a solution to all their problems and
    worries. However, it is not enough to only use data science. The truth is somewhere
    in between data science and decision science.
