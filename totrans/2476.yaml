  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Concept drift occurs when there are changes in the distribution of the training
    set examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the most basic level, concept drift causes data points that were once considered
    an example of one concept to be seen as another concept entirely over time.

    concept of fraud is constantly changing.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary reason concept drift occurs is that the underlying data distribution
    in an application is constantly changing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the distributions change, the old machine learning models can no longer
    make accurate predictions and must be redefined or retrained entirely to adapt
    to these changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although this sounds like something you would never want happening in an application,
    it is the goal of many machine learning models to be updated as frequently as
    possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is because new data collected from a production environment contains valuable
    information that can help improve the accuracy of predictions made by your model.
  prefs: []

- en: The distribution of input data could change either because of external reasons
    or due to the predictions themselves. Customer purchasing behavior, for example,
    is influenced by macroeconomic trends. Yet, their behavior on your platform is

    or later.

    your model. If you don’t have a way of monitoring this drift, your accuracy will
    slowly degrade until eventually, no one trusts your predictions anymore.

    performance leakage is a data issue or a model issue.
  prefs: []

    It may be the data collection method or a genuine shift in the trend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it’s a model issue, you should look at what feature of your model may be
    causing this change in distribution. This can be caused by things like bias creeping
    into the model or even environmental changes that cause the training set to not
    match up with actual data.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Monitoring different performance metrics over time is crucial because we can
    find out about any drift by looking at them closely. Some of the critical model
    performance matrics include precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[**Precision**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall) is
    how accurate the prediction is when true positives are divided by all predictions
    made. If you look at precision over time, this indicates how much our model has
    drifted from actual data distribution to what it predicts now.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    us whether we are catching enough of the positive examples.'

    from true positives to false negatives, which are not suitable for business decisions.

    precision and recall into a single number using the harmonic mean of their values.
    If F-measure is changing along with accuracy, then this also indicates a model
    drift.'

    false positives. It can be seen as an extension of precision and recall, but it

    as possible, regular retraining proactively tries to eliminate such a situation.

    it is an investment that pays off in the long run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The frequency of retraining largely depends on the domain. In e-commerce, retraining
    models every week probably makes sense. But for fraud detection systems where
    the behavior of fraudulent users is constantly changing, you may need to retrain
    your model daily.

    drift in production. However, another way to address this problem is by using
    ensemble models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    into one final prediction that can be more accurate than any individual algorithm.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Concept drifts cause machine learning models in production to perform differently
    than they do during training. This is a big problem that can lead to bad user
    experiences or even cause models to fail if the drift is not anticipated correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common way concept drifts occur in production is when your data changes
    over time (e.g., new features are added, some existing ones removed). It’s essential
    to monitor your data and detect drift as soon as possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should also use techniques like regular retraining or ensembling to prevent
    drift in the first place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You must address machine learning drift before users start reporting bad experiences
    with your product. If this happens, it will quickly lead to a loss of trust and
    very high costs for fixing things later. Be proactive!
