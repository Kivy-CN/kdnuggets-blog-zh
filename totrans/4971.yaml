- en: Twitter provides access to analytics for all of its users, but I am assuming
    relatively few vanilla tweeples pay much attention to its existence. There are
    a variety of other services which can help perform tweet and audience analytics,
    and further analysis such as that related to geographic and natural language processing,
    but when paired with some simple Python, the Twitter-supplied data can be incredibly
    useful.

    own in Python. Unlike a lot of other tutorials which often pull from the real-time
    Twitter API, we will be using the downloadable Twitter Analytics data, and most
    of what we do will be done in Pandas.

    upper right menu (your profile pic), select **Analytics**, choose the **Tweets**
    tab along the top, use the date range pickers to select a time period, and choose
    **Export Data**. It doesn't matter how much data you use; our simple example will
    work with any amount. I chose the default, **Past 28 Days**.

- en: It's no secret that hashtags play an important role in Twitter, and mentions
    can also help grow your network and influence. Together they help put the 'social'
    in social networking, transforming platforms like Twitter from passive experiences
    to very active ones. With that, getting a handle on the most social aspect of
    this social network can be a helpful endeavour.

    prior to checking Twitter handles (this could be a problem if you have tweeps
    named both Francesco_AI and FrancescoAI), this works and is at least relatively
    Pythonic (though I'm sure it could be more so).

- en: Finally, let's have a look at some very basic temporal data. We will check mean
    impressions for tweets based -- independently -- on both the hour of day and day
    of week that they are tweeted. I caution (once gain) that this is based on very
    little data, and so nothing useful will likely be gleaned. However, given much
    larger amounts of tweet data, entire social media campaigns are planned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this is based on impressions, it could just as reasonably (and easily
    changed to) be based on engagements, or RTs, or whatever else you pleased. Working
    in advertising, and promoting tweets? Maybe you are more interested in some of
    those **promotion*** metrics we hacked off the dataset at the start.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have to convert the Twitter supplied date field to a legitimate Python datetime
    object, bin the data based on which hourly slot it falls into, identify days of
    week, and then capture this data in a couple of additional columns in the DataFrame,
    which we will pillage for stats afterward.

    tweets, 11 AM tweets, and 6 PM tweets are my bread and butter. Of course, this
    is based on 95 tweets, and so is meaningless and inconclusive. However, after
    performing these same steps on some considerably larger sets of data, some interesting
    trends have been observed which may help lead to business decisions. All from
    some simple Python.

- en: While not earth-shattering, our simple Pandas-based Twitter analytics code is
    enough to get us thinking about how we may better use social media. Applied to
    the right data, elementary scripts can be quite powerful.
