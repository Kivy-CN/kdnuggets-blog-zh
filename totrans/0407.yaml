    just your skill with numbers and Python. Being a good data scientist means that
    you have business insights. You know what the numbers mean. And you'll be relating
    those important insights to key members of your company's leadership team.

    the work you do will have a real business impact. You'll develop an algorithm
    that really affects the company's bottom line. But just as often, if not more
    so, you'll make a spreadsheet, data visualization, or just crunch some numbers
    for an exec who needs them for a presentation tomorrow. “[Y]ou have to constantly
    do ad hoc work such as getting numbers from a database to give to the right people
    at the right time, doing simple projects just so that the right people have the

    The reality, like in just about every other job, is that there's a lot of on-the-job

    you make of it. Many startups hire data scientists because their investors are
    asking for them. Tech-illiterate founders have no idea what you can do, so it’s
    up to you to figure out and define the role. (And get ready for a lot of misunderstandings
    along the way.)

    Some data scientists built that model. An even more morally gray example is Uber’s

    aren’t necessarily forces for good; they’re mostly forces for profit. Especially

    little infrastructure, and poor understanding of what you actually do. “The data
    scientist likely came in to write smart machine learning algorithms to drive insight
    but can’t do this because their first job is to sort out the data infrastructure
    and/or create analytic reports,” [writes](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-so-many-data-scientists-are-leaving-their-jobs-a1f0329d7ea4)
    Brooks-Bartlett. Especially if you’re working for a startup, you’ll often have
    to do a lot of pre-data science work to get your tools, architecture, and technology

    data scientists would have been asked to store and process data with Hadoop. A

    you’ll get asked to send over an Excel sheet with a simple VLOOKUP formula.
