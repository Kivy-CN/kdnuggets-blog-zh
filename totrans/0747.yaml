- en: Many developers and IT professionals who work in Fortune 500 companies use either
    a Linux distribution or MacOS. Why Linux? Because most servers run on Linux and
    provide a wide variety of tools that Windows 11 lacks. Also, if you are security
    and privacy-conscious, then moving to Linux is the right decision. In the past
    month, I have been trying out a few of these distributions using VM VirtualBox,
    and I am seriously considering Linux as my primary system.
