- en: Ensemble methods are learning algorithms that construct a set of classifiers
    and then classify new data points by taking a weighted vote of their predictions.
    The original ensemble method is Bayesian averaging, but more recent algorithms
    include error-correcting output coding, bagging, and boosting.

    noisy than the single opinion of one of the models. In finance, this is called
    diversification — a mixed portfolio of many stocks will be much less variable
    than just one of the stocks alone. This is why your models will be better with
    more data points rather than fewer.'

    and you are combining the predictions from each model in a simple way (average,
    weighted average, logistic regression), then there’s no room for over-fitting.

    a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of
    linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

    In computer vision, the 1st face recognition ML algorithms used PCA and SVD in
    order to represent faces as a linear combination of “eigenfaces”, do dimensionality
    reduction, and then match faces to identities via simple methods; although modern
    methods are much more sophisticated, many still depend on similar techniques.'

    latent variables, and the mixing system is also unknown. The latent variables
    are assumed non-gaussian and mutually independent, and they are called independent
    components of the observed data.
