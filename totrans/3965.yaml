- en: Statistical functions are the cornerstone for extracting meaningful insights
    from raw data. Python provides a powerful toolkit for statisticians and data scientists
    to understand and analyze datasets. Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy offer
    a comprehensive suite of functions. This guide will go over 10 essential statistical
    functions in Python within these libraries.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Three of the most widely used are NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy stats.

- en: '**NumPy:** Short for Numerical Python, this library provides support for arrays,
    matrices, and a range of mathematical functions.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Pandas:** Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library helpful for
    working with tables and time series data. It is built on top of NumPy and adds
    in additional features for data manipulation.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**SciPy stats:** Short for Scientific Python, this library is used for scientific
    and technical computing. It provides a large number of probability distributions,
    statistical functions, and hypothesis tests.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python libraries must be downloaded and imported into the working environment
    before they can be used. To install a library, use the terminal and the pip install
    command. Once it has been installed, it can be loaded into your Python script
    or Jupyter notebook using the import statement. NumPy is normally imported as
    `np`, Pandas as `pd`, and typically only the stats module is imported from SciPy.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mean, also known as the average, is the most fundamental statistical measure.
    It provides a central value for a set of numbers. Mathematically, it is the sum
    of all the values divided by the number of values present.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The median is another measure of central tendency. It is calculated by reporting
    the middle value of the dataset when all the values are sorted in order. Unlike
    the mean, it is not impacted by outliers. This makes it a more robust measure
    for skewed distributions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion
    in a set of values. It is calculated using the differences between each data point
    and the mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the values in the dataset
    tend to be close to the mean while a larger standard deviation indicates that
    the values are more spread out.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Percentiles indicate the relative standing of a value within a dataset when
    all of the data is sorted in order. For example, the 25th percentile is the value
    below which 25% of the data lies. The median is technically defined as the 50th
    percentile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Percentiles are calculated using the NumPy library and the specific percentiles
    of interest must be included in the function. In the example, the 25th, 50th,
    and 75th percentiles are calculated, but any percentile value from 0 to 100 is
    valid.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The correlation between two variables describes the strength and direction of
    their relationship. It is the extent to which one variable is changed when the
    other one changes. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1 where -1 indicates
    a perfect negative correlation, 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, and
    0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Covariance is a statistical measure that represents the extent to which two
    variables change together. It does not provide the strength of the relationship
    in the same way a correlation does, but does give the direction of the relationship
    between the variables. It is also key to many statistical methods that look at
    the relationships between variables, such as principal component analysis.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution of a continuous variable.
    Zero skewness indicates that the data is symmetrically distributed, such as the
    normal distribution. Skewness helps in identifying potential outliers in the dataset
    and establishing symmetry is a requirement for some statistical methods and transformations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often used in tandem with skewness, kurtosis describes how much area is in a
    distribution’s tails relative to the normal distribution. It is used to indicate
    the presence of outliers and describe the overall shape of the distribution, such
    as being highly peaked (called leptokurtic) or more flat (called platykurtic).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant
    difference between the means of two groups. Or, in the case of a one-sample t-test,
    it can be used to determine if the mean of a sample is significantly different
    from a predetermined population mean.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This test is run using the stats module within the SciPy library. The test provides
    two pieces of output, the t-statistic and the p-value. Generally, if the p-value
    is less than 0.05, the result is considered statistically significant where the
    two means are different from each other.

    between two categorical variables, such as job title and gender. The test also
    uses the stats module within the SciPy library and requires the input of both
    the observed data and the expected data. Similarly to the t-test, the output gives
    both a Chi-Squared test statistic and a p-value that can be compared to 0.05\.
