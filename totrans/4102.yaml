- en: You automate. I automate. We all automate. We automate our finances, our to-do
    lists, and our social lives. Why then, is there still so much resistance to automating
    our professional lives? I’ve been a software engineer for over a decade, and I’ve
    been an automation advocate for just as long. I’ve seen the benefits of automation
    firsthand and have helped companies adopt it. In this blog post, I’ll share 10
    small tasks that you can automate with Python.

- en: Whether you are writing software, writing business logic, or simply taking notes,
    automation is your friend. The software world has been fighting an “artificial
    intelligence arms race” with our competitors for a long time now. Even Google
    is working on autonomous robots. How can we, as developers, compete? By focusing
    on our own strengths. We can do this by applying the same techniques that we use
    for product development to software development. We can apply advanced techniques
    to our problem-solving and then automate collecting information to be used in
    those solutions. I personally find that the greater the depth of the problem I
    solve, the easier it is for me to become a master at the solution and to then
    specialize in the parts of the problem I find most interesting.

    of detail for each task. But it should give you a solid starting point. If you’re
    new to automation, I recommend checking out the [Robot Academy](https://medium.com/robotacademy) archive

    this can be expanded quite a bit and should be enough to get you started. I went
    a little overboard with this one.
