- en: Most of the people I know can build, validate, and deploy machine learning models,
    but they don’t know the basics of Python language. Their primary focus is on model
    architects instead of learning production-ready coding practices. These software
    engineering practices are necessary that will make you productive.

- en: Machine learning is all about experiments and iterations of building better
    solutions. If you can streamline this process by learning unit testing, debugging,
    logging, linting, documenting, and multi-thread processing, you can improve your
    data workflow. These practices have become the industrial standard for data science
    solutions that provide faster and more reliable development and development processes.
