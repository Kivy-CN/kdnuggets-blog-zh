    by the plethora of MOOCs available. Here, I try to give a comprehensive survey
    of such courses available freely on the internet. You can take this post as an
    complementary to [this](/2015/11/seven-steps-machine-learning-python.html) and
    [this](/2015/10/learning-machine-learning-quora.html) previous posts. I will try
    to highlight some important pointers such as the difficulty of the courses, the
    correct order in which these should to be completed, the right audience for these
    courses. You will get a feel of how these courses give you a stack of skills in
    your arsenal and how you can use them to develop practical machine learning systems.

    self contained assignments. Do you want to use MATLAB or code in Python, do you
    want to use Theano or Torch or may be Caffe? Oh, wait! May be Tensorflow? How
    do you choose which packages to dive into?

    you can't keep up with the course because you are having a difficult time understanding
    what a pseudo inverse is? That's where you have to get the basics right before
    watching these Machine Learning videos!

    - Andrew Ng, Stanford University**'

- en: This course is the starting point. Almost every machine learning engineer or
    researcher has completed this course and as a matter of fact this MOOC has the
    most largest enrolment worldwide since its first offering. Ng’s course provides
    us with a good intuition based learning. He bypasses complicated mathematical
    derivations and formulas but at the same time make them simple enough for you
    to grasp the concept. He gives a prime focus on how to use the algorithms in real
    world scenarios i.e he gives a LOT of practical advice throughout the course so
    that one can apply the material with care. One thing I liked the most about Ng
    is that he points out the mistakes which engineers make in industries and how
    you can avoid that in the first place. There is a good tutorial on Linear Algebra
    and Octave/MATLAB within the course for newbies. The assignments cover the theory
    good enough and the implementation is pretty much straightforward.

- en: That said, Ng’s course skips a lot of high level machine learning problems and
    algorithms. If you want to do some serious research then this course alone won’t
    suffice. Also, this course does not give much importance to Bayesian and probabilistic
    approach to Machine Learning as it is out of scope and somewhat advanced as per
    the goals of this course. The assignments are based on MATLAB/Octave which is
    good for research and initial understanding of the concepts but one might want
    to use Python or C for building Machine Learning Systems.

- en: I found this course on Youtube by another excellent Machine Learning researcher
    [Nando de Freitas](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/). Remember I told that Ng has
    skipped over some concepts, don’t worry this course comes to the rescue! Nando
    has done a great job by putting up these lectures. Treat them as a complementary
    to Ng’s course. Nando also gives all the prerequisites required like probability,
    maximum and log likelihood to get hold of some of the advanced concepts. You will
    get a solid background in Machine Learning after you watch all of the videos.
    He has given importance to mathematics something which Ng has skipped. He also
    uses vectorization throughout the course. By the way, skipping mathematical details
    completely can be very dangerous.

    There are multiple offerings of this course. You can do any one of them. The material
    and assignments are succinct. The concepts are lucidly explained and to the point.
    The prerequisites such as linear algebra, probability theory has been covered
    in the initial lectures. He then covers the basic tools of Machine Learning which
    is then followed by a some lectures on probabilistic graphical models. Next part
    of the course deals with AI, neural networks, active learning and reinforcement
    learning. There are two bonus guest lectures by   Dr. Burr Settles and Prof. Ziv
    Bar-Joseph. So, you see Math, ML, AI, Neural Networks Deep Learning; everything
    possible has been covered in this high level course. I would recommend doing this
    course after you finish Ng’s course in case you don’t want to browse through other
    courses. Go through all the lectures, recitations, reading material, assignments,
    projects and even his book!

    Abu divides his lectures into two categories namely: theory and practical applications.
    Conceptual understanding is his golden rule. A very smooth flow with clear explanation
    makes it yet another excellent course. The assignments are probably one of the
    best you will find on the internet. A very well respected professor. [Here](https://www.class-central.com/report/review-caltech-learning-from-data-intro-machine-learning/)

    Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning and tons of
    data science courses. Each of these courses has something different to offer.
    They focus on projects and give you all the necessary tools to do so thereby making
    you industry ready. Open source is their mantra. Explore for yourself once you
    have a good grasp of Machine Learning from the above mentioned courses. To land
    up with a job one should definitely get their hands on these MOOCs as they cover
    a variety applications of Machine Learning!

    and all the essential concepts. He gives examples from applications such as Speech
    Recognition, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing. You cannot completely
    understand  the lectures without going through all the references mentioned. But,
    if you want to see the level of difficulty of advanced machine learning and neural
    networks’ problems and what to do next this is a good starting point. Don’t get
    afraid if you cannot grasp the content. It is tough and of PhD level. By the way,
    there are guest lectures from Alex Graves and Karol Kregor working at Google DeepMind.

    and [Probability Theory](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/)
    before delving into the above courses. MIT OCW and Khan Academy provides great
    content. Try to get the intuition right. If you fail to understand some part of
    the content then better pause the video and rewatch that segment. Lastly, you
    have to become a better ML programmer and you should be able to vectorize your
    code as much as possible. You might start with many for loops but once you get
    better, code vectorization should be the case! Don’t get overwhelmed by all this
    stuff. Learn at your own pace!'
