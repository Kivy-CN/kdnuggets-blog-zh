    two months as I was challenged to interview, find, and start a new role amidst
    various challenging circumstances!

- en: I wish I had realized this a few years ago - that I do not have to do everything
    on my own and that there is nothing wrong with accepting help from those who want
    to support your goals and growth. For example, did we learn to drive or navigate
    walking by ourselves early on?!

- en: So ask your professional connections, career resources, friends, ex-colleagues,
    teammates, and more to find, explore, and connect you with new opportunities.
    Ask people all the details you are interested to learn more about! Oh, and when
    someone offers to help - accept it! If it’s unclear how they can help, ASK THEM,
    “In what areas can you help me”? It is that simple yet effective!

    and expertise and identifying the roles that sound exciting! For example, I noted
    that my background is in 3 key areas: Machine Learning + Sales + Strategy, and
    that I was looking for entrepreneurial roles. Unfortunately, there are more than
    100,000 data science roles on LinkedIn!**'

    in (Sales AND Machine Learning AND Strategy) - I could prioritize my time in reaching
    out, applying, and learning about the 100 available opportunities - a reduction
    of 99.9%! This process helped me interview and learn about 8 opportunities in
    6 weeks, so I highly recommend it!'

- en: During my first few years in the US, I used to be scared and careful to ask
    potential employers questions about H1b or immigration-related topics (as I was
    worried about being seen as not a good fit!).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, over the years, I have realized that by asking questions ahead of time
    and getting clear on what is possible and not, a lot of the hassles an employer
    has to go through, to begin with, can be eliminated. It not only helps them from
    investing time and resources in a candidate they might not be able to support
    long term, but it also helps direct you to better opportunities that will understand
    immigration circumstances and genuinely support you in the best way possible long
    term!

- en: Due to all the immigration challenges, I needed to focus and prioritize the
    task at hand - whether it be connecting with professionals, interview preparation,
    or learning about new roles. So any time or day I spent watching that latest company
    reorganization or notification about the most recent chat GPT release was not
    very helpful (unless chat GPT was going to interview for you!).
  prefs: []

- en: Personally, what has worked for me over the last few years, and especially in
    the previous two months, is the following - I do not have any notifications set
    up for emails or news websites or have 100+ newsletters that I have signed up
    for - set up time and intention for each day, focus on the task, and make incremental
    progress towards what truly matters!
