- en: If data is the world’s most valuable resource, then data science is its most
    impactful process. As more organizations realize they need data science to retain
    a competitive edge, the practice becomes increasingly crucial across industries.
    That rapid growth is largely beneficial, but it can introduce some challenges.

- en: Data volumes and processing demands are skyrocketing faster than conventional
    workflows can keep up. Data science teams need better ways to manage these rising
    needs, and cloud computing offers an ideal solution. Here are five reasons why.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud computing’s cost efficiency is among its greatest strengths. Implementing
    and maintaining on-premise servers [can be highly expensive](/2023/05/efficiently-scale-data-science-projects-cloud-computing.html)
    upfront and requires significant ongoing labor and IT costs. Storing and processing
    data on the cloud eliminates many of those expenses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the cloud model, you don’t have to buy or maintain your own equipment. Considering
    how much processing power modern data science can require, that can represent
    massive savings. You also only pay for the resources you use, so any rising costs
    you acquire as you grow reflect actual data volume growth with no surplus.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cloud can also streamline data science workflows. Software-as-a-service
    (SaaS) solutions give you access to computing speeds and capacity you may be unable
    to afford otherwise. Consequently, you can run more complex calculations with
    fewer processing delays.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud systems also consolidate once-separate databases and workloads. That consolidation
    eliminates wasted time from switching between apps and reduces the risk of data
    entry and transfer errors. Bad data [can significantly hinder operational efficiency](/2020/03/bad-data-affecting-organizations-operational-efficiency.html),
    so this reliability further improves productivity.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite common misgivings about cloud cybersecurity, cloud computing has several
    security advantages. The vast majority of cloud breaches [come from human error](https://www.mip.com/blog/is-accounting-data-security-reliable-on-the-cloud/),
    not technical shortcomings in the cloud itself. However, the SaaS model can make
    high security more accessible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cloud providers often have advanced security features data scientists may be
    unable to afford or implement in-house. That could include autonomous monitoring,
    automated compliance, and extensive encrypted backups. Segmenting networks is
    also easier in the cloud, making zero-trust and similar security architectures
    more accessible.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the cloud also lets you store and process more data than you may be able
    to with an on-prem solution. Data science applications are often most effective
    when you have more information, but managing large data volumes on in-house systems
    can quickly become expensive and inefficient.

- en: Global data volumes are [on track to exceed 180 zettabytes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/)
    by 2025\. That can make data science more reliable than ever, but only if you
    have the storage capacity and computing strength to support it. The cloud makes
    that level of storage and analysis possible when it’d be prohibitively expensive
    in-house.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, the cloud is far more scalable than conventional data science workflows.
    Expanding your capacity the traditional way means buying and setting up additional
    servers, which is expensive and can disrupt current workflows. With the cloud,
    all you have to do is pay a higher rate for more capacity, and you’ll gain it
    immediately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That fast scalability is critical given digital data’s current growth rate.
    However, if you need to downsize your operations, downscaling in the cloud is
    still more cost-effective than conventional means. As your capacity falls, so
    will your rates, ensuring downsizing doesn’t leave you with wasted hardware you’re
    not using.

    considerable workloads. As those demands rise, conventional, on-premise setups
    quickly become insufficient.

    scalability data science teams need. Capitalizing on this opportunity will help
    you maximize returns from your data science applications.
