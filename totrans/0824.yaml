    awareness and interest among consumers leading to more purchases. Targeted advertisements
    or campaigns are launched to reach a broader audience in order to acquire new
    customers for their products. Advertisements are broadcasted through multiple
    media, it can be broadcasted on television, radio, magazines, online, through
    social media, and even in stores to reach a wide audience. Due to the abundance
    of options and the imperative to maximize return on investment (ROI), efficient
    allocation of advertising resources presents a significant challenge. This is
    where media mix modeling becomes paramount for businesses to optimize their advertisement
    spending and maximize their RoI. By estimating how much money should be spent
    on certain media channels to achieve specific goals (such as increased sales or
    brand awareness), media mix modeling is a useful tool for businesses. This allows
    them to compare various channels' performance and identify where there are opportunities
    for improvement, and spend resources sensibly. Data-driven insights allow businesses
    to fine-tune their marketing approaches, increase the value of their spending,
    and accelerate the process of reaching their business objectives. Media mix modeling
    is a statistical analysis technique where one analyzes historical advertisement
    data including spend, ad impressions or clicks delivered, product sales, new customers
    acquired, etc. in order to understand the impact of different media channels on
    business outcomes. This allows businesses to perform their advertisement budget
    portfolio optimization and increase their RoI.

    account external factors such as if the business ran any promotions, holidays,
    or any special event which might have impacted the sales. This is done in order
    to avoid any form of overestimation of the impact of the media channels' performance.

    into their media mix models is Seasonality.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, we can define seasonality as a characteristic of time series
    data in which we can observe predictable and regular behavior that gets repeated
    annually. Thus, we can say that any behavioral fluctuation that is predictable
    and recurs every year is a seasonal behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, how does seasonality differ from cyclical effect? Cyclical effects are
    the ones that can span over varying time periods. They may last longer or shorter
    than one year such as boosted sales of water filtration devices in a region due
    to some fault that might have occurred in the water pipeline. This kind of effect
    isn’t regular or predictable and might not repeat every year. Whereas, a boost
    in sales of flu medications due to flu season can be characterized as seasonal
    since it repeats every year from December to February and can be predicted.

- en: But why is seasonality important for media advertising? Seasonality primarily
    affects media mix modeling in two ways. Firstly, a change in media consumption
    patterns, and secondly a shift in advertising effectiveness is observed. As we
    discussed above how media mix modeling can help marketers understand the impact
    of various media channels on their sales or other key performance indicators such
    as new customer acquisitions. The incorporation of seasonality into these models
    enables advertisers to more accurately reflect the shifts in advertising performance
    that occur throughout the year. For instance, during the holiday seasons, various
    media channels may observe increased viewership or higher engagement, which makes
    them more successful in reaching their respective target audiences. Advertisers
    are able to maximize the effectiveness of their media allocation plans when they
    acknowledge and take into account seasonality. They are able to modify their advertising
    budgets, campaigns, and channel selection in order to align themselves with seasonal
    trends and the demand of consumers. This guarantees that marketing efforts are
    concentrated during times when they are most likely to generate maximum impact,
    hence optimizing the return on advertising investments.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can incorporate seasonality into media mix models by using seasonal factors
    or dummy variables to represent specific seasonal events such as holidays. These
    factors capture the influence of different time periods on media response and
    help adjust the model's predictions accordingly. These variables capture the impact
    of different time periods on media response and aid in the model's prediction.

    that can help generate seasonality variables for us. The library splits a time
    series into three components namely, trend, seasonality, and the residuals. Seasonality
    can be represented by two kinds of models, either additive or multiplicative.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For simplicity, let us assume we are dealing with an additive model. An additive
    model can be used when the variance of the time series doesn't change over different
    values of the time series. Mathematically we can represent an additive model as
    follows where the individual components of trend, seasonality, and residual are
    added together.

- en: The trend component describes the change in the time series that occurs over
    a longer period of time and is more systematic. It reflects the fundamental increase
    or decrease in the series and provides an indication of the overall trend as well
    as the magnitude of the data collected over a prolonged time period. It is helpful
    in determining the underlying pattern of the data as well as the directionality
    of the data. In Figure 1, we have the seasonality decomposition of revenue over
    8 months, and if we look at the trend we observe that there is a decline in revenue
    during the summer months of the year. This insight can be crucial for advertisers
    as they can devise a change in strategy or their spending pattern.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The seasonality factor refers to recurrent patterns that take place over shorter
    periods of time, often within the span of one year. It is a representation of
    the frequent oscillations that occur as a result of external influences such as
    the weather, holidays, or other cultural events. The recurrent peaks and valleys
    that are characteristic of seasonality are a reflection of the regularities that
    can be anticipated within the data. In Figure 1 above we can see that there are
    peaks every alternate month which can help guide businesses to identify some external
    influences having an impact on revenue.

    or seasonality are represented by the residual component, which is also known
    as the error or noise component. It takes into account any fluctuations or anomalies
    that are still present after the trend and seasonality components have been taken
    into consideration. The fraction of the data that is unpredictable and lacks a
    systematic pattern is denoted by the residual component.

- en: Finally, we saw how seasonality influences media mix modeling and drives strategic
    business decisions. Marketers can optimize their advertising tactics and budget
    allocation based on swings in consumer behavior and market dynamics throughout
    the year by including seasonality in media mix models. Understanding seasonal
    patterns allows firms to target the correct demographic, choose the best media
    channels, and time their advertising campaigns for maximum impact. Companies may
    improve the efficiency and efficacy of their advertising activities, increase
    customer engagement, generate sales, and ultimately improve their return on investments
    by employing seasonality analysis information. Seasonality enables firms to adjust
    and tailor their marketing tactics to correspond with shifting consumer demands
    and preferences, giving them a competitive advantage in a volatile environment.
