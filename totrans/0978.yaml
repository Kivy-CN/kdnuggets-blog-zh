- en: Could you consider **data lakehouse** a new buzzword in the world of tech? It
    seems as though we could. We first started off with using data warehouses, which
    refer to an information storage architecture that can be analyzed to help in the
    decision-making process.

    aspects of the world of business. However, the era of Big Data soon came around
    the corner, when unstructured raw data made up nearly 80-90% of available data
    and information in many organizations.

    was unable to handle unstructured data and its model is based on being structured.

    an organization which offers "a lakehouse platform for teams that know and love
    SQL." Dremio was founded in 2015, and solely specialized in data lakehouses. They
    have worked with bringing their technology to a variety of organizations including
    Unilever, Deloitte, Nokia, and have different cloud and technology partners such
    as AWS. Dremio has gone on to become a leader in the data lakehouse space.

    exploration to mission-critical business intelligence dashboards on a single copy
    of data (typically [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format which
    is the most performant) as it lives in cloud object storage.

    lakehouses enable SQL engines (Dremio, Hive, Athena, Spark SQL, etc.) to provide
    [Data Manipulation Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language)
    (DML) functions on industry-standard table formats with database level guarantees
    for transactions and data consistency.

    but the story goes even further when you look at the differences. Data lakehouses
    support other engines for use cases beyond SQL such as machine learning or streaming
    on the same data. They are also vendor agnostic, which means that they are and
    all of the data used is kept in open formats adhering to the open data architecture
    philosophy.

    to analyze data immediately - this is the big plus! Data engineers save a lot
    of time and money required to load data into a warehouse for others to use as
    well as maintaining the associated infrastructure.

    data warehouses are notorious for. Data in cloud object storage is stored in open,
    vendor-agnostic formats like [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) and
    [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/), so no vendor has leverage over
    the data.
