- en: The rise of smart devices, new and ever more complex streams of information,
    and the proliferation of more and more tools to catalog, process, and interpret
    all of it has brought us to a place where “keeping up” is in some cases the best
    we can hope for. Technology suffers from a problem of inheritance, and thus as
    we innovate, we tend to introduce more complexity than potentially necessary.
    As systems evolve, those of us who help to design them are constantly weighing
    options against the “necessity” of technical debt. It may help to understand what
    options we have going forward by first briefly going back to know the limitations
    and forces that shaped where we stand now.

- en: For the first roughly 30 years in the evolution of Data the world was structured,
    relational databases were the norm, and there was a limited set of languages an
    engineer had to know in order to derive a result (mostly dominated by SQL). The
    tools needed to interact with databases were efficient and could count on mostly
    clean data. Reports generated in the form of dashboards were relatively easy to
    interpret, and for their part provided meaningful measures upon which to base
    decisions. These results became even more insightful with the rise of Statistical
    Analysis and Data Mining in the 1990s.

    new kind of data: Unstructured. The previous systems of structured content, with
    their mature analysis tools, and by comparison, easy to understand and clearly
    defined data types were still present. But unstructured data required a new way
    of doing things, and also opened new opportunities for insights to those who knew
    how to use it. Web use created a constant stream of media uploaded to social media
    sites. We saw the beginnings of a network of sensors and smart devices (that would
    come to be known as the Internet of Things), all generating more and more data
    by the day. A new way of processing and understanding all of it was required.
    Old systems and tools evolved into new ones to keep up, and those who could wield
    them became what we now know as Data Scientists. We also saw the beginnings of
    long-term storage moving from physical servers and data warehouses to cloud storage,
    leading to our industry’s evolution from data center focused to being increasingly
    diversified among various Cloud solutions and services.'

    as mobile devices became more and more commonplace. With their adoption we saw
    the addition of storage for geo-spatial data, and behavioral data from devices
    to the mix of unstructured data. Further a growing adoption of “smart devices”
    only accelerated the creation of, and necessity for storage of more and more data.

- en: For many senior leaders who deal with technology infrastructure and/or services,
    a detailed view of how their systems are structured would run dozens of pages
    long and include dependencies among multiple vendors and service providers. It
    would also (in most cases) include separate procedures and processes for dealing
    with each separate class of data they deal with and have to take into account
    any regulations and laws that have bearing on that data. Further, these procedures
    require specialists in each step of the operational chain. Whether it’s analysts
    and data scientists scrubbing data for hygiene to derive valuable insights from
    the data on hand, or engineers working on integrating disparate systems so they
    can speak to each other, each role both contributes to and is constrained by the
    overall system they work within.

- en: This system as it has evolved leads inherently to 3 major problems. First, data
    has a tendency to sit idle unless it is explicitly needed by someone or something.
    Second, in order to manage these idle data sets, a company must hire more people
    to meet the demands their system is generating. Be it analysts and data scientists,
    or engineers to design *new* systems to automate the processes they are currently
    fulfilling with people. Adding new systems to a workflow leads to the need to
    design secondary systems for the output of those automated processes to be re-introduced
    to the current data flow. And third, accept that both of the first two issues
    will only continue to grow at a compounded rate as long as their data sources
    continue to output more and more new pieces of information.

    an “ideal” solution for the majority of large data creators and consumers?

    it look like for a modern enterprise and what advantages would they now have?
    First, and foremost, they would have the flexibility to re-align their work groups
    into areas of the business where human creativity and input can bring greater
    value. This may lead to exploring new lines of business or services which would
    have been cost prohibitive previously, or simply impossible to execute given the
    constraints of the previous system. Further, a re-imagining of our approach to
    unstructured data may uncover brand new use cases for the data we already possess
    with which we are currently doing nothing.
