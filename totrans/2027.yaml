- en: You have probably read an article about the difference between a data scientist
    and a data engineer. I always thought the distinction was clear. Data engineers
    make the data ready for use, and then data scientists work on that data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, my opinion on this distinction has changed dramatically after I started
    working as a data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everything in data science starts with data. Your machine learning model is
    just as good as the data fed into it. Garbage in, garbage out! A data scientist
    cannot do some magic to create a valuable product without proper data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The proper data is not always readily available for data scientists. In most
    cases, it will be the responsibility of the data scientist to convert the raw
    data to a proper format.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unless you work for a big tech company that has separate teams of data engineers
    and data scientists, you should possess the ability and skills to handle some
    data engineering tasks. These tasks cover a broad range of operations, and I will
    elaborate on this in the remaining part of the article.
  prefs: []

    engineer and a data scientist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data engineer is a data engineer. A data scientist should be both a data scientist
    and a data engineer.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It may seem like an arguable statement. However, I would like to emphasize that
    my opinion was different before I started working as a data scientist. I used
    to think of data engineers and data scientists as separate entities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the remaining part of the article, I will try to explain what I mean by a
    data scientist should be both a data scientist and a data engineer.
  prefs: []

- en: For instance, data engineers do a set of operations known as ETL (extract, transform,
    load). It covers the procedures for collecting data from one or more sources,
    applying some transformations, and then loading it into a different source.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would definitely not be surprised if a data scientist is expected to perform
    ETL operations. Data science is still evolving, and most companies do not have
    clearly separated data engineer and data scientist roles. As a result, a data
    scientist should be able to perform some data engineering tasks.
  prefs: []

- en: If you expect to only work on running machine learning algorithms with ready-to-use
    data, you will face the harsh truth soon after you start working as a data scientist.
  prefs: []

- en: You may have to write some stored procedures in SQL to preprocess the client
    data. It is also possible that you receive the client data from a few different
    sources. It will be your job to extract and combine them. Then, you will need
    to load them into a single source. In order to write efficient stored procedures,
    you need extensive SQL skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The transforming part of ETL procedures involves many data cleaning and manipulation
    steps. SQL may not be the best choice if you work with large-scale data. Distributed
    computing is a better alternative in such cases. Therefore, a data scientist should
    also be familiar with distributed computing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your best friend in distributed computing might be Spark. It is an analytics
    engine used for large-scale data processing. We can distribute both data and computations
    over clusters to achieve a substantial performance increase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are familiar with Python and SQL, you won’t have a hard time getting
    used to Spark. You can use Spark features with PySpark, which is a Python API
    for Spark.

- en: When it comes to working with clusters, the optimal environment is the cloud.
    There are various cloud providers, but AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
    lead the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the PySpark code is the same for all cloud providers, how you set up
    the environment and create clusters change between them. They allow for creating
    clusters using both scripts or the user interface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Distributed computing over clusters is a whole different world. It is nothing
    like doing analysis on your computer. It has very different dynamics. Evaluating
    cluster performance and choosing the optimal number of workers for a cluster will
    be your predominant concerns.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Long story short, data processing will be a substantial part of your job as
    a data scientist. By substantial, I mean more than 80% of your time. Data processing
    is not just cleaning and manipulating the data. It also involves ETL operations
    which are thought to be the job of a data engineer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I strongly recommend getting familiar with ETL tools and concepts. It would
    be of great help if you had a chance to practice them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It would be a naive assumption to think you will only work on machine learning
    algorithms as a data scientist. It is an important task too, but it will only
    consume a small part of your time.
