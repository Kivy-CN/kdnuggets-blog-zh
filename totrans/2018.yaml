    and OLAP-related concepts, such as multi-dimensional analysis, and OLAP cubes.
    That is because OLAP is a well-known and mature concept; but in this age of high-powered
    analytics, is it "yesterday's technology," or even obsolete?  That question seems
    to be on the minds of many, as a search for "OLAP is dead" returns more than 2
    million results (See Fig. 1).

- en: Before the cloud-era, when enterprise data warehouses (EDW) enjoyed wide adoption,
    OLAP databases were mandatory components in the data mart layer, such as Oracle
    Essbase and Microsoft SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Service). But when data warehouses
    moved to the cloud, and the data lake rose in prominence, OLAP became an old school
    and uncool; many even argued that OLAP–as well as other legacies, approaches like
    extract, transform, and load (ETL) and data modeling–was dead.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common way to build a data pipeline for serving data analytics is to
    generate flat tables. However, the overuse of such methods will cause a proliferation
    of flat tables. For example, one internet company in China has more than 5,700
    source tables in its data lake, but that number explodes to nearly one million
    flat tables and aggregated tables after a long period of use in data analytics,
    forcing the data team to actively govern and manage its excess of tables. They
    not only face the challenge of managing data quality and consistency but also
    controlling the ever-growing operating cost resulting from the proliferating data.
    What’s worse, each flat table generated by at least one ETL job and the script
    takes extra effort to maintain, and extra computing resources to run.

- en: How many computation and storage resources must be invested for each source
    table? And how much usage is required for each flat table? It is difficult to
    know, and so costs are not only high but unpredictable. And once a flat table
    is generated, it's difficult for it to be reused by others since the processing
    logic is not easy to understand. The problem is exacerbated by problematic lifecycle
    management. As a result, flat tables and ETL jobs become technical debts.

- en: Business intelligence (BI) dashboards are regarded as requisite deliverables
    from data engineers and analysts to business users. Even in smaller organizations,
    it is common to see lots of BI dashboards and reports in use. The core value of
    data is the metrics generated by the dashboards, but too many dashboards can be
    confusing and costly. It is more efficient to use fewer dashboards to maintain
    a consistent user experience, lower costs, and still provide the necessary tools
    for users across the organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One Chinese financial services firm built a metrics store to maintain nearly
    10,000 metrics in total while reducing the number of dashboards curated and generated
    by data engineers and analysts. This not only saves cost and makes it easier for
    both users and data teams, but a proliferation of BI dashboards will lead to data
    silos and business misalignment, having a detrimental effect on processes and
    results. Once again, the effect is more technical debt.

    end-to-end data pipeline is complete and business users can begin operationalizing
    their data. There are no ETLs or flat tables that need to be created and managed
    for data aggregation. Precomputation results will use fewer storage resources
    and be a better alternative to flat tables, and they will be governed under the
    umbrella of data models. And precomputation results can be managed flexibly according
    to the query patterns, reducing the debts normally caused by flat tables.
