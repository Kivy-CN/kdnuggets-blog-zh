    and understand the whole book in 5 minutes, or you can even use it to understand
    highly technical legal contracts. Just like ChatGPT, you can ask questions from
    the books, and it will help you learn a certain concept or story.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After uploading the PDF file, ChatPDF analyzes the PDF file by creating a semantic
    index and sharing relevant paragraphs with a text-generation AI. After that, you
    can use it to extract information from files. ChatPDF works smoothly with large
    files like manuals, legal contracts, books, and research papers.

    past self. By accessing **chatpdf.com**, you will see the front page explaining
    where it can be used and 3 options to add the PDF file. You can directly provide
    the link, upload the file, or search for the PDF.

    in the book. The answer is good but not as good as ChatGPT. Maybe code blocks
    are missing.

- en: By creating the account, you can view your previous chat session, but there
    are limitations, and if you are used to the free ChatGPT experience, you will
    get annoyed by 3 PDFs per day and 50 questions. You can overcome your frustration
    by buying a Plus membership.

    There were many occasions when ChatPDF failed to understand the context and gave
    wrong interpretations. Other limitations are related to technical content like
    code blocks, tables, etc. You can still ask the bot to write Python code, and
    it will display the code, but it is not that great compared to ChatGPT.
