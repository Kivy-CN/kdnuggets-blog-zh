    of the very basic data science skills and languages that you'll need to pursue
    data science as a hobby or a career. Tutorials, lessons, and videos are all great,
    but projects really act as a stepping stone to getting involved with data science
    and getting your hands dirty.
  prefs: []

- en: Data science projects for beginners are better for learning languages and skills
    because they're stickier. I can watch a video about learning Python 10,000 times,
    but I only really start to understand Python when I take a project and do it myself.
    Data science projects are great because you’ve got much more personal vested interest
    than just watching an online tutorial. You’re motivated to see something through
    when you have a stake in the matter.
