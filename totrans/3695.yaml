    After OpenAI launched [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps) as a close source
    model, EleutherAI launched an open-source alternative called GPT-Neo that has
    provided comparative results. Similarly, when [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2)
    was launched an open-source version of DALL·E 2 was released by Stability AI called
    [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release).

    are craving to get an open-source version of the model and build their applications
    safely with more control. Currently, ChatGPT is offering API access and the ability
    to fine-tune, but you will be using their service and machine to perform all kinds
    of tasks.

- en: On March 10, 2023, Together Computer released the open-source version of ChatGPT
    called [OpenChatKit](https://www.together.xyz/blog/openchatkit). An open-source
    alternative allows developers to have more control over the chatbot's behavior
    and tailor it to their specific needs. Moreover, it is more accessible to a wider
    range of users and communities, particularly those who may not have the resources
    to access proprietary models.

    It is based on EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX model and fine-tuned on 43 million high-quality
    conversational instructions. The developer team has particularly focused on tuning
    several tasks such as multi-turn dialogue, question answering, classification,
    extraction, and summarization.
