    or mathematical statistics (or anything else) to correctly estimate the chance
    of a very rare event?

- en: '[Extreme value theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory)
    (EVT) focuses on rare events and extremes, as opposed to classical approaches
    to statistics which concentrate on average behaviors. EVT states that there are
    [3 types of distributions needed to model the the extreme data points of a collection
    of random observations from some distribution](http://www.mathwave.com/articles/extreme-value-distributions.html):
    the Gumble, Frechet, and Weibull distributions, also known as the Extreme Value
    Distributions (EVD) 1, 2, and 3, respectively.'

- en: 'The EVT states that, if you were to generate N data sets from a given distribution,
    and then create a new dataset containing only the maximum values of these N data
    sets, this new dataset would only be accurately described by one of the EVD distributions:
    Gumbel, Frechet, or Weibull. The Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEV)
    is, then, a model combining the 3 EVT models as well as the EVD model.'

    to fit our data, and then evaluate. Once the best fitting model is found, analysis
    can be performed, including calculating possibilities.

    methods build a model based on users past behavior (items previously purchased,
    movies viewed and rated, etc) and use decisions made by current and other users.
    This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user
    may be interested in.'

    systems - Last.fm and Pandora Radio. (example from [Recommender System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system)

- en: Last.fm creates a "station" of recommended songs by observing what bands and
    individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those
    against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do
    not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar
    interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example
    of a collaborative filtering technique.

- en: Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes
    provided by the Music Genome Project) in order to seed a "station" that plays
    music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results,
    deemphasizing certain attributes when a user "dislikes" a particular song and
    emphasizing other attributes when a user "likes" a song. This is an example of
    a content-based approach.

- en: In binary classification (or medical testing), False positive is when an algorithm
    (or test) indicates presence of a condition, when in reality it is absent. A false
    negative is when an algorithm (or test) indicates absence of a condition, when
    in reality it is present.

    and false negative - type II error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is obviously very important to distinguish and treat false positives and
    false negatives differently because the costs of such errors can be hugely different.

- en: For example, if a test for serious disease is false positive (test says disease,
    but person is healthy), then an extra test will be made that will determine the
    correct diagnosis. However, if a test is false negative (test says healthy, but
    person has disease), then treatment will be done and person may die as a result.
