    get some projects under your belt. Doing data science projects helps you to develop
    the skills you’ll need to work as a data scientist. You’ll also have a product
    you can put on your resume and discuss during interviews, which is critical to
    show you know what you’re doing.

    whether it’s for a company or for your own personal project.You’ll need to be
    comfortable with data collection, cleaning, modeling, and visualization to be
    a proficient data scientist. The specific tool stack you use at your future data
    science job may vary from the tools I recommend below, but like anything in the
    computer science world, it’s more about learning how to think than specific syntax
    or features of one tool over another. After all, if you can create data visualizations
    using Tableau, you will be able to learn how to do it with Power BI fairly quickly
    since you are already familiar with the general process for visualizing data.

    would be published to the front- and back-end in order to structure the communication
    between them. REST APIs are very popular and used to query a web service for data.
