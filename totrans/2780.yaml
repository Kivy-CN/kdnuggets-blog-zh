    platforms for internal use (i.e., Facebook’s FBLearning, Uber’s Michelangelo,

    platform solutions, including those from incumbent vendors (e.g., Amazon Sagemaker,
    Microsoft Azure ML, Google Cloud ML, etc.) and the challengers in the space (e.g.,
    DataRobot, H2O, BigML, Dataiku). Incumbent vendors follow an incremental strategy
    approach, with their ML services offering sitting on top of their existing cloud
    services as another application layer vs. the ML *native *approach taken by the
