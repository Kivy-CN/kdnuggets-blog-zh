- en: '[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) is an AI-based chatbot system which
    [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) launched in November 2022\. OpenAI is known for
    creating Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system and DALLE•2, an AI image
    and art generator.'

- en: ChatGPT uses the company's GPT-3 technology. It stands for Generative Pre-trained
    Transformer 3 and is an autoregressive language model which uses deep learning
    to produce human-like text. It is a language-processing AI model, and right now
    one of the most popular.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The GPT-3 training model uses a ‘generative pretraining’ training method, meaning
    that it is trained in a way that it can predict what token is next. For this to
    happen, the model requires an initial prompt text and then it will continue to
    produce text using that initial prompt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model is optimized using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
    to achieve conversational dialogue. The model was trained using a variety of data
    which were written by people to achieve responses that sounded human-like.

- en: GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model, so it can be difficult to narrow
    down all of GPT-3’s capabilities. It is a model that focuses purely on language,
    so it has an in-depth understanding of the written and spoken word.

    of time and energy that goes into producing something worthwhile. The power of
    ChatGPT lies in its speed to produce well-written content in seconds and its ability
    to take complicated topics and simplify them.

- en: As mentioned before, OpenAI used Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
    (RLHF). They started with training an initial model using supervised fine-tuning.
    The human AI trainers played both the user and AI assistant and provided conversations
    to help build natural and engaging responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reinforcement learning uses a reward signal/system that helps the machine learning
    model improve. OpenAI collected comparison data, two or more model responses that
    were ranked by quality. OpenAI took conversations that occurred between AI trainers
    and the chatbot, randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative
    completions, and had the AI trainers rank its quality. This allowed them to use
    these reward models and fine-tune them using Proximal Policy Optimization.
