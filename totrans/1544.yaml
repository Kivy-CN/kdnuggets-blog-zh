    the game development process. The whole idea of the game, its functionality, and
    design play a critical part in keeping the player engaged and interested in playing.
    Insights gained from gaming data are very much appreciated in this case. A game
    should be regarded as a kind mechanism which performance may be measured, and
    as a result, it may be tuned according to the need of a customer. Data science
    is utilized to build models, to analyze and identify optimization points, make
    predictions and empower machine learning algorithms, identify patterns and trends
    to guide service maps and improve gaming models.
