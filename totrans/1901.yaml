    smoothness in order to prevent [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).

    vector. This constant is often either the [L1 (Lasso)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics))
    or [L2 (ridge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization), but can
    in actuality can be any norm. The model predictions should then minimize the mean
    of the loss function calculated on the regularized training set.
