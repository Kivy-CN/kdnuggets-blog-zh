    just doesn’t cut it anymore. To get hired, you need to go a step above knowing
    languages, frameworks, and how to search on StackOverflow. You need far more conceptual
    understanding, and a grasp of today’s data science landscape – including things
    you think only the CEO of a company should be worried about, like data governance
    and ethics.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Previously, data scientists worked in isolation, in dark underground basements
    producing models. The models would create predictions or insights; those would
    be passed onto C-suite execs who would act on them with no understanding of the
    model that had produced these predictions. (I’m exaggerating a little, but not
    by that much.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, leadership takes a much more active role in understanding the products
    of data scientists. That means that you, as a data scientist, need to be able
    to explain why models do what they do, how they work, and why they came up with
    that particular prediction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'While you could show your boss the actual code running your model, it’s much
    more useful (read: employable) to be able to show them how your model works through
    visualization. For example, imagine you''ve developed an ML model that predicts
    customer churn for a telecom company. Instead of a screenshot of your lines of
    code, you could use a flowchart or decision tree diagram to visually explain how
    the model segments customers and identifies those at risk of churning. This makes
    the model''s logic transparent and easier to grasp.'

    There aren’t any courses yet, but I recommend you try a free tool like Miro to
    create a flowchart documenting your decision tree. Better yet, try to explain
    your code to a non-data scientist friend or family member. The more lay, the better.

- en: Many data scientists tend to focus more on model algorithms than on the nuances
    of the input data. Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying,
    and creating features (input variables) to improve the performance of machine
    learning models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you're working on a predictive model for real estate prices,
    you might start with basic features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and
    location. However, through feature engineering, you could create more nuanced
    features. You might calculate the distance to the nearest public transport station
    or create a feature that represents the age of the property. You could even combine
    existing features to create new ones, such as a "location desirability score"
    based on crime rates, school ratings, and proximity to amenities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s a rare skill because it requires not just technical know-how, but also
    deep domain knowledge and creativity. You need to really *get* your data and the
    problem at hand, and then creatively transform the data to make it more useful
    for modeling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Feature engineering is often covered as part of broader machine learning courses
    on platforms like Coursera, edX, or Udacity. But I find the best way to learn
    is through hands-on experience. Work on real-world data and experiment with different
    feature engineering strategies.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you answered, “grappling with ETL pipelines,” you’re wrong. Your biggest
    challenge is likely to be making sure your model is not only effective but also
    compliant, ethical, and sustainable. That includes ensuring that any data you
    collect for the model complies with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR, depending
    on your location. You need to know when it’s even legal to use that data, how
    you need to anonymize it, what consent you require from patients, and how to get
    that consent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you need to be able to document data sources, transformations, and model
    decisions so that a non-expert would be able to audit the model. This traceability
    is vital not just for regulatory compliance but also for future model audits and
    improvements.

    ensure that any model you create doesn't inadvertently introduce biases that could
    lead to unequal treatment of certain groups.

- en: I love the example of [Amazon’s old recruitment model](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G)
    to illustrate why ethics matter. If you’re not familiar with it, Amazon data scientists
    tried to speed up their hiring workflow by creating a model that could pick out
    potential hires based on resumes. The problem was that they trained the model
    on their existing base of resumes, which was very male-dominated. Their new model
    was biased towards male hires. That is extremely unethical.

- en: We are so far past the “move fast and break things” stage of data science. Now,
    as a data scientist, you need to know that your decisions will have a real impact
    on people. Ignorance is no longer an excuse; you need to be fully aware of all
    the possible ramifications your model could have, and why it makes the decisions
    it makes.

- en: One secret life hack is that the better you know how to market, the easier you’ll
    find it to get a job. And by “market,” I mean “know how to make things sexy.”
    With the ability to market, you’ll be better at making a resume that sells your
    skills. You’ll be better at charming an interviewer. And in data science specifically,
    you’ll be better at explaining why your model – and the results of your model
    – matter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember, it doesn’t matter how good your model is if you can’t convince anyone
    else it’s necessary. For example, imagine you've developed a model that can predict
    equipment failures in a manufacturing plant. In theory, your model could save
    the company millions in unplanned downtime. But if you can't communicate that
    fact to the C-suite, your model will languish unused on your computer.

    a compelling presentation that highlights the financial benefits, the potential
    for increased productivity, and the long-term advantages of adopting your model.

    are numbers people at heart. Most would-be data scientists really believe that
    simply doing your best and keeping your head down is a winning employment strategy.
    Unfortunately, computers are not the ones hiring you – people are. Being able
    to market yourself, your skills, and your products is a real advantage in today’s
    job market.

    “Marketing in a Digital World,” offered by Coursera. I especially liked the section
    on “Offering product ideas that stick in a digital world.” There aren’t any data
    science-specific marketing courses out there, but I liked [this blog post](https://www.edlitera.com/blog/posts/most-important-skill-data-science)
    that walks through how to market yourself as a data scientist.
