    a quick and dirty ad-hoc query or a super sophisticated statistical model, at
    the end of the day, we're informing a decision.

    before starting a data project. We assume it''s baked into everything we do, so
    when the product team asks a question like: "Which products are commonly purchased
    together?" it''s natural to jump straight into figuring out what data we need,
    which approach is best, etc, etc. It''s a straightforward ask, and the data work
    could be fun. How should we visualize the results? What if the patterns have changed
    over time? We dive right into the data without taking the time to really (I mean
    really) understand the decision we''re trying to inform.'

    specific but aren''t. "I need to segment our customers so that I can personalize
    their emails." What does that mean? How will they personalize the email? We might
    learn that the email team just wants to update the subject lines to improve open
    rates. That information can change the entire analysis.'

- en: '**"I''ll know what to do once I see the data."** This is usually a sign that
    there''s no plan for action. These responses usually lead to the ever-so-common
    situation where an analysis is interesting but not actionable.If you hear a response
    like this one, I recommend playing out a few hypotheticals with your colleague:
    "What will you do if the data says X? What if it says Y?" I love this exercise
    because it allows you both to peek into the future where you have the answers,
    but still don''t know what to do about it. Most people have a tendency to romanticize
    what the data can do for them, which is why it can be disappointing when you get
    the analysis, but it doesn''t solve any of your problems. The game of hypotheticals
    helps bring everyone back to reality and be practical about what can be accomplished
    with the data.'

    More questions are great, as long as they eventually lead to an action. Endless
    questions just lead to more learning, and learning is cool, but it''s not what
    runs a company--decisions do. For responses like this, follow the question trail
    to see if you can eventually get to an action: "What do you plan to do once you
    answer the follow-up question?"'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**"I don''t know."** A skilled data analyst can usually spot a data question
    that''s not going to be actionable, but it can be difficult to help someone else
    see it the same way. Asking the stakeholder how the data will change their decision
    is a great way to help them see that their data question won''t give them the
    results they''re looking for. Ask the magic question often enough, and you''re
    bound to get a few "I don''t know’s.” When this happens, it''s a great opportunity
    to reset. It''s so much easier to start with a decision and figure out the data
    you''ll need to inform it than the other way around.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next time someone comes to you with a data request, remember the magic question.
    And remember, a bad response doesn't mean game over. It should be a starting point
    to get you to the final, better data question. A skilled data analyst will always
    tease out the real problem and understand the real decision before starting any
    project. This makes the difference between a data project that is just "interesting"
    and a data project that drives an impact.
