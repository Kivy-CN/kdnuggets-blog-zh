    For starters, game environments are becoming a popular training mechanism in areas
    such as reinforcement learning or imitation learning. In theory, any multi-agent
    AI system can be subjected to gamified interactions between its participants.
    The branch of mathematics that formulates the principles of games is known as
    game theory. In the context of artificial intelligence(AI) and deep learning systems,
    game theory is essential to enable some of the key capabilities required in multi-agent
    environments in which different AI programs need to interact or compete in order
    to accomplish a goal.

    of the current research in game theory dates back to the work of computer science
    pioneers like [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) or [John
    Von Neuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann)n. The famous Nash
    equilibrium popularized by the movie [“A Beautiful Mind”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)) is
    the cornerstone of many AI interactions in modern systems. However, modeling an
    AI universe using the principles of game theory many times goes beyond the Nash
    equilibrium. A good place to start understanding the implications architecting
    AI systems using principles of game theory is to understand the different types
    of games that we typically encountered in our social or economic interactions.

    dynamics. However, the architecture of those gamified environments are completely
    different and so are the incentives and goals of the participant. How to apply
    some of principles to the modeling of AI agents? That’s a challenge that is pushing
    entire segments of AI research such as multi-agent reinforcement learning.

    is far from being the only space on which those concepts are applied. From that
    perspective, there are many other areas that can be influenced by the combination
    of game theory and AI. The fact us that most scenarios that involve multiple “participants”
    collaborating or competing to accomplish a task can be gamified and improved using
    AI techniques. Even though the previous statement is a generalization, I hope
    it conveys the point that game theory and AI is a way to think and model software
    systems rather than a specific technique.

    symmetric game describes an environment in which each player has the same goals
    and the results will only depend on the strategies involved. Chess is a classic
    example of a symmetric game. Many of the situations we encountered in the real
    world lack the mathematical elegance of symmetry as participants often have different
    and even conflicting goals. A business negotiation is an example of asymmetric
    game in which each party has different goals and evaluates the results from a
    different perspective (ex: winning a contract vs. minimizing an investment).'

    available. A perfect information game refers to an environment in which each player
    can see the other player’s moves. Chess, again, is an example of a perfect information
    game. Many modern interactions are based on environments in which the moves from
    each player are hidden from other players and game theory classifies those scenarios
    as imperfect information games. From card games like poker to self-driving car
    scenarios, imperfect information games are all around us.

    games. Non-zero-sum games are often encountered in scenarios in which multiple
    players can benefit from the actions of one players. Economic interactions in

    an example of a non-zero-sum game.

    the American mathematician immortalized by Russell Crow in the movie [“A Beautiful
    Mind”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)). Essentially, a
    Nash equilibrium describes a situation in which each player has chosen a strategy
    and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep
    theirs unchanged.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Nash equilibrium is a beautiful and incredibly powerful mathematical model
    to tackle many game theory problems but it also falls short in many asymmetric
    game environments. For starters, the Nash method assumes that players have infinite
    computing power which is rarely the case in real world environments. Also, many
    Nash equilibrium models fail to account for the notion of risk which is omnipresent
    in most asymmetric games the economic markets. As a result, there are many asymmetric
    game scenarios that are hard to implement using the Nash equilibrium. This is
    particularly important in multi-agent AI systems that need to find the right balance
    between the mathematical elegance of the solution and the practicality of its
    implementation.

    in 2006 as part of a series of independent papers published by Minyi Huang, Roland
    Malhamé and Peter Caines in Montreal, and by Jean-Michel Lasry and Fields medalist
    Pierre-Louis Lions in Paris. Conceptually, MFG comprises methods and techniques
    to study differential games with a large population of rational players. These
    agents have preferences not only about their state (e.g., wealth, capital) but
    also on the distribution of the remaining individuals in the population. MFG theory
    studies generalized Nash equilibria for these systems.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A classic example of MFG is how groups of fish in a schooling swim in the same
    direction and in a coordinated matter. Theoretically, this phenomenon is really
    hard to explain but it has his roots on the fact that a fish reacts to the behavior
    of the closest group. More specifically, each fish does not care about each of
    the other fishes individually but, rather, it cares about how the fishes nearby,
    as a mass, globally move. If we translate that into mathematical terms, the reaction
    of fishes to the mass is described to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. On
    the other hand, the aggregation of the actions of the fishes which determines
    the motion of the mass corresponds to the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation. Mean-field
    game theory is the combination of these two equations.

    economist [Lloyd Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Shapley). Conceptually,
    stochastic games are played by a finite number of players on a finite state space,
    and in each state, each player chooses one of finitely many actions; the resulting
    profile of actions determines a reward for each player and a probability distribution
    on successor states.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A classic form of stochastic games is the dinning philosophers problem in which
    there are n + 1 philosophers (n ≥ 1) sitting at a round table with a bowl of rice
    in the middle. Between any two philosophers who sit next to each other lies a
    chopstick, which can be accessed by both of them. Since the table is round, there
    are as many chopsticks as there are philosophers;. To eat from the bowl, a philosopher
    needs to acquire both of the chopsticks he has access to. Hence, if one philosopher
    eats, then his two neighbors cannot eat at the same time. The life of a philosopher
    is rather simple and consists of thinking and eating; to survive, a philosopher
    needs to think and eat again and again. The task is to design a protocol that
    allows all of the philosophers to survive.

    evolution. The origins of EGT can be traced back to 1973 with [John Maynard Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Smith) and [George
    R. Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._Price)’s formalization of contests,
    analyzed as strategies, and the mathematical criteria that can be used to predict
    the results of competing strategies. Conceptually, EGT is the application of game
    theory concepts to situations in which a population of agents with diverse strategies
    interact over time to create a stable solution, through an evolutionary process
    of selection and duplication. The main idea behind EGT is that many behaviors
    involve the interaction of multiple agents in a population, and the success of
    any one of these agents depends on how its strategy interacts with that of others.
    While classic game theory has been focused on static strategies, that is to say,
    strategies that do not change over time, evolutionary game theory differs from
    classical game theory in focusing on how strategies evolve over time and which
    kind of dynamic strategies are most successful in this evolutionary process.
