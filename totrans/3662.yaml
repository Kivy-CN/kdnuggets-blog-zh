    a lot of these new applications rely on vector embedding. So let’s learn more
    about vector databases and why they are important to LLMs.

- en: Let’s first define vector embedding. **Vector embedding** is a type of data
    representation that carries semantic information that helps AI systems get a better
    understanding of the data as well as being able to maintain long-term memory.
    With anything new you’re trying to learn, the important elements are understanding
    the topic and remembering it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Embeddings** are generated by AI models, such as LLMs which contain a large
    number of features that makes their representation difficult to manage. Embedding
    represents the different dimensions of the data, to help AI models understand
    different relationships, patterns, and hidden structures.'

- en: Vector embedding using traditional scalar-based databases is a challenge, as
    it cannot handle or keep up with the scale and complexity of the data. With all
    the complexity that comes with vector embedding, you can imagine the specialized
    database it requires. This is where vector databases come into play.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Vector databases** offer optimized storage and query capabilities for the
    unique structure of vector embeddings. They provide easy search, high performance,
    scalability, and data retrieval all by comparing values and finding similarities
    between one another.'

    of vector embeddings. Yes, but no. Vector databases are very difficult to implement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Until now, vector databases were only used by tech giants that had the capabilities
    to not only develop them but also be able to manage them. Vector databases are
    expensive, therefore ensuring that they are properly calibrated is important to
    provide high performance.

    that the embedding was made from.

    result.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the user continues to make queries, it will go through the same embedding
    model to create embeddings to query that database for similar vector embeddings.
    The similarities between the vector embeddings are based on the original content,
    in which the embedding was created.

    When querying from traditional databases, we are querying for rows that match
    our query. However, vector databases work with vectors rather than strings, etc.
    Vector databases also apply a similarity metric which is used to help find a vector
    most similar to the query.

- en: A vector database is made up of different algorithms which all aid in the Approximate
    Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. This is done via hashing, graph-based search, or
    quantization which are assembled into a pipeline to retrieve neighbors of a queried
    vector.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The results are based on how close or approximate it is to the query, therefore
    the main elements that are considered are accuracy and speed. If the query output
    is slow, the more accurate the result.

    vector database, it then uses a variety of algorithms to map the vector embedding
    to data structures for faster searching.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    vector to indexed vectors, applying the similarity metric to find the nearest
    neighbor.

  prefs: []

- en: Depending on the vector database you use, the vector database will post-process
    the final nearest neighbor to produce a final output to the query. As well as
    possibly re-ranking the nearest neighbors for future reference.
