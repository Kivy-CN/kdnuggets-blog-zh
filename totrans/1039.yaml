  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before building any machine learning model, it is important to sit down carefully
    and plan what you want your model to accomplish. Before delving into writing code,
    it is important that you understand the problem to be solved, the nature of the
    dataset, the type of model to build, how the model will be trained, tested, and
    evaluated.

    the project. You may ask yourself the following questions: What is the scale of
    the project? Is it an individual project? Do I need to have a teammate? What platform
    is best for building the model? Should I use R Studio or Jupyter notebook? Will
    it require the use of advanced productivity tools such as high-performance computing
    resources, or cloud services such as AWS or Azure? What is the timeline for project
    completion?'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where you select the model that you would like to use, e.g., linear
    regression, logistic regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Deep Learning,
    K-means, Monte Carlo simulation, Time Series Analysis, etc. The dataset has to
    be divided into training, validation, and test sets. Hyperparameter tuning is
    used to fine-tune the model in order to prevent overfitting. Cross-validation
    is performed to ensure the model performs well on the validation set. After fine-tuning
    model parameters, the model is then applied to the test dataset. The model’s performance
    on the test dataset is approximately equal to what would be expected when the
    model is used for making predictions on unseen data.

- en: In this stage, the final machine learning model is put into production to start
    improving the customer experience or increasing productivity or deciding if a
    bank should approve credit to a borrower, etc. The model is evaluated in a production
    setting in order to assess its performance. This can be done by comparing the
    performance of the machine learning solution against a baseline or control solution
    using methods such as A/B testing. Any mistakes encountered when transforming
    from an experimental model to its actual performance on the production line has
    to be analyzed. This can then be used in fine-tuning the original model. In some
    large-scale projects, the data scientist would have to work with other company
    officials and software engineers or machine learning engineers in order to deploy
    the model, for example building a web-based interface that can read data in real
    time, input the data into the model, then use the final model for making predictions.
