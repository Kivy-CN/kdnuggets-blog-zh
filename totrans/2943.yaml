    modeling? Here, I will describe how it can be done and how we can “teach physics”
    to machine learning models.

    us. With sufficient information about the current situation, a well-made physics-based
    model enables us to understand complex processes and predict future events. Such
    models have already been applied all across our modern society for vastly different
    processes, such as predicting the orbits of massive space rockets or the behavior
    of nano-sized objects which are at the heart of modern electronics.

    machine learning (ML). A common key question is how you choose between a physics-based
    model and a data-driven ML model. The answer depends on what problem you are trying
    to solve. In this setting, there are two main classes of problems:'

    you cannot formulate any mathematical model to describe it and make accurate predictions.
  prefs: []

- en: Luckily, all is not lost. If you have a lot of example outcomes, you could use
    an ML-based model. Given enough example outcomes (the training data), an ML model
    should be able to learn any underlying pattern between the information you have
    about the system (the input variables) and the outcome you would like to predict
    (the output variables).

    have enough examples of the selling prices of similar houses in the same area,
    you should be able to make a fair prediction of the price for a house that is
    put up for sale.

    be described using physics-based modeling. On the contrary, combining physics
    with machine learning in a hybrid modeling scheme is a very exciting prospect.
    So exciting, in fact, that it is being studied in-depth. In connection with my
    work, I have recently been deep-diving into this intersection between machine
    learning and physics-based modeling myself.

    model, this does not mean that a machine learning approach would not work. The
    ability of ML models to learn from experience means they can also learn physics:
    Given enough examples of how a physical system behaves, the ML model can learn
    this behavior and make accurate predictions.'

    equations is familiar to many of us, although we may not realize it. For instance,
    if you have ever played football, you probably would have tried to make the perfect
    shot.  And to do that, you had to predict the path of the ball accurately. This
    is a somewhat complicated physics problem that includes several variables such
    as the force at which you kick the ball, the angle of your foot, the weight of
    the ball, the air resistance, the friction of the grass, and so on and so forth.

- en: However, when a football player kicks the ball it is not a result of complicated
    physics calculations he has performed within a fraction of a second. Rather, he
    has learned the right movements from experience and obtained a gut feeling about
    making the perfect shot.

    resembles the way humans learn. A class of ML models called artificial neural
    networks are computing systems inspired by how the brain processes information
    and learns from experience.

    have a physics-based model that is able to describe the system in question.

- en: 'One of the key aspects is the computational cost of the model: We might be
    able to describe the system in detail using a physics-based model. But solving
    this model could be complicated and time-consuming. Thus, a physics-based approach
    might break down if we aim for a model that can make real-time predictions on
    live data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, a simpler ML-based model could be an option. The computational
    complexity of an ML model is mainly seen in the training phase. Once the model
    has finished training, making predictions on new data is straightforward. This
    is where the hybrid approach of combining machine learning and physics-based modeling
    becomes highly interesting.

    flow metering in an oil well, as illustrated in the figure below. Several sensors
    can provide measurements of temperature and pressure downhole the well *P_dh,
    T_dh* as well as upstream *P_uc, T_uc*, and downstream *P_dc, T_dc* of the well

    on these measurements: i.e., the function that describes the multiphase flow rates:'

    flow of oil, gas, and, water from the production well. Utilizing this, we can
    generate lots of simulated training data for the ML model and combine them with
    real-life data from the physical well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantage of this approach is that we can perform all the computationally
    demanding parts off-line, where making fast real-time predictions is not an issue.
    By generating large amounts of training data from the physics-based model, we
    can teach the ML model the physics of the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A trained ML model can use just the sensor measurements from the physical well,
    i.e., pressures and temperatures, to predict the oil, gas, and water rates simultaneously.
    More importantly, it can make these predictions within a fraction of a second,
    making it an ideal application for running on real-time data from the production
    wells.

    wells on a production facility. I have no doubt it will become an extremely valuable
    tool for both monitoring and production optimization purposes.
