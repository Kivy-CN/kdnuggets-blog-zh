- en: For the fourth year, Kaggle surveyed its community of data enthusiasts to share
    trends within a quickly growing field. **Based on responses from 20,036 Kaggle
    members, we’ve created this report focused on the 13% (2,675 respondents) who
    are currently employed as data scientists.**

    Alternatively, you can look at the survey's [executive summary](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/surveys/Kaggle%20State%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Data%20Science%202020.pdf),
    or view and interact with the survey's [raw data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/data).

    on their own, here we bring you 3 key findings highlighted in the survey's report.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pay for data scientists is covered in the report starting on page 11\. Apples
    to apples comparisons are made of salary distributions for both US and India based
    data scientists, as are more difficult global distributions and median salaries
    by a number of select countries. While these apples to oranges comparisons are
    much less straight forward — considerations such as national cost of living differences
    and differences between data scientist pay distributions and distributions for
    *all* national professions are clearly not considered — the median salary for
    data scientists by country on page 14 nonetheless demonstrates a dramatic gap
    in global data scientist salaries.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking at the most common salaries by country, we see that US companies are
    more likely to pay higher salaries. Companies in Germany and Japan follow, with
    significantly higher salaries than the other included regions.

    of raw data. If anyone was so interested, the raw data could be leveraged to perform
    a more in-depth and nuanced analysis and comparison of global data scientist salaries.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This should come as little surprise to many, but JupyterLab retains the top
    spot for most-used interactive development environment, with 74.1% of respondents
    reporting using it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Jupyter-based IDEs continue to be the go-to tool for data scientists, with around
    three-quarters of Kaggle data scientists using it. However, this has decreased
    from last year’s 83%. Visual Studio Code is in the second spot with just over
    33%.

- en: The rest of the list contains a mix of mostly Python based IDEs and multipurpose
    text editors, alongside RStudio and MATLAB. This list could provide some evidence
    of Python's relative dominance in the field, but also remind us of R's continued
    strong position, as well as MATLAB's persistence. We can also confirm that more
    traditional IDEs are not leveraged heavily in data science and machine learning,
    perhaps not as heavily as they may be in other programming disciplines — though
    we do not have such data readily available for comparison.

- en: The most commonly used algorithms were linear and logistic regression, followed
    closely by decision trees and random forests. Of more complex methods, gradient
    boosting machines and convolutional neural networks were the most popular approaches.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unsurprisingly, linear regression, logistic regression, various decision tree
    methods, and gradient boosting machines take the top spots. The next tier of methods
    consists of a number of neural network architectures alongside Bayesian method.
    Finally, specialized neural network architectures such as transformers and GANs,
    as well as evolutionary approaches, round out the list.
