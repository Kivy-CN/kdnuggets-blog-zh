    machine learning applications. However, many challenges are unique to ML applications
    and require their own tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In traditional SWE, coding is the hard part, whereas in ML, coding is a small
    part of the battle. Developing a new model that can provide significant performance
    improvements in real-world tasks is very hard and very costly. Most companies
    won’t focus on developing ML models but will use an off-the-shelf model, e.g.,
    “if you want it, put a BERT on it.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For ML, applications developed with the most/best data win. Instead of focusing
    on improving deep learning algorithms, most companies will focus on improving
    their data. Because data can change quickly, ML applications need faster development
    and deployment cycles. In many cases, you might have to deploy a new model every
    night.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The size of ML algorithms is also a problem. The pretrained large BERT model
    has 340M parameters and is 1.35GB. Even if it can fit on a consumer device (e.g.,
    your phone), the time it takes for BERT to run inference on a new sample makes
    it useless for many real-world applications. For example, an autocompletion model
    is useless if the time it takes to suggest the next character is longer than the
    time it takes for you to type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Git does versioning by comparing differences line by line and therefore works
    well for most traditional software engineering programs. However, it’s not suitable
    for versioning datasets or model checkpoints. Pandas works well for most traditional
    dataframe manipulation but doesn’t work on GPUs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Row-based data formats like CSV work well for applications using less data.
    However, if your samples have many features, and you only want to use a subset
    of them, using row-based data formats still requires you to load all features.
    Columnar file formats like PARQUET and OCR are optimized for that use case.

    the deployment team, and the two teams only communicate via the p-managers: product
    managers, program managers, project managers. Small companies, whose employees

    which features to include in the OSS, which to include in the paid version without

    still far from being a commodity, some hypothesize that investors will lose hope
    in AI altogether. Google has frozen hiring for ML researchers. Uber laid off the
    research half of their AI team. Both decisions were made pre-COVID. There’s the
    rumor that due to a large number of people taking ML courses, there will be far
    more people with ML skills than ML jobs.

    that can afford to do ML research, but there will be no shortage of companies
    that need tooling to bring ML into their production.
