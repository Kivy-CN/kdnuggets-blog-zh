- en: If you are a Torch user, and interested in large-scale deep learning, you may
    have tried the recently released deep learning modules by Facebook Artificial
    Intelligence Research. Their optimized deep-learning modules for Torch, [fbcunn](https://github.com/facebook/fbcunn),
    is widely discussed.

- en: These modules are significantly faster than the default ones in Torch and have
    accelerated our research projects by allowing us to train larger neural nets in
    less time.

- en: The most important one of these released modules is a fast FFT-based convolutional
    layer running on NVIDIA GPU.  They claim that their FFT-based convolutional layer
    code is faster than any other publicly available code when used to train popular
    architectures. Their experiments show that it can be up to 23.5* faster than NVIDIA’s
    CuDNN, which is a GPU-accelerated library for deep neural networks. The speedup
    is more considerable as the kernel size becomes larger (from 5*5).

- en: The code is based on [NYU researchers’ published algorithm](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5851v5.pdf),
    performing convolutions as products in the Fourier domain. Instead of performing
    convolutions between two sets of 2-Dmatrics directly, they proposed to compute
    the Fourier transform of the matrices in each set first and perform pairwise convolution
    as products. Because of the large scale of feature maps, using FFTs accelerates
    training.
