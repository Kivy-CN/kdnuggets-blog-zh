    and high expectations. Each company has its unique definition of what a Data Scientist
    does, this is dependent on their expectations.

- en: I dived into the world of Data Science after completing a 9-month Bootcamp in
    September 2019\. The curriculum included Linear Algebra, Statistics, Applied Modelling,
    SQL, Machine Learning, Computer Science, and Production Deployments (e.g. git,
    Flask, AWS). I was excited to be part of something that was growing at a ridiculous
    rate. Tesla had self-driving cars, Instagram was creating crazy algorithms, and
    nearly every company was implementing the use of data in their business plans.

    amounts of data, where I would need to find patterns between the variables. There
    was going to be a lot of data cleaning and implementing machine learning models
    to gain a better understanding of current and future outputs. I was seeing vacancies
    for Data Scientists in nearly every sector, from the obvious, like Amazon to newbies,
    like major skincare brands. I believed I was going into a career that every company
    needed, and although that is true, the reality was different.

    entailed. However, in my recent years in the industry and also speaking to other
    Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and Analysts, I started to see ways
    in which data science has failed to meet the expectations in the industry.

    decision-making process using data science, have little or no education or understanding
    in actual Data Science.

- en: Where does that leave you as a Data Scientists? When you are going through the
    Data Science workflow, there are going to be times when you’re blocked or need
    advice from an expert in the field. Speaking to executives with no knowledge in
    Data Science will make your work life difficult as the responsibilities will fall
    onto you to resolve it.

- en: This becomes a major problem when companies implement the top-down approach,
    which is when the decision-making process occurs at the highest level and is then
    communicated to the rest of the team. This approach is still heavily implemented
    in a lot of data-driven companies, leading to hierarchy and the overall satisfaction
    of the workforce. As a Data Scientist, you may not have a seat a the table or
    be valued and respected enough to be a part of the decision-making process. You
    will be very frustrated as it was your time and energy that went into cleaning
    the data, building models, and producing accurate outputs.

    start-up companies over the last decade. Some start-ups do well from the jump
    and build efficiently, however, the majority have <100 employees.

- en: Once you exclude the executives, managing directors, HR team, and more, there
    are only a few employees who are proficient in data analysis, data visualisation,
    machine learning, and SQL. If you are one of the primary Data Scientists on the
    team, there is a high chance you will be overwhelmed with the multiple requests
    from different team members.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In cases like this, there is no harm in saying no to these requests. There comes
    a point where too much work starts to affect you and your well-being. At this
    point, the company should understand the growth of the company and start looking
    into expanding the data team.

    you need to know a wide range of concepts in and out! However, don’t let this

    better chance you have. Keep going and practising the top interview questions
    till you feel confident. You can ask your hiring managers for details of the interview
    process, which will help you prepare.

    with minimal or no direction. This can be due to it being requested by members
    of the team that have no knowledge of Data Science, or because of the misconceived
    notion that Data Scientists know everything. My advice to you is to work closely
    with others in the data team, such as software engineers and analysts to support
    you through this. If you are unfortunately the only data person on the team, having
    an expert or highly proficient mentor to advise you is a good stance to take.
