    do great charts because I dislike confusing charts. You may think of me as the
    Marie Kondo of charts or the Cole Knaflic of Dubai, and you might not be entirely
    wrong. In this post, I will share **7 principles*** to go from *Aha-charts* to
    *Wow-charts*. Let’s get our hands dirty with a dataset from a recent KDnuggets
    poll.

    ML instinct is to do a scatter plot to identify interesting clusters. The X-axis
    can be the percentage of respondents that **have** a given skill, and the Y-axis,
    percentage of respondents that would like to have that skill (**want**). However,
    there are too many data points for a human to make sense of it. It is a textbook
    case of death by information overload.

    with the gravity metaphor (highly wanted, high Y). Another unspoken rule (this
    one by Guy Kawasaki) is that “you want (desired goals) to be high and to the right
    [[3]](#_ftn3)”. In this case, the most desired skill (Deep Learning) is on the
    wrong side – we need to flip the X-axis.

    [[6]](#_ftn6) as the prediction for the future if all respondents could achieve
    their learning goals. Now we can think about the gap between present and future.
    This chart was done in ggplot2\. Luckily the way ggplot2 plots differently negative
    and positive stack bars comes handy in this case. Notice also how we avoid the
    temptation of ordering the bars by ascending order because it would create a spurious
    pattern in the crest.'

    disseminate knowledge. Data visualization is one of the ways to do so. Unfortunately,
    there is a lot of good work out there that goes unnoticed, like [this](https://usafacts.org/) or
    [this](http://letsfreecongress.org/) or [this](https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2016/spiralling-global-temperatures/).
    I hope these new superpowers get you going to start changing the world with compelling
    charts.
