    a post which attempted to aggregate and organize some of the available, free quality
    material into a short but helpful crash course. However, the included material
    is now getting stale and many of the links no longer work, which makes sense considering
    that the original has been around for a few years at this point. As folks have
    recently been asking for an updated version, I thought it would be a good time
    to revisit the concept and put together a new learning path for mastering SQL
    for data science.

    make sure we view 'mastery' in a relative sense, however, and not expect to be
    scripting at database guru-levels after getting through the materials. The learning
    path is aimed at those with some understanding of databases, programming, computer
    science concepts, and/or data management in an abstract sense, who are wanting
    to be able to use SQL to manage and query their own data and scale up to larger
    systems.

- en: Very simply, SQL is the language for managing and querying data in relational
    database management systems (RDBMS).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So intertwined are the terms SQL and RDBMS that they are often conflated, sometimes
    by the uninitiated, but often simply out of convenience, and the term SQL is used
    adversarially to distinguish relational systems from non-relational database systems,
    which are often categorized by the umbrella term "NoSQL." Yet, SQL skills aren't
    wasted on non-RDBMS systems; the top data processing frameworks all have some
    implementation of SQL that sits atop their architecture.

    model, relational algebra, and related concepts. This is a great starting point.

    below, titled "SQL - A Brief Review," by Charles Germany, for some very quick
    insight into where SQL came from, along with some syntax by way of a few short
    examples. As with the resources and examples below the video, don't worry about
    fully understanding the syntax, just get a feel for what SQL is doing, what it
    can be used for, and what it looks like.

    (via Data Carpentry) does what its title suggests, while **[List of SQL Commands](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/sql-commands)**
    (via Codecademy) provides a more broad overview of SQL commands and usage. This
    second resource in particular should make for a handy reference later on. Some
    of these commands are covered in greater detail in subsequent steps, so, again,
    don''t worry about understanding everything. At the same time, these initial examples
    are rather intuitive, and so should be helpful for your understanding.'

    You may not want to enter every SQL statement you encounter, but having an SQL
    interpreter up and running just makes sense. I suggest installing SQLite locally;
    it is a simple, but capable, SQL installation.

    with UPDATE are some of the most heavily-used commands, and are good places to

    a testament to the ease of SQL than the actual difficulty of learning about joins.

    of mastery. You can never know enough SQL, and as with so many other skills, practice
