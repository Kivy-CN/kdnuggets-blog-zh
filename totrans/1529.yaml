    so let’s unpack what this means.

- en: Critical thinking in data science can be broken down into two aspects. First
    is the **ability to develop the question**. In practice, this involves extensive
    interviewing with users of the data science or analytics results to truly grasp
    the problems that need to be solved. Many practitioners, including several speakers
    at a conference I attended recently, note that users are frequently unable to
    express the problem properly.

- en: That’s not quite how I’d describe it. The process of developing the question
    requires collaboration between the data scientists who know much more about the
    data and the analytical tools and the business owners who know much more about
    the business goals and metrics. The collaboration leads to sharing of knowledge
    and symbiotic problem solving.

- en: The second aspect of critical thinking is **the ability to question the data**.
    Experienced analysts do not ever dump raw data into a software and see what comes
    out. Experience tells us what adjustments might be necessary to remove potentially
    distracting or misleading features in the data.

- en: STEM training is particularly lacking in these two aspects of critical thinking.
    A typical problem in a math, science or engineering class includes (a) a well-posed
    question, and (b) nicely-shaped data, and the student’s challenge is to figure
    out which formula or method can use the provided data to answer the specified
    question. There is no need to develop the question further; in fact, any student
    trying to change the question will be penalized! There is also no need to question
    the data. If the data should be questioned, then the problem will have no single
    correct answer, which doesn’t fit well with traditional academic STEM training.
    (By contrast, social science graduates are better trained to handle complexity
    and incomplete data.)

    ), I showed how a data analyst can use critical thinking to question the data
    and avoid making embarrassing erroneous conclusions. Analysts at the National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) failed to notice gaping holes in
    the data submitted by Tesla when they endorsed Tesla’s claim that the auto-pilot
    feature would reduce crash rates by 40 percent. An independent consultant succeeded
    in getting the data released, and noticed a large number of blank entries. When
    the missing values were imputed using a standard method (mean imputation), the
    reported benefit of auto-pilot vanished *entirely*.

- en: Bridging this skill gap is a key goal of mine when I started Principal Analytics
    Prep. We accomplish this by fostering in-class, hands-on learning with practitioners
    who have years of practical work experience, and finding students with diverse
    backgrounds to consider both science and social science approaches to problem
    solving.
