    ChatGPT can connect with third-party applications with the plugin and enhance
    the tools to perform additional actions. One is to perform data analysis, which
    we will explore further in this article.

    with this plugin. To do that, we must log in to the [Noteable](https://app.noteable.io/)
    and create the project. It’s free, so we don’t need to set up a credit card or
