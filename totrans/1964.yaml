    from previous builds. Let’s learn how to optimize a Dockerfile to make the best
    use of Docker's layer caching mechanism.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Docker images are built in layers, where each instruction in the Dockerfile
    creates a new layer. For example, instructions like `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, and
    `ADD` each create a new layer in the resulting image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Docker uses a content-addressable storage mechanism to manage image layers.
    Each layer is **identified by a unique hash** that Docker calculates based on
    the contents of the layer. Docker compares these hashes to determine if it can
    reuse a layer from the cache.

    scripts) much earlier in the Dockerfile can help maximize cache hits.

- en: The base image layer often doesn’t change frequently. Environment variables
    are unlikely to change often, so setting them early helps reuse the cache for
    subsequent layers. Note that we copy the initialization scripts before the application
    code. This is because copying files that don’t change frequently before those
    that do helps in leveraging the cache.

    layer. This maximizes the reuse of cached layers, leading to faster builds.
