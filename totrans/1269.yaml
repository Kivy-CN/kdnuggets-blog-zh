    or more every single day. This has taught me the importance of data science when
    it comes to industrial work:** *how much value you are adding to an organization
    with your skill set***. ***You define value by building something you have an
    interest in or by building something to solve a problem***. You choose what to

    scientists, data analysts, and machine learning engineers (offline, in the physical

    know anyone then you can always check blogs and articles.

    on building stuff than mere learning and education (e.g. deployment and production

    have it and some people don’t. I am inclined to say that maybe smart people don’t
    have this problem (the smart ones I have met or read about, they don’t). People
    like me spend a lifetime trying to beat it. It is a jail, trust me. It is quite
    frustrating to live with a mindset of “only one way to do something”. Ideas don’t
    have any limits if you look at real-life stories.

    no matter which field you will work in, this one will show up there, it absolutely
    has nothing to do with the tech. I am still trying to work on it. A solution I
    have found so far is when I can’t find my way around a problem then I will get
    off the machine and go for a walk if it is evening or read a completely unrelated
    book if it is not evening (some non-fiction e.g.) or go on a motorcycle ride and
    completely forget about the problem. Then I will come back later and try to learn
    the same thing from a different article or blog post while not referring to the
    original point where I was stuck. Just a fresh new perspective on the same problem
    from someone else.

    Go read about it a bit. I thought I was *the only one suffering* from it. But
    then I realized it is so common. Yes, the market is competitive and because of [the
    current pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), many have
    lost jobs. I have seen posts on LinkedIn where several data scientists and machine
    learning engineers have lost jobs. I have seen them even literally begging to
    “like and share” that they are looking for a job. It is heartbreaking to see that.
    Everyone deserves a good life.

    brought many businesses to a halt while some businesses have their client number
    shot sky-high (podcast and video conferencing services for one). In such disruptive
    times, we need to be more resilient to pain and suffering and find ways to strengthen
    our resolve. I believe it is not by chance that we were born in a certain year
    and that is how we got in the middle of this pandemic. I think we were supposed
    to learn from it, we are supposed to make[ a better life out of these times](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/04/learning-crisis-data-science.html).

    on learning from each other to make ourselves better.
