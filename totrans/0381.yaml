    you know that’s not quite true. Twitter, Meta, Netflix, Microsoft, and dozens
    of other tech companies have all made massive layoffs lately. The ones who avoided
    layoffs have implemented hiring freezes. Overall, nearly 90k workers in the tech
    sector got laid off in 2022.

    though it’s difficult to say for sure how much any of them are specifically to
    blame.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the rate of unprecedented growth at tech companies was always somewhat
    unsustainable. COVID made many e-commerce and ad-basec companies experience rapidfire
    growth that wasn’t able to keep up as consumers started going back to normal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After a decade of overvaluations, over-hiring, and VC-subsidized growth, the
    layoff chickens are coming home to roost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, as you’re no doubt sick of hearing, the economy is weird right now.
    There are supply-chain problems. Inflation is sky-high. There’s geo-political
    turmoil. All this caused the tech sector growth to slow down – just enough that
    tech companies started panicking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, there was pressure from multiple sides. Take a company like Twitter,
    currently under Elon Musk’s unpredictable and chaotic leadership. Musk made deep
    cuts to headcount, and as of today, Twitter is still standing (albeit somewhat
    glitchily). This success makes boards at other companies ask why they’re paying
    the salaries of so many employees when Twitter proves it’s possible to slash employee
    numbers in half, and still function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s also an element of social contagion. Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at
    the Stanford Graduate School of Business, believes that copycat behavior may be
    to blame for much of the layoffs we’re seeing right now. “Could there be a tech
    recession? Yes. Was there a bubble in valuations? Absolutely. Did Meta overhire?
    Probably. But is that why they are laying people off? Of course not. Meta has
    plenty of money. These companies are all making money. They are doing it because
    other companies are doing it,” Pfeffer [told](https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried/#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20in,and%20starts%20ups%20as%20well.)
