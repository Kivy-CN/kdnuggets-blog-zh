    by looking at the big picture. It helps create insights from your data so you
    can make informed decisions about your business and where you want it to go.
  prefs: []

    Data tables are useful for combining data sources, drilling into data, and getting
    visual answers, right away!

    Data joining is when you perform tasks with multiple tables or views from the
    same source (e.g., tables from the same database, Excel sheets inside the same
    workbook, text files within the same directory). In most cases, Tableau performs
    well when you join them.'

    and how to tell Tableau what it is. With a data join, once you’ve connected the
    table or view from which you’re joining, all you need to do is add an extra step
    where you drag the field that joins both tables together on the “Join” shelf.'

- en: A data source in Tableau connects your source data to Tableau. It's simply the
    sum of your data (either as a live connection or an extraction), the connection
    metadata, the names of tables or worksheets containing data, and the modifications
    you apply to data in Tableau. This comprises metadata such as computations, renamed
    features, and default layout, as well as how the data is integrated.

    a better user experience. If you need access to multiple tables from a workbook,
    you may want to create separate data sources that can be used for each analytical
    scenario.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Joins are important because they allow us to combine information from multiple
    sources into a single visualization. A lot of the time they're used to join data
    from different worksheets in a workbook, but there's no limit to what you can
    do with joins! You can use them to combine data from different databases, files
    on your computer, or even from completely different sources!
  prefs: []

- en: While working with multiple tables in Tableau the best approach is to define
    the joins in the data connection window. In this way, you are not defining a specific
    query – you are simply defining how the tables corelate to one another.

    should use the 64-bit version of Tableau Desktop if you’re using blends with large
    numbers of unique values. Blends that rely on many unique values are most likely
    to take a longer time for computations.

    to combine data from multiple sources. Data integration works with row-level joins,
    whereas blending works on the results of each data source. You must use data integration
    if you want to work with more data or flow at a faster rate.

- en: Data is not easy to work with. It may be something that every business seeks,
    but it can be quite an ordeal to gather it, analyze it, and determine its usefulness.
    Furthermore, this process must be repeated each time a business wants or needs
    to use data. Instead of having to jump through multiple hoops and overcome several
    difficult hurdles, all you have to do is tell Tableau how you want your data prepared.
