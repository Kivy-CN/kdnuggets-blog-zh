- en: Geocoding is the beginning of Spatial Analysis. Whether geocoding a place or
    residence, an accurate geocoder is the first step to make sure your analysis is
    on the right track. This tutorial will take you through two options that have
    automated the geocoding process for the user using Python, Selenium and Google
    Geocoding API. Automation is something every Data Scientist needs to learn. But
    automating workflows is unique to every person and not everyone will have the
    same workflow. Automation is something to strive for when we believe that repeating
    the same process is too time consuming and your time is better spent doing something
    else while your automated process will take care of everything.

- en: Google used to allow a certain amount (about 2,500 API calls) for its geocoding
    per day for free. This is an annoying limitation but one that allowed for highly
    accurate geocoding even if your address had some spelling mistakes and even better
    if you had a place name. **However recently google now charges for every API call**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If not mistaken, currently the damage is $5 for every 1,000 API calls and $4
    for every API call above 100,000\. To put it into perspective, for the first 100,000,
    you will be spending $0.005 for every API call. Anything above 500,000 may need
    a call to the their sales team. See [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-and-billing)
    for their Geocoding API billing. **Every new sign up makes you eligible for $200
    credit.**

    their service. The address used can include place names as well and this should
    even improve the results most of the time. If it can be found on google maps when
    you manually check, it can be used with google's geocoder to extract the coordinates.

    ''Longitude'', ''Google Address''. It will be much faster than any custom script
    built. Google is undoubtedly the most preferred geocoding API as it is reliable
    for a client side project. In a business setting, if a client wishes to have the
    coordinates of their customers residence mapped, visualized and analyzed, explaining
    the use of google to geocode will be simple and understandable to them.'

    restrictions and a relatively cheap price per API call, it can be feasible to
    a certain extent.
