    given the 'heart disease prediction' dataset, perhaps an improvised version of
    the one available on Kaggle. I had seen this dataset before and often come across
    various self-proclaimed data science gurus teaching naïve people how to predict
    heart disease through machine learning.

    example of how not to apply machine learning to a problem, especially where a
    lot of domain experience is required.

    set.

- en: '**Dive straight into the problem syndrome** – Well this is the first mistake
    many people make. Jumping straight into the problem and thinking which Machine
    learning algorithm to apply. Doing EDA et all as part of this process is not *thinking*
    about the problem. Rather it is a sign that you have already accepted the notion
    that the problem needs a data science solution. Instead one of the pertinent questions
    that needs to be asked before starting any analysis is, “Is this problem even
    predictable through application of machine learning?”.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Blind faith in Data** – This is an extension of the first point. Diving straight
    into the problem means you have blind faith in the data. People assume the data
    to be true and do not make an effort to scrutinize the data. For example, the
    dataset only provided systolic blood pressure. If you spoke to any doctor or even
    a paramedic, they would tell you that systolic blood pressure alone does not give
    the full picture. Reporting of diastolic level is important too. Many don''t even
    ask the question "are the features enough to predict the outcome or more features
    are needed".'

- en: '**Not enough data per patient: **Let’s take a look at the data set above. If
    you notice, there is only one data point under each feature for a patient. The
    fundamental problem here is that features like blood pressure, cholesterol, heart
    beat are not static. **They range**. Blood pressure of a person varies hour to
    hour and on a daily basis, so does heat beat. So when it comes to prediction problem
    there is no telling weather 135 mm hg blood pressure was one of the factors to
    cause the heart disease or was it 140, all while the data set might be reporting
    130 mm hg. Ideally, multiple measurements need to be had for each feature for
    a patient.'

    failure rate of data science application in health care is that the data scientists
    applying the algorithm do not have adequate medical knowledge.'

    and statistical tests are conducted to infer causality.

- en: In the case study, any machine learning algorithm is just trying to map the
    input to the output while reducing some error metric. Also, the machine learning
    algorithm by themselves are not classifiers, we make them as classifiers by setting
    some cut-off or threshold. **Again, this cut off is not decided to deduce causality** but
    just to get "favorable metrics".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aggravating this problem is the usage of low code libraries. This case study
    is a case in point example why low code libraries can be dangerous. Low code libraries
    fit a dozen or more algorithms. Most are not even aware how some of these algorithms
    work! They just pick the 'best' algorithm based on metrics like F1, Precision,
    Recall and Accuracy.

    is not enough, one needs to prove causation. Machine learning classifier algorithms
    do not answer the ‘causation’ part.

    least, many believe that by fitting a ML algorithm to a *healthcare* data set
    and getting some accuracy metrics, they have solved a real healthcare problem.
    Nothing can be further from truth than this, especially when it pertains to healthcare
    domain.'

- en: There are perhaps thousands of business problems that genuinely warrant data
    science / machine learning solutions. But at the same time, one should not fall
    into the trap of “To a person with hammer, everything looks like a nail”. Seeing
    everything as a nail (data science problem) and machine learning algorithms as
    (hammer) can be very counterproductive. Much of 80% failure rate in data science
    application to business problem could be attributed to this.

    treatments first before prescribing heavy dosage medicines or surgery. Similarly,
    a good data scientist should ask certain pertinent questions first before blindly
    applying a dozen ML algorithms to the problem.
