    the SLAs the business needs. Separation in the virtualization sphere is done through
    use of groupings of servers and virtual machines in their own confined resource
    pools – so as to limit their effect on external workloads.

    engineers executed a set of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on Spark clusters,
    where each node in the cluster is held in a virtual machine. These tests were
    also executed on the same servers without virtualization present and the result
    of the testing were compared. Here is one example of the results.

    with, so that the model will recognize certain patterns in the data. These example
    sets were in the 700 million to 2.1 billion entry range in the above setup. Each
    example had 40 features or different aspects of one record of the data (such as
    the amount of the transaction and the expiry date for a credit card purchase)
  prefs: []

- en: The model, once trained on a large number of examples, is then presented with
    a new transaction instance. This could be a credit card transaction or a customer’s
    application for a new credit card for example. The analysis model is asked to
    classify that particular transaction as a good one or a fraudulent one. Using
    statistical techniques, the model gives a binary answer to this question. This
    type of analysis is called a binary classification. Several other kinds of machine
    learning algorithms were tested also.

- en: You choose the amount of memory, number of virtual CPUs, storage layout and
    networking configuration for a virtual machine at creation time – and you can
    change it later if you need to. These are all software constructs rather than
    hardware ones, so they are more open to change. In big data practice so far, we
    have seen a minimum value of 4 vCPUs and a general rule of thumb value of 16 vCPUs
    for higher-end virtual machines running Hadoop/Spark type workloads. Applications
    that can make use of more than 16 vCPUs are rare but still feasible. Those would
    for code that is highly parallelized with significant numbers of concurrent threads
    within them, for example.
  prefs: []

- en: The amount of memory required on a virtual machine can be as large as your physical
    memory, although we see configured memory at 256Gb or 512Gb values for contemporary
    workloads. Basic operation for the classic Hadoop worker nodes can fit within
    a 128Gb memory boundary for many workloads. These sizes will be determined by
    the application platform architects, but it is also valuable for the end user,
    the data scientist and data engineer, to understand the constraints that apply
    to any one virtual machine. Given the hardware capacity, these numbers can be
    expanded in short order to see whether the work completes faster under new conditions.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some cloud environments, you get to make the choice about fitting virtual
    machine onto host servers and the racks that contain them; in others you don’t.
    Where you are offered this choice, you can make decisions that will optimize your
    application’s performance. For example, in private clouds, you can choose to not
    overcommit the physical memory or physical CPU power of your servers with too
    many virtual machines or too large a configuration of virtual machine resources.
     Avoiding this over-commitment of physical resources generally helps the performance
    of those applications that are resource intensive, such as data analysis ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A corollary question here is how many virtual machines there should be on any
    one physical host server. In our testing work with virtualization, two to four
    suitably-sized virtual machines per server can yield good results as a starting
    point – and this number can be increased as experience grows with the platform
    and the workload. Where there is visibility to the server hardware type and configuration
    available to you, then NUMA boundaries should be respected in sizing your virtual
    machines, so as to get the absolute best performance from the machine. The virtualization
    best practices document mentioned above has detailed technical advice in this
    area.

- en: '**Different Software Roles in the Virtual Machines**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most contemporary distributed data platforms, the software process roles
    are separated into “master” and “worker” nodes. The controlling processes run
    on the former and the executors that drive individual parts of the work are run
    in the workers. You create a template virtual machine (a “golden master”) for
    each of these different roles and then copy or clone that virtual machine depending
    on how many instances of that role you need. There may be an option to install
    the analysis software components themselves into the template virtual machine
    and thereby save on repeating that installation when it comes to instantiation
    of the clones or members of the cluster. These nodes are customizable with new
    software services at any time in the lifetime of that cluster, through the vendors’
    management tools. We can likewise de-commission certain roles from the cluster
    in the same way, such as when we need fewer workers to carry out the analysis
    work.

- en: '**Assigning Groups of Computing Resources to Different Teams**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An inherent value of the virtualization approach for the cloud is the pooling
    of the hardware resources, so that parts of the total CPU/memory aggregate power
    can be carved out and dedicated for specific purposes and teams. Virtualization
    includes the concept of a “resource pool” with the capability to reserve a set
    compute and memory power for this purpose (across several machines). One department’s
    set of virtual machines lives within the confined space of its resource pool while
    a separate department lives in another. These may be adjacent to each other physically.
    When needed, more compute resources can be allocated to one or the other dynamically.
    This gives the manager of a data science department that has competing requests
    from his/her teams much more control over the allocations of resources, depending
    on the needs and relative importance of each team’s project work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The creation of a set of virtual machines for a data scientists’ use is of course
    much more rapid than providing them with new physical machines, yielding better
    time to productive work. The further flexibility for expansion and contraction
    of the population of virtual machines in that set is even more important. In larger
    deployments of analytic applications that we have seen, rapid expansion occurs
    in the initial stages, going from 20 nodes (virtual machines) to over 300 nodes
    in a single cluster. As time moves on and new types of workload appear, that large
    infrastructure may contract, so as to fit a new one beside it on the same hardware
    collection, though separated into a different resource pool. That type of flexibility
    is a function of virtualization. The strict ownership boundaries that delineated
    private collections of servers for individual teams are broken down here.

- en: The data scientist/engineer wants to know why the query is taking so long to
    complete. We know this phenomenon well from the history of databases of various
    kinds. SQL engines are among the most popular layers on top of big data infrastructure
    today – indeed, almost every vendor has got one. There is a constant need to find
    the inefficient or poorly structured query that is hogging the system. Virtual
    machines and resource pools provide isolation of that rogue query to begin with.
    But further to that, if the cloud provider allows it, being able to see the effects
    of your code at the infrastructure level provides valuable data towards tracing
    its effects and optimizing its execution time.

- en: In our opening remarks, we mentioned public, private and hybrid clouds. There
    is a wide interest in using common infrastructure and management tools across
    these types of clouds. When these base elements are the same for private and public
    cloud, then applications can live on either, as best fits the business need. In
    fact, the application can move from one to the other in an orderly fashion, without
    having to change. The lines will blur for the data scientist/engineer as a particular
    analysis work project may start off as an experiment in a public cloud and as
    it matures, it migrates to a private cloud for optimization of its performance.
    The reverse move may also take place. Announcements were made in late 2016 that
    the full VMware Software Defined Data Center portfolio will execute in AWS as
    a service. This common infrastructure across private and public cloud extends
    the flexibility and choice for the data scientist/data engineer. Analysis workloads
    on the VMware Cloud on AWS may now reach into S3 storage on AWS in a local fashion,
    within a common data center, thus bringing down the latency of access for data.
