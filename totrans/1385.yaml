    the most talked-about technologies in recent years, and rightfully so. These advancements
    in the world of tech have taken automation and business processes to the next
    level. Organizations of all sizes are investing millions of dollars into research
    and people to build these incredibly powerful data-driven applications.

    develop machine learning and data science applications. While Python and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
    have become favorites for building these programs, many organizations are turning
    to [Java application development](https://www.bairesdev.com/insights/java-development-services/?utm_source=kdnuggets&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=content&utm_content=middle)
    to meet their needs. From enterprise-level business solutions and navigation systems
    to mobile phones and applications, Java is applicable to nearly every area of
    technology.

    team](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javahistory-index-198355.html)
    created Java while employed by Sun Microsystems (owned by Oracle). Over 20 years
    later, Java is still among the top-ranked and [most lucrative](https://blog.edx.org/the-4-most-lucrative-programming-skills-you-can-learn-online/)

    in the world of development and technology in general, old means outdated. However,
    this is not the case. Java’s age means that many companies are probably already
    working with a significant amount of the programming language without even knowing
    it. Infrastructure, software, applications, and many other working parts of the
    company’s tech may already be built upon Java, which can help simplify integration
    and minimize compatibility issues.

    machine learning and data science, as it enables the developer to write code that
    is identical across multiple platforms. It also allows them to create custom tools
    at a faster pace and features a load of IDEs that help to improve overall productivity
    levels.

    give developers the power to manage the enormous capabilities of the Java language.
    This simplifies the development of large data science or enterprise projects significantly

    explicit and specific about the variables and types of data that they deal with.
    Sometimes confused with static typing, strong typing makes it easier to manage
    large data applications while also simplifying codebase maintenance. It also helps
    developers avoid the need to write unit tests.

    must consider before beginning a project. Java makes application scaling an easier
    process for data scientists and programmers alike. This makes it a great choice
    for the building of larger or more complex Artificial Intelligence and Machine
    Learning applications, especially when they are being built from scratch.

    and Machine learning are not the fastest options. Java is perfectly suited for
    these speed-critical projects as it is fast executing. Many of the most popular
    websites and social applications of today rely on Java for their data engineering
    needs, including LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.

    helps development teams build a multitude of projects. From data mining and data
    analysis to the building of Machine Learning applications, Java is more than applicable
    to the field of data science. It’s one of the most preferred languages for these
    tasks and has plenty of reasons why. If you’re about to tackle a machine learning
    project, consider using it. You’ll be surprised how much you can get out of it.
