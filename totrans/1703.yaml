    The advantage was that you could try out different algorithms without the huge

    coming to life across every aspect of data science. Data integration and data
    preparation platforms have become smart enough to plug-and-play data sources,
    self-repair when errors occur in data pipelines, and even self-manage maintenance
    or data quality tasks based on knowledge learned from human interactions. Augmented
    analytics offerings have started to deliver on the promise of democratizing machine
    learning. Lastly, automated machine learning platforms with pre-packaged best-practice
    algorithm design blueprints and partially automated feature engineering capabilities
    have rapidly become game-changers in the digital era analytics arsenal.

    **automated artificial intelligence** seamlessly unified into more analytics and
    decision-making processes. As organizations adapt, I anticipate numerous concerns
    to be raised around knowing how automated decisions are made and learning how
    to responsibly guide these systems in our imperfect world. Looming EU General
    Data Protection Regulation compliance deadlines will further elevate our need
    to open up analytics black boxes, ensure proper use, and dutifully govern personal
    data.'
