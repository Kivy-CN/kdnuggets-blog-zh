    time, eliminating car fatalities, and much more. It also poses existential risks
    for humanity, as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking warned. Is AGI possible and if
    so, how close are we to AGI ?

    AlphaZero) achieving superhuman performance in Go, Chess, and other games, and
    with computers now able to recognize images, understand speech, drive cars, and
    diagnose radiology images as well as humans or better, AGI seems to be getting
    closer.

    they are in humans and their economy. Amazon Mechanical Turk can do the same things
    that a human can do (because they are humans), and it is more profitable than
    building the technological singularity.

    so similar to a god, which would then be owned by a company, would be the worst
