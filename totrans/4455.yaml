    methods and visualisations. But the raw data need to be processed to convert it
    into a usable shape. Data Preparation is the most important and foremost part
    of Data Science. It involves data pre-processing and data wrangling.

    For example, there might be many entries for a shopper leading to duplicity, or
    there might a typo in noting down the email id of a customer, or some of the questions
    might have been left blank by a surveyor. With an uncleaned dataset, no matter
    what type of algorithm you try, you will never get accurate results. That is why
    data scientists spend a considerable amount of time on data cleaning.

    running a basic descriptive statistics test provides an initial sense check of

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data is usually collected from many sources and joined together to form one
    dataset. This might lead to the duplicity of observations. This might not be problematic
    if observations (small in number) are repeated a few times but could lead to erroneous
    behaviour if observation(s) are repeated far too many times. Hence, it is better
    to drop duplicate observations to have a cleaner dataset.

    task. For example, if you were analysing the shopping behaviour of women only,
    you would not require observations for men in your dataset — row-wise.

    zero or very low variance (for continuous features). Such features do not provide
    much information and are not useful for building predictive models.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Categorical columns could have a high number of classes due to typos or inconsistent
    capitalization. For example, the gender column might have many classes like male,
    female, m, f, M, and F, these represent only two levels — Male and Female. Such
    classes should be mapped to proper levels and the rest of the levels should be
    dropped. Bar plots could be used to highlight such issues.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tree-based algorithms and boosting methods are insensitive to outliers due to
    the intrinsic nature of the recursive binary splitting approach used to partition
    the feature space. These algorithms are the best bet when there are outliers in
    the input features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there are outliers in the target variable, tree-based algorithms are good
    but care must be taken to choose the loss function. Reason being that if we use
    the mean squared error function, then the difference is squared and would highly
    influence the next tree since boosting attempts to fit the (gradient of the) loss.
    However, there are more robust error functions that can be used for boosted tree
    methods like Huber Loss and Mean Absolute Deviation loss.
