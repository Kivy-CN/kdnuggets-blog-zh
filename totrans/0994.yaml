    the top social media applications. One thing I do is follow Instagram accounts
    around data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

- en: An instagram page created by Google which aimed to inspire girls to code. We
    all know that the tech industry is very male dominant, making it harder for women
    to feel comfortable to enter the industry. The page celebrates women in the tech
    industry and how they can potentially inspire other women from all age groups
    to enter the industry. They also teamed up with Teen Vogue to get high school
    and college-aged females more interested in possibly pursuing a career in tech.

    is to present machine learning in an intuitive way. They also can be found on
    Medium and YouTube. I personally like how their content is consistent in format
    and presentation. They provide simple but informative slides about different topics,
    such as statistics, math, data science and more! They have over 100 posts, along
    with their medium and YouTube content for you to learn from.

    page for you to follow. It provides you with information on careers, different
    courses that you can take to get there, theory knowledge of machine learning,
    and much more. On top of all of that, to make your programming career a little
    better, it has constant memes to help you get through the transition of learning
    a new programming language. Nothing wrong with having a little giggle whilst you’re
    learning at the same time.
