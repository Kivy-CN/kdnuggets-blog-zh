    honor of International Women''s Day on March 8, we bring you the profiles of 19
    inspiring women in AI, Big Data, Data Science, and Machine Learning. The number
    of women in this field has been relatively low, but I believe that AI and Machine
    Learning can only benefit from increasing diversity and participation of women.'

    Machine Learning](/2018/03/inspiring-women-ai-big-data-science.html). That post
    was quite popular, but we received many comments about other inspiring women not
    included in that list.
