    reports a gender bias exists in AI and, in 2018, found that only 12% of AI researchers
    are women. When I started my career as a Data Analyst, a Data Science engineer
    position was not widely available in Ukraine. And mostly, it wasn’t available
    for female Maths graduates without special skills and experience. Self-education
    and getting acquainted with ML algorithms took me some time and a lot of effort.
    Nowadays, I work as an AI engineer at [MobiDev](https://mobidev.biz/services/machine-learning-consulting),
    and the more experience I get, the more willing I am to share my experiences with
    people in my articles and webinars.'

    its impact on the reduction of AI-bias and harm. Her pioneering research, published
    in 2018/2019, showed how facial recognition software used by Amazon, Microsoft,
    IBM, and other companies was not “machine neutral.” It had a distinctly-lower
    performance when trying to recognize darker female faces as accurately as those
    of white men. [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90525023/most-creative-people-2020-joy-buolamwini)
    reported that the software was taken off the market for re-configuration based
    on Buolamwini’s research.

    AI Institute](https://hai.stanford.edu/). She developed [ImageNet](https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/),
    first published in 2009, as a training tool to teach AI how to identify objects.
    ImageNet was considered the birth of AI-dataset training, with the first tests
    achieving 71.8% accuracy. Since then, the annual ImageNet challenge is a contest
    to see which algorithm identifies objects with the lowest error rate. The last
    competition was held in 2017 when the winning algorithm hit 97.3% accuracy, which
    is better than human abilities.

    to deal with air contamination. Dangerous levels of air contamination are responsible
    for over four million deaths each year. The qAIRa company combines drone technology
    with air-quality monitoring, using data analytics to identify air contamination,

    of air-borne contaminants in an emergency, such as an industrial gas leak, natural
    disaster, or chemical spill. Another use for these AI-driven systems is to improve
    overall air quality by effectively monitoring targeted areas subject to air-pollution
    abatement initiatives.

    been a thought leader in this AI space. She was the first person to receive the
    $1 million prize for the AAAI Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for
    the Benefit of Humanity.

- en: Professor Barzilay is a strong advocate for having standards that ensure equity
    and fairness in applying AI technology, especially in medicine. As an example,
    she points to the Tyrer-Cuzick model used to determine a patient’s risk of getting
    breast cancer by analyzing imaging data. This system has a modest accuracy with
    white women but fails miserably with women of African or Asian descent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This failure happens because the software has not been adequately machine-trained
    on enough sets of images from racially-diverse groups. This problem is due to
    undesirable researcher-bias. It is readily proven and unconscionable. Professor
    Barzilay insists that software developers eliminate bias by validating AI software
    on different groups of people or by allowing it to be open source to compare system
    accuracy using diverse models.

    projects. Google partnered with conservation groups to use AI to study wildlife.
    Since the 1990s, the groups have collected 4.5 million photos of animals using
    camera traps. That database of images formed the initial image library for [Wildlife
    Insights](https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/). Others can add camera trap images
    to help map wildlife globally and to build the growing image database. Anyone
    can access the database online to [explore the photo](https://app.wildlifeinsights.org/explore)
    and the location maps of the camera traps.

    species, predator/prey interactions, and how wild animals respond to human hunting
