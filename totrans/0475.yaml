- en: Outside of the technology sector, banking and insurance are perhaps the biggest
    employers of data scientists. Given that financial services have always been dependent
    on data and models - for example, for loan approvals or insurance underwriting
    - this should not be surprising. As a data scientist, though, how do you decide
    if it is for you? What real-world problems will you be solving? What challenges
    can you expect? What does it take to succeed?

- en: One of the best things about a data scientist’s job in financial services is
    the sheer **richness of use cases and the real-world impact a data scientist can
    have**. Of course, there are all the usual applications common to any customer-facing
    business, such as personalised experiences, targeted cross-sell offers, or proactive
    strategies to prevent customer churn. But banks, insurers, and their fintech challengers
    use data and analytics in many other interesting and impactful ways.

- en: A second attraction for many data scientists will be the **breadth and depth
    of data sets** that can be made available to generate meaningful insights. Banks
    and insurers often have access to extensive data, such as demographics, transactions,
    and relationships, at both a macro-level and at the level of individual customers.
    Despite some restrictions on their use, the availability of high-quality data
    sets like these, often going back years, can be a data scientist’s dream when
    it comes to building predictive models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The size of financial services firms’ **spend on data and technology** and the
    **relative maturity of their data ecosystems** can also make them attractive for
    data scientists. For example, most banks spend more than 10% of their annual revenues
    on technology. Spending on data and analytics is an increasingly important component
    of that and can easily reach or exceed hundreds of millions per year for many
    of the larger players - a figure unmatched by all but the biggest in the technology
    sector. As a result of years of spending on data, many also have relatively mature
    data teams. As a result, data scientists might find well-established support systems
    in place and are not expected to manage everything from data pipelines to data
    governance all on their own.

- en: Lastly, in most geographies, banks, insurers, and fintechs are often **some
    of the best paymasters for data scientists**. While attractive in its own right,
    it is also a useful indicator of the value that is being placed on data science
    in these firms and the implications it can have for longer-term career tracks.
    In at least one major global bank, the Chief Data and Analytics Officer now reports
    directly to the Group CEO.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is, of course, a catch. Everything that makes it interesting to work as
    a data scientist in banks and insurers, particularly the bigger ones, can also
    make it unwieldy and frustrating at times. Some data scientists will view these
    purely as challenges; others might also view them as opportunities to develop
    themselves and have a greater impact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the high-stakes use of data and analytics in the industry, there is a
    **high bar of trust to prove that data and models are good enough for real-life
    use**. For example, if a data scientist is building a predictive model that could
    be used to deny somebody a loan or insurance cover, or mark someone as a potential
    money launderer, then they should probably expect a huge amount of scrutiny.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, given that customers often trust banks and insurers with the most
    intimate aspects of their life - for example, their income or their medical histories,
    data scientists can find **elaborate controls around data availability and usability**.
    Concerns around data privacy, sovereignty, ethics, and security exist in every
    industry, but very few other industries spend as much time and effort on managing
    them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Extensive spending on data and related technology, and well-resourced teams
    of data engineers, analysts, and risk specialists can provide fertile ground for
    data scientists to thrive. However, the same factors can also lead to **loss of
    agility** on a day-to-day basis. In many cases, these might translate into restrictive
    technology choices for data scientists or multi-step processes with elaborate
    controls and hand-offs before their work can actually see the light of day in
    production. One particular area that surprises new joiners to banking is the need
    to get all material models formally validated by an independent team - a step
    that can add weeks or even months to the normal model lifecycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Underpinning all of the above challenges is the fact that financial services
    are one of the most regulated industries worldwide. In response, most banks and
    insurers have built a **DNA of risk and compliance**, particularly after the 2008
    financial crisis. In many geographies, senior managers at banks and insurers bear
    personal accountability for the actions of their employers, so anything that holds
    the potential of breaching customer trust or regulatory requirements is treated
    with particular caution. The use of data and algorithms ticks all the boxes. Not
    surprisingly, financial regulators have been among the first to come out with
    guidelines around responsible use of data and AI - for example, in [Singapore](https://www.mas.gov.sg/~/media/MAS/News%20and%20Publications/Monographs%20and%20Information%20Papers/FEAT%20Principles%20Final.pdf),
    [Hong Kong](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/guidelines-and-circular/2019/20191101e1.pdf),
    the [European Union](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-publishes-report-artificial-intelligence-governance-principles_en),
    the [United Kingdom](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2020/dave-ramsden-opening-remarks-for-the-launch-of-aippf),
    and the [United States](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/03/31/2021-06607/request-for-information-and-comment-on-financial-institutions-use-of-artificial-intelligence).
