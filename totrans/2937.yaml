- en: In today’s world, every organization is working on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    driven transformation in some shape or form. The hype created by AI is very strong
    and organizations have atleast some hype (not high) profile team working on AI.
    However, the charm of AI fades within a short while, when organization/s realize
    that they have not been able to get the extremes of high-end AI and seemingly
    mundane business process meet, to deliver the bottom/top line metrics. The challenge
    is not in AI or business process individually, AI needs to understand business
    processes and the business processes need to be able to change to bring insight
    from AI into the process.![Organizations fail scaling AI Figure 1](../Images/a154069ff2b71980ef7a6eb2a475fc64.png)

    the team started. The important part here is to ensure that the team include members
    that have strong operational view and can translate the strategy to implementation
    in the organization.

    by calling the operator and requesting the closure of their account. Let’s say
    100 customers request cancellation monthly. The operator responds by providing
    a $50 discount for future bills and retains 50% the cancellation requests. Retention
    team works on a budget of 100*50%*50 = $2500 to retain customer. The P&L team
    gets a revenue of ARPU $60 for 50 customers for a year. Revenue retained = $60*50*12
    = $36000\. In achieving this the contact centre team made 2 calls per prospective
    churner, 2*100 = 200 calls.'

    and retaining them by taking a proactive action. The Data scientist team identifies
    120 customers likely to churn with 70% confidence (i.e 84 customer would have
    anyway requested for cancellation in future). The operator responds with the $50
    discount. The acceptance rate of the discount increases as the list includes people
    who would not have requested a churn. Thereby the retention budget goes up i.e
    120*60%*50 = $3600\. The revenue retained = $60*60*12 = $43200\. Calls made to
    achieve the objective, 2* 120 = 240.'

    winner with higher retained revenue ($43200 Vs $36000).

- en: The two supporting business processes, retention dept and the contact centre
    have to increase their capacity and budget. Also, the increase in cost comes before
    the improvement in revenue. This leads to a conflict of interest within the sub-organizations
    and the supporting departments don’t work in **alignment** for the overall business
    objective.

    challenge, as setting up a new process to include AI insights is huge change management
    process for the organization. The AI team would not have thought of requiring
    a **new process** to complete the execution.

    to spend most of their time. Getting the team aligned requires ability of the
    Data scientist to explain the results. Current day data scientist wok on the black
    box algorithm that provide higher accuracy, but the results are challenged in
    **explanatory power of AI**. The link to causality is an important requirement
    of getting team alignment. People will not act unless they understand in simple
    language they relate.

    business are very different. The POC requires a strong story teller and bringing
    the simplicity in the business problem. The implementation will require process
    changes across various stakeholders, connecting the various IT systems, the source
    data challenges, data completeness, process /data governance and policies adhered
    etc..

    such that from the very beginning the value of the program is understood in a
    common language, challenges of implementation identified - discussed - understood,
    skills aligned across the various phases of the project, and project delivered
    with agility.

    initiatives will be successful as the data/ insights might not be good enough.
    Executing with agility and sustainably also requires an understanding of ‘failing
    fast’. The objective is to succeed in driving AI as an organization initiative,
    even if it requires some projects to be shelved after quick evaluation.
