- en: Did you know approximately half of the AI models that are developed never actually
    make it into production? If you want to understand why and prevent the waste of
    data scientist time and other resources from happening at your organization, then
    it is important to understand the difference between MLOps and ModelOps. They
    aren’t the same, but the terms are often used interchangeably. That lack of understanding
    about the specific roles and value of MLOps and ModelOps undermines the value
    of enterprise AI programs. It is important to know the difference between MLOps
    and ModelOps because neither is a substitute for the other.

    because while both are needed, only one fully addresses the operational and governance
    process issues that are holding back nearly two-thirds of enterprise AI programs
    (the [2021 State of ModelOps Report](https://business-of-data.com/reports/state-of-modelops-2021/)).

    ML models during the data science process.   It is a feature of mature and maturing
    data science platforms like [Amazon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon/) Sagemaker, [Domino
    Data Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/domino-data-lab/), and [DataRobot](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datarobot/).

    in production that ensures independent validation and accountability of all models
    in production that enable business-impacting decisions no matter how those models
    are created.  ModelOps platforms like [ModelOp Center](http://www.modelop.com/)
    automate all aspects of model operations, regardless of the type of model, how
    developed, or where the model is run.

- en: MLOps tools and features are used for developing machine learning (ML) models. 
    It includes the actual coding of the ML model, testing, training, validation,
    and retraining.  Data Scientists are responsible for the model development, working
    closely with the DataOps and Data Analytics teams to identify the proper data
    and data sets for the model.  The Data Scientists are typically aligned with a
    line of business and remain focused on the goals of that particular business unit
    or a specific project.

    outcomes for any and all models in production.  It includes managing all aspects
    of models in production, such as inventorying models that are in production, ensuring
    production models are providing reliable decision-making, and adhering to all
    regulatory, compliance, and risk requirements and controls.  CIOs and IT Operations,
    working with lines of business, are responsible for establishing and implementing
    a ModelOps platform that meets the needs of the enterprise.

- en: MLOps and ModelOps are complementary solutions, not competitive ones. ModelOps
    solutions can’t build models, and MLOps can’t govern and manage production models
    throughout their lifecycle across the enterprise.
  prefs: []

- en: Some MLOps solutions offer limited management capabilities, but the limitations
    tend to become evident when enterprises begin to scale AI efforts and uniformly
    enforce risk and compliance controls.  Additionally, the “tried and true” practice
    of having checks and balances between development and production operations applies
    to every model that is developed and put in production.  History has shown that
    you can’t have “the students grading their own papers” or “the fox watching the
    hen house.”

- en: ModelOps platforms automate the risk, regulatory, and operational aspects of
    models and ensure that models can be audited and evaluated for technical conformance,
    business value, and business and operational risk.  By combining these enterprise
    capabilities with the efficiency of MLOps tools, enterprises can exploit the investment
    in their MLOps tools and build a foundational platform for accelerating, scaling,
    and governing AI across the enterprise.
