    and money to build, but they rarely make it into production. According to [VentureBeat
    AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/),
    87% of data science projects never make it into production. That’s a pretty high
    number! But why is it so high?

    there is a gray area of what the data science team needs to produce to ensure

    to data engineers, product managers, IT admin, and more. When working on a project,
    documenting everything you do provides everybody in the team with a clearer understanding
    of the process of the project, and what needs to be done next.

    One of the biggest challenges a lot of companies face is the multiple production

    should be able to see what data sources the data scientist used, the modeling

    The majority of data is stored as flat files or can be accessed through relational
    database systems. However, the biggest challenge that data science teams face
    is when members of the team download the raw data and produce their work locally
    without pushing the intermediate data versions back for other members of their
    team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, other members of the data science team will complete the same
    work, causing a repetition of workloads. Sharing your work is very valuable, as
    it gives your coworkers a chance to take advantage of the work you have done,
    so they can work from that.

    elements are connected in series, where the output of one element is the input
    of the next one. Rather than spending extra time running two or more commands
    to go from your raw data to your end result, using a data pipeline allows you
    to see the entire transformation with a single command.
