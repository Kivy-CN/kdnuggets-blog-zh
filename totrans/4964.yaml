    training program on Artificial Intelligence. In this blog we are going to describe
    the secrets behind the structure of the course so even if you aren’t ready to
    join this training – you can replicate these steps in your own learning program.

    With DQN we will be able to solve a more challenging problem: conquering the popular
    game of Breakout! For this challenge our inputs will be vectors of encoded values,
    all describing one state of the environment, that is: the coordinates of the position
    of the ball, the coordinates of the vector of direction where the ball is going,
    and maybe some binary values for each of the bricks being 1 if the brick is still
    there and 0 if not.'

    to a human playing the game. Since an encoded vector doesn’t preserve the spatial
    structure of an image, this is not the best form to describe a state. The spatial
    structure is indeed important because it gives us more information to predict
    the next state, and predicting the next state is, of course, essential for our
    AI to know what the right next move is. Therefore, we need to preserve the spatial
    structure and to do that, our inputs must be 3D images (2D for the array of pixels
    plus one additional dimension for the colors). In this case, the inputs are simply
    the images of the screen itself, identical to what a human sees when playing the
    game. Following this analogy, the AI acts like a human: it observes the input
    images of the screen when playing the game, the input images go into a convolutional
    neural network (the brain for a human) which will detect the state in each image,
    and then by predicting the next state thanks to Q-Learning, the AI/Human will
    predict the best action to play. And again, this action is the output of the neural
    network.'

    introduced by Google DeepMind last year. We would like to implement this AI for
    several driving cars running on a same map. We will train the cars to avoid themselves
    and to avoid obstacles. A pretty exciting challenge to end this AI journey!
