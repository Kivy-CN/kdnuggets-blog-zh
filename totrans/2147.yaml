    While large models like GPT-3 have grabbed headlines, small language models are
    also advantageous and accessible for various applications. In this article, we
    will explore the importance and use cases of small language models with all the
    implementation steps in detail.

    to set up your environment, which involves installing the necessary libraries
    and dependencies. Selecting the right frameworks and libraries to build a language
    model on your local CPU becomes crucial. Popular choices include Python-based
    libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. These frameworks provide many pre-built
    tools and resources for machine learning and deep learning-based applications.

    for local use. For a small language model, we can consider simpler architectures
    like LSTM or GRU, which are computationally less intensive than more complex models
    like transformers. You can also use pre-trained word embeddings to enhance your
    model's performance while reducing the training time. But for quick working, we

    for loading and working with models for causal language modeling.

- en: Small language models can be fine-tuned based on your specific needs. If you
    have to use these models in real-life applications, the main thing to remember
    is efficiency and scalability. So, to make the small language models efficient
    compared to large language models, you can adjust the context size and batching(partition
    data into smaller batches for faster computation), which also results in overcoming
    the scalability problem.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    need, you can choose the value of context size. In this example, we will set the
    value of this hyperparameter as 128 tokens.

    segments simultaneously, which can handle the queries parallely and help scale
    the application for a large set of users. But while deciding the batch size, you
    must carefully check your system's capabilities. Otherwise, your system can cause
    issues due to heavy load.
