    I firmly believe that I succeeded. I'm so sure about that because I received dozens
    of [positive feedback](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43190851-the-hundred-page-machine-learning-book).
    Both from readers who just start in artificial intelligence and from respected
    industry leaders.

    as **Peter Norvig** and **Aurélien Géron** endorsed my book and wrote the texts
    for its back cover and that **Gareth James** wrote the Foreword.

    textbook **AIMA**: "Burkov has undertaken a very useful but impossibly hard task
    in reducing all of machine learning to 100 pages. He succeeds well in choosing
    the topics — both theory and practice — that will be useful to practitioners,
    and for the reader who understands that this is the first 100 (or actually 150)
    pages you will read, not the last, provides a solid introduction to the field."'

    Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow**: "The breadth of topics the book covers
    is amazing for just 100 pages (plus few bonus pages!). Burkov doesn''t hesitate
    to go into the math equations: that''s one thing that short books usually drop.
    I really liked how the author explains the core concepts in just a few words.
    The book can be very useful for newcomers in the field, as well as for old-timers
    who can gain from such a broad view of the field."'
