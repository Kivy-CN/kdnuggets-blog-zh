    are sitting on humongous amounts of data and need to know how to organize, access,
    and manage the data. Hence, speed i.e. agility to access the data and working
    with the quality data have become the key enablers to keep an organization ahead
    of the competition.

    Further, we will learn how such tools can derive more meaningful insights when
    powered and fused with Business intelligence (BI) and Artificial Intelligence

    intelligence, and what is the difference between traditional and modern intelligence.
    Further, the article also briefly touches upon how BI is different from AI before
    elaborating on various benefits of being a data-first organization.

- en: It is the intelligence derived by managing and analyzing raw data and being
    able to generate actionable insights to help businesses take critical decisions.
    Put simply, it is a collection of data analytics tools to help leaders make informed
    business decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what kind of business decisions are driven by data? Well, almost all the
    decisions if your organization adopts data as a culture. Data-driven organizations
    do not rely on intuition or the number of years of experience. In the fast pace
    shift to digitalization, it is imperative to understand the customers’ changing
    dynamics by directly learning their preferences derived from the data.

    It gives the business users a more hands-free approach to visualizing the data
    and answering their questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditional BI solutions are more top-down i.e. the static reports answer certain
    questions for the business. In the case of follow-up questions, the process is
    repeated and goes through the multiple displeasing iterations of seeking the response
    from the analysts before being passed back to the business leaders. This slow
    and iterating reporting cycle blocks and weakens the business’ position to take
    timely decisions. As we highlighted the importance of speed at the outset of this
    article, such queued requests of follow-up queries lead to stale data and a competitive
    disadvantage for the business.

    to data, new data discovery and exploration, and effective information-sharing.
    Modern intelligence allows businesses to use analytics and respond to changing
    expectations, customize dashboards and create reports quickly. While IT teams
    continue to manage and secure the data access, seamless collaboration between
    business users and IT teams leads to a win-win situation for driving critical
    business decisions, faster.

    the AI solution also takes unstructured data as an input and transforms it into
    the machine-understandable data format.

    about what has happened and why? AI can extend beyond the past and is forward-looking
    i.e. it answers what is likely to happen in the future and what should a business
    do next?

    of which data resources will yield maximum value. When the leaders are tasked
    with identifying the projects with maximum ROI or high impact and value, data-driven
    insights help them prioritize projects leading to efficient utilization of time

    organization. The insights can be generated at an aggregated level or can be narrowed
    down to zoom in to a specific division of interest. It helps businesses identify
    their strengths and weaknesses and eventually design their roadmap accordingly.

    new customers, why a customer should choose their product, and how to improve
    it further to retain the customer base. Notably, the key to a successful business

    as part of its culture i.e. every employee (including top management and developers
    alike) is contributing to making data-driven decisions. Good quality data leads
    to high confidence decisions and effective business outcomes. To summarize, smart
    use of data sets up a business for success.
