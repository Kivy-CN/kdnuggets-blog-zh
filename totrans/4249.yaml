- en: After looking through some photos from a recent camping trip that I had taken
    a couple of weeks ago. I decided to take some of my old vacation photos, and turn
    them into a slideshow with some Python. Don’t worry I undertook this endeavor
    with the understanding that Google Photos, and the Apple equivalent do this really
    well already. This was really just intended to feed my addiction to building out
    side projects.

- en: When looking through the available options I stumbled across a paper with some
    code that would take your photos, and add a transition that applies a 3D Ken Burns
    Effect to your photos. The Ken Burns Effect gets the 3D aspect for free with video
    obviously, but is less compelling with photos due to that missing dimension. So
    in the following write up I am hoping to set you up to be able to try, and add
    this extra dimension to your photos as I was able to.

- en: Here are some concepts that are worth knowing due to their relevance in what
    we are looking to achieve. Though we don’t need to be aware of this the AI models
    are applying the 3D dimension to our Ken Burns effect by adding perspective through
    correctly scaling the size of the objects in the photo through estimating their
    depth. As the effect moves through the photo the model is required to reconstruct
    the missing objects, and textures that don’t appear in the 2D image through inpainting.

    and panning across photographs gives the feeling of motion. It’s named after an
    American documentarian who often used this effect. The writers of this paper have
    added the third dimension to this that would normally be missing from photos.'

    Mai](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Mai%2C+L), [Jimei Yang](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Yang%2C+J), [Feng
    Liu](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Liu%2C+F), have provided
    us with a [codebase](https://github.com/sniklaus/3d-ken-burns) that allows us
    to apply this effect to our photos with some pre-trained models. I have noticed
    that they don’t work well for photos with lots of sharp edges in the foreground,
    but yield pretty impressive results on a number of the photos that I have tested
    it with.

    scenes, but if you want to just blindly try it yourself at the end of this section
    I added all of the code that we will be going through to a Google Colab that you
    can copy, and use immediately.

    because in the code samples I go through I use some Colab specific functionality
    to help with ease of use.

    contains this implementation, and pre-tained models. So what happens below is
    we clone the repo, navigate to it, make our output directory, and install the
    required libraries. The Google Colab has a lot of the requirements already preloaded
    when you start a new runtime so there was just two that were missing.

    your source/image directory. You don’t really need to include this in your notebook
    to move forward, as you could just drag your files into their corresponding folders
    with the Colab interface, but it’s a pretty nice connivence cell.

    this applied effect in this post, so as with all of my efforts, please take advantage
    of this knowledge, and convert your mp4’s to animated gif’s as you please. As
    a bonus we have already imported `imageio` as a dependency so there’s no need
    to install it. Below we use this function, and iterate through the destination
    directory looking for mp4’s to convert.
