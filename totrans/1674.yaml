    To achieve this goal, we started by looking at and [ranking popular deep learning
    libraries for data science](http://testtdi.com/2017/10/ranking-popular-deep-learning-libraries-for-data-science/).
    Next, we wanted to analyze the popularity of distributed computing packages for

    are useful for Data Science, based on Github and Stack Overflow activity, as well
    as Google Search results. The table shows standardized scores, where a value of
    1 means one standard deviation above average (average = score of 0). For example,
    *Apache Hadoop* is 6.6 standard deviations above average in Stack Overflow activity,
    while *Apache Flink* is close to average. See below for methods.

    (stars and forks), Stack Overflow (tags and questions), and number of Google search
    results. These were obtained using available APIs. Coming up with a comprehensive
    list of distributed computing packages was tricky - in the end, we scraped three
    different lists that we thought were representative. We chose to focus on 140
    frameworks and distributed programing packages (see methods below for details).
    Computing standardized scores for each metric allows us to see which packages
    stand out in each category. The [full ranking is here](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/output/DL_libraries_final_Rankings.csv),
    while the [raw data is here](https://github.com/thedataincubator/data-science-blogs/blob/master/output/distributed_computing_data.csv).'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apache Spark (1) is an incredibly popular open source distributed computing
    framework. Apache Spark dominated the Github activity metric with its numbers
    of forks and stars more than eight standard deviations above the mean. Apache
    Spark utilizes in-memory data processing, which makes it faster than its predecessors
    and capable of machine learning. It also offers an interactive console in either
    Scala or, more popular among data scientists, Python. Although Apache Spark was
    initially designed for the Hadoop ecosystem, it can run on its own using one of
    many different file management systems. Apache Hadoop (2) outperformed Apache
    Spark in Stack Overflow activity. The disconnect between Hadoop's Stack Overflow
    activity and the other two metrics is likely due to the fact that the meaning
    of Apache Hadoop has evolved over time. Rather than referring to just the framework,
    the term "Hadoop" can also mean all Hadoop-related projects that make up the ecosystem.
    This results in a somewhat inflated Stack Overflow score. Nevertheless, most of
    the frameworks and engines on our list have Apache Hadoop integrations. And it
    measured at least two standard deviations above the mean on all our metrics, solidifying
    its number two spot.

    for streaming**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apache Storm (4), initially touted as the Apache Hadoop of real-time, is a stream-only
    framework best for near real-time distributed computing. It performed above average
    on all of our metrics. While Apache Storm processes stream data at scale, it is
    frequently used with Apache Kafka (3), a platform that processes the raw messages
    from real-time data feeds at scale. Similar to Apache Spark, Apache Flink (8)
    is also a framework capable of both batch and stream processing. However, Apache
    Spark bills itself as a batch-processor that can handle streaming, while Apache
    Flink is suited for heavy stream processing with some batch tasks.

    a unified way to access to multiple datastores.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    datastores with different natures, like Apache Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Arvo,
    or MongoDB. The number of Google search results for Stratio Crossdata have increased
    by 400% from the last quarter, which is the largest growth rate out of all 140
    packages on our list.

- en: The most popular of the two Twitter projects on our list, Apache Storm (4),
    was donated to the Apache Software Foundation by Twitter in 2011\. Twitter Heron
    (9) is a direct successor to Apache Storm released in June 2016\. Twitter Heron
    offers improved real-time, fault-tolerant stream processing with higher throughput
    than Storm. Twitter Heron had the fifth largest quarterly growth rate with an
    increase of 180%. It will be interesting to see if Twitter Heron can climb farther
    up the ranks with time.

    computing frameworks and interfaces. 17 of the top 20 packages we ranked are part
    of the Hadoop Ecosystem or designed to integrate with Apache Spark or Apache Hadoop
    (including HDFS). Outside of the Hadoop Ecosystem Hazelcast (10), an in-memory
    data grid, Google BigQuery (12), cloud-based big data analytics web service using
    a SQL-like syntax, and Metamarkets Druid (15) a framework for real-time analysis
    of large datasets performed well on our metrics.

    [sources](http://bigdata.andreamostosi.name/), and then collected metrics for
    all of them, to come up with an index value that was used for the ranking. "Github"
    index scores are based on both stars and forks, "Stack Overflow" index scores
    are based on tags and questions containing the package name, and "Search Results"
    are based on total number of Google search results over the last five years and
    the quarterly growth rate of results calculated over the past three months as
    compared to the prior three months. The number of Google search results data was
    chosen as a metric over Google Trends data, as the amount of websites indexed
    for a particular keyword(s) is a more reliable indicator of popularity of use
    of that package than the amount of people searching for that keyword(s). The calculations
    for this index ranking can be found in the source code here.
