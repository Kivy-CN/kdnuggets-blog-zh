    courses and an outdated college Intro to SQL course, he’d managed to bag a six-figure
    job in data science. Nowadays, most people struggling to get a good data science
    job will agree that’s unlikely to happen. Does that mean the data science job
    category is a popped bubble – or worse, that it hasn’t yet burst, but is about
    to?
  prefs: []

    field, easy to get into if you used the right keywords on your resume. Nowadays,
    employers are a little more discerning and often have specific skill sets in mind
    that they’re looking for.

- en: The bootcamps, free courses, and ‘Hello World’ projects don’t cut it anymore.
    You need to prove specific expertise and nail your data science interview, not
    just drop buzzwords. Not only that, but the shine of “data scientist” has worn
    off a little. For a long time, it was the sexiest job out there. Now? Other fields,
    like AI and machine learning, are just a bit sexier.

    will be a 35 percent change in employment from 2022 to 2032 for data scientists.
    In short, in 2032, there will be about a third more jobs in data science than
    there were in 2022\. For comparison, the average growth rate for all jobs is 3
    percent. Keep that number in mind as you go through the rest of this article.

    data science.

    through 2024, the tech sector in general [experienced](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/tech-layoffs-2023-list/)
    430k layoffs. It’s difficult to tease out data science-specific data from those
    numbers, but the best guesses are that around 30 percent of those were in data
    science and engineering.

    scope than that – it’s a *pandemic* bubble popping. In 2020, as more people stayed
    home, profits rose, and money was cheap, FAANG and FAANG-adjacent companies scooped
    up record numbers of tech workers, only to lay many of them off just a few years
    later.

    an anti-remote, anti-tech backlash happening at the moment. Meta, Google, and
    other FAANG companies, spooked by the bargaining power that employees enjoyed
    during the pandemic heights, are now pushing for return-to-office mandates (data
    science jobs and other tech jobs are often remote) and laying off large quantities
    of employees somewhat unnecessarily, judging by their revenue and profit reports.

- en: Back in 2011, Harvard Business Review famously called it the sexiest job of
    the decade. In the intervening years, companies hired more “data scientists” than
    they knew what to do with, often unsure about what data scientists actually did.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, a decade and a half later, the field is a little wiser. Employers understand
    that data science is a broad field, and are more interested in hiring machine
    learning specialists, data pipeline engineers, cloud engineers, statisticians,
    and other specialties that broadly fall under the data science hat but are more
    specialized.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This also helps explain why this idea of walking into six figure job straight
    out of a bachelor's degree used to be the case - since employers didn't know better
    - but now is impossible to do. The lack of “easy” data science jobs makes it feel
    like the market is tighter. It's not; data shows job openings are still high and
    demand is still greater than the graduates coming out with appropriate degrees.
    But employers are more discerning and unwilling to take a chance on untried college
    grads with no demonstrated experience.

    basic understanding of data tools, catapulted himself into a lucrative career.
    Things aren’t like that anymore, but this recalibration isn’t a sign of a bursting
    bubble as some believe. Instead, it’s the field of data science maturing. The
    entry-level data science field may be oversaturated, but for those with specialized
    skills, deep knowledge, and practical experience, the field is wide open.'

    what a bubble actually represents. A bubble occurs when the value of something
    (in this case, a career sector) is driven by speculation rather than actual intrinsic
    worth. However, as we covered, the value proposition of data science is tangible
    and measurable. Companies need data scientists, plain and simple. There’s no speculation
    there.

    While these layoffs are significant, they reflect broader market forces rather
    than a fundamental flaw in the data science discipline. Don’t get caught up in
    the headlines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, it’s also worth noting that the perception of a bubble may stem from
    how data science itself is changing. As the field matures, the differentiation
    between roles becomes more pronounced. [Job titles](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/14-different-data-science-job-titles/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+ds+a+bubble+waiting+to+burst)
    like data engineering, data analysis, business intelligence, machine learning
    engineering, and data science are more specific, and require a more niche skill
    set.  This evolution can make the data science job market appear more volatile
    than it is, but in reality, companies just have a better understanding of their
    data science needs and can recruit for their specialities.

    actually in a bubble. The best thing you can do is, as I’ve indicated, pick your
    specialty and develop your skills in that area. Data science is a broad field,
    spilling over into different industries, languages, job titles, responsibilities,
    and seniorities. Select a specialty, train the skills, prep for the interview,
    and secure the job.
