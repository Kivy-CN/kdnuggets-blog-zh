    was a well-received piece on 5 lesser-known machine learning projects in the Python
    ecosystem, and included deep learning libraries, along with auxiliary support,
    data cleaning, and automation tools. As such, we thought it may be worth doing
    a follow-up post, but broadening our scope this time.

    heard of. This time, however, the projects will include those from across a number
    of different ecosystems and programming languages, as opposed to focusing solely
    on Python tools. You may find that, even if you have no requirement for any of
    these particular tools, inspecting their broad implementation details or their
    specific code may help in generating some ideas of your own. Like the previous
    iteration, there is no formal criteria for inclusion beyond projects that have
    caught my eye over time spent online, and the projects have Github repositories.
    Subjective, to be sure.

- en: scikit-image is image processing in Python for SciPy. Is scikit-image, itself,
    machine learning? Well, remember that this is a list of machine learning projects
    (nothing actually says they *must* perform machine learning), and recall that
    the previous post included support projects as well, such as data processing and
    preparation tools. scikit-image falls into this category. The project includes
    a number of image processing algorithms, such as point detection, filters, feature
    selection, and morphology.

    plays a huge role. Before extracting features from an image, it's extremely useful
    to be able to augment it so that aspects which are important to the machine learning

    implements the familiar Scikit-learn Fit/Predict interface, enabling fast estimator
    testing and swapping. It also allows for a smooth transition, and enables dedicated

    what you're after.
