    using Python and libraries like Pandas. While both cuDF and Pandas offer similar
    APIs for data manipulation, there are specific types of problems in which cuDF
    can provide significant performance improvements over Pandas, including large
    scale datasets, data preprocessing and engineering, real-time analytics, and,
    of course, parallel processing. The bigger the dataset, the greater the performance
    benefits.

    has been replaced by MATCH. FROM and JOIN have been discarded. But the WHERE and
    ORDER BY commands are used in the same way. Aggregate functions like SUM and AVG
    are all there, but the GROUP BY has been discarded. Most importantly, though,
    we gain the ability to query patterns in the graph using the node relationships.
    In the attached Cheat Sheet, you will see a list of most-commonly used query approaches.
