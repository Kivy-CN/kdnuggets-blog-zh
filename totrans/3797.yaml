    more people entering the industry everyday. However, it is a competitive industry.
    In order to continuously improve yourself, skill-set and increase your salary
    - you need to prove that you are a proficient programmer. One way you can do this
    is by learning the things that people don’t typically know.

    a variable data type which represents real numbers as an approximation. A floating-point
    number is a number in which the position of the decimal point can move around
    or "float" instead of being in a fixed position. This allows developers to make
    a trade-off between range and precision.

  zh: 进一步了解数字，我们有浮点数。浮点数是一种表示实数近似值的变量数据类型。浮点数是小数点位置可以移动或“浮动”的数字，而不是固定在一个位置。这允许开发人员在范围和精度之间进行权衡。
- en: But why an approximation? Computers only have a limited amount of space, either
    32 bits (single precision) or 64 bits (double precision). 64 bit is the default
    for programming languages such as Python and JavaScript. An example of floating-point
    numbers are 1.29, 87.565, and 9038724.2\. It can either be a positive or negative
    whole number with a decimal point.

- en: The base number is a mathematical object that needs to be multiplied by itself.
    The exponent is a number that identifies how many times a base number needs to
    be multiplied by itself. Therefore, a logarithm is an exponent which indicates
