    language processing. Their use-cases range from chatbots and virtual assistants
    to content generation and translation services. However, they have become one
    of the fastest-growing fields in the tech world - and we can find them all over
    the place.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Inference is the process where a trained language model, like GPT-3, generates
    responses to prompts or questions in real-world applications (like a chatbot).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a critical stage where models are put to the test, generating predictions
    and responses in practical scenarios. For big LLMs like GPT-3, the computational
    demands are enormous, making optimization during inference essential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider a model like GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters, equivalent to
    700GB of float32 data. This size, coupled with activation requirements, necessitates
    significant RAM. This is why Running GPT-3 without optimization would require
    an extensive setup.

    high-precision variables to lower-precision ones. This means we can reduce the
    32-bit floating-point numbers to lower precision formats like 16-bit or 8-bit,
    which are more memory-efficient. This can drastically reduce the memory footprint
    and improve inference speed.

    the student model to mimic the teacher's predictions, using a combination of the
    teacher's output logits and the true labels. By doing so, we can a achieve similar
    performance with a fraction of the resource requirement.
