- en: The acquisition and labeling of training data remains one of the major challenges
    for the mainstream adoption of machine learning solutions. Within the machine
    learning research community, several efforts such as weakly supervised learning
    or one-shot learning have been created in order to address this issue. Microsoft
    Research recently incubated a group called Minimum Data AI to work on different
    solutions for machine learning models that can operate without the need of large
    training datasets. Recently, [that group published a paper unveiling Icebreaker](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9621-icebreaker-element-wise-efficient-information-acquisition-with-a-bayesian-deep-latent-gaussian-model),
    a framework for “wise training data acquisition” which allow the deployment of
    machine learning models that can operate with little or no-training data.

- en: The current evolution of machine learning research and technologies have prioritized
    supervised models that need to know quite a bit about the world before they can
    produce any relevant knowledge. In real world scenarios, the acquisition and maintenance
    of high quality training datasets results quite challenging and sometimes impossible.
    In machine learning theory, we refer to this dilemma as the ice(cold)-start problem.

- en: The ice-start problem/dilemma refers to the amount of training data required
    to make machine learning models effective. Technically, most machine learning
    agents need to start with a large volume training dataset and start regularly
    decreasing its size during subsequent training runs until the model has achieved
    a desired level of accuracy. The ice-start challenge refers to the ability of
    the model to operate effectively in the absence of a training dataset.

- en: The solution to the ice-start problem can be described using the popular phrase
    “knowing what you don’t know”. In many situations in life, understanding the missing
    knowledge in a current context has proven to be equally or more important than
    the existing knowledge. Statistic nerds often refer to a famous anecdote of World
    War II to illustrate this dilemma.

- en: During World War II, the Pentagon assembled a team of the country’s most renown
    mathematicians in order to develop statistical models that could assist the allied
    troops during the war. The talent was astonishing. Frederick Mosteller, who would
    later found Harvard’s statistics department, was there. So was Leonard Jimmie
    Savage, the pioneer of decision theory and great advocate of the field that came
    to be called Bayesian statistics. Norbert Wiener, the MIT mathematician and the
    creator of cybernetics and Milton Friedman, future Nobel prize winner in economics
    were also part of the group. One of the first assignments of the group consisted
    of estimating the level of extra protection that should be added to US planes
    in order to survive the battles with the German air force. Like good statisticians,
    the team collected the damage caused to planes returning from encounters with
    the Nazis.

- en: For each plane, the mathematicians computed the number o bullet holes across
    different parts of the plane (doors, wings, motor, etc). The group then proceeded
    to make recommendations about which areas of the planes should have additional
    protection. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of the recommendations focused
    on the areas with that had more bullet holes assuming that those were the areas
    targeted by the German planes. There was one exception in the group, a young statistician
    named[ Abraham Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald?source=post_page---------------------------) who
    recommended to focus the extra protection in the areas that hadn’t shown any damage
    in the inventoried planes. Why? very simply, the young mathematician argued that
    the input data set( planes) only included planes that have survived the battles
    with the Germans. Although severe, the damage suffered by those planes was not
    catastrophic enough that they couldn’t return to base. therefore, he concluded
    that the planes that didn’t return were likely to have suffered impacts in other
    areas. Very clever huh?

- en: What this lesson teaches us is that understanding the missing data in a given
    context is as important as understanding the existing data. Extrapolating that
    to machine learning models, *the key to address the ice-start problem is to have
    a scalable model that knows what it does not know, namely to quantify the epistemic
    uncertainty. This knowledge can be used to guide the acquisition of training data.
    Intuitively, unfamiliar, but informative features are more useful for model training.*

- en: Microsoft Icebreaker is a novel solution to part of the ice-start challenge.
    Conceptually, Icebreaker relies on deep generative model that minimizes the amount
    and cost of data required to train a machine learning model. From an architecture
    standpoint, Icebreaker employs two components. The first component is a deep generative
    model (PA-BELGAM), shown in the top half of the model above, which features a
    novel inference algorithm that can explicitly quantify epistemic uncertainty.
    The second component is a set of new element-wise training data selection objectives
    for data acquisition, shown in the bottom half of the model.

- en: The core of Icebreaker is the PA-BELGAM model. This model is based on a version
    of a variational autoencoder that is able to manage missing elements and decoder
    weights. Instead of using a standard deep neural network as the decoder to map
    data from a latent representation, Icebreaker uses a Bayesian neural network,
    and we put a prior distribution over the decoder weights.

    The model showed relevant improvements compared to state of the art models as
    shown in the following figure. The chart on the left that Icebreaker performs
    better than several baselines, achieving better test accuracy with less training
    data. The graph on the right shows the number of data points for eight features
    as the total size of our data set grows.

    learning models that operate with little or no-data. By leveraging novel statistical
    methods, Icebreaker is able to select the right features for a given model without
    requiring a large dataset. [Microsoft Research open sourced an early version of
