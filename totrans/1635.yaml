    a certificate on Udemy or Coursera and you're set! It's also common knowledge
    that data science is hard - after all, a solid grounding in statistics and agnostic
    programming skills don't come easy - not to mention the need to round it out with
    a good dose of business acumen. It doesn't quite add up...

    credibility of chartered candidates, companies can now be safe in the knowledge
    that their data scientists are the real deal.

    an accountant or actuary who isn''t a member of a professional body (in most cases),
    and you wouldn''t want to. The Institute of Chartered Accountants (for example),
    the Actuaries Institute and countless others have rigorous qualification criteria
    and require members to uphold professional and ethical standards. An Association
    of Data Science Professionals can provide the same guarantees.'

    there are some courses that also focus on communication, but the fact remains
    that data science is an applied discipline, and is learnt best by doing. The above reasons
    are why aspiring data scientists are encouraged to share their work online (via
    blog, github, kaggle, etc) - it's a far stronger signal than a degree or an accreditation.

    with wildly varied backgrounds. Conforming to a homogeneous syllabus could limit
    the ability for certain areas and applications to reach their potential.

    requirement for such a body. Certainly, there are other industry groups that have
    no such requirement, but few could argue that membership of such a group provides
    much of a signal. The field is far too large for any operator to hope to license members
    with any objectivity apart from standardised testing, and thus we are drawn to
    this mechanism as a foundational plinth.

- en: You could argue that the reasons provided above are just a feature of the youthfulness of
    the profession. Certainly, as data science matures many of the methods used commonly
    today will be seen as standard practice. The pace of innovation in certain areas
    will undoubtedly plateau. But the "data scientist" of the future will have quite
    a different skillset to data scientists today. What we now call data science will
    splinter into various sub-fields, each with its own set of standards and archetypes.
    Perhaps some of these may be well-suited to institutional representation. Today
    - not so much.**Bio:** [Anthony Tockar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-tockar-474a7252/)
