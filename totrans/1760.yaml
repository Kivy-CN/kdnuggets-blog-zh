    recent technical subjects (deep learning or big data architectures) have almost
    standard course outlines and linearized storylines. On the other hand, **teaching
    support for the data science *process* has been elusive**, even though the [outlines
    of the process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Industry_Standard_Process_for_Data_Mining)
    have been around since the 90s. Understanding the process requires not only wide
    technical background in machine learning but also basic notions of businesses
    administration. I have elaborated on the organizational difficulties of data science
    transformation stemming from these complexities in a [previous essay](https://medium.com/@balazskegl/the-data-science-ecosystem-industrial-edition-938582427466);
    here I will share my experience on teaching the data science process.

    students participated in five RAMPs, designed to **challenge them on different
    scientific workflows and on different data science problems**. To learn workflow
    design, I covered a couple of **data-driven business cases**, gave students a

    was originally designed for a **collaborative prototyping** tool that makes efficient
    use of the time of data scientists in solving the data analytics segment of domain
    science or business problems. We then realized very soon that it is equally **valuable
    for training novice data scientists**. The main design feature we needed to change
    was complete openness. To be able to grade students based on individual performance,
    we needed to close the leaderboard. In the closed phase students see each other’s
    scores but not each other’s codes. We grade them using a capped linear function
    of their score. This typically 1–2 week long closed phase is followed by a “classical”
    open RAMP in which we grade students based on their activities and their ability
    of generating diversity and improving their own closed phase score.

    In all five RAMPs they beat not only the baseline but also the single day hackaton

    scientists and domain scientists participating.

    the main roadblock in non-IT companies launching data science projects is not
    lack of well-prepared data, not the infrastructure, not even the lack of trained
    data scientists, but the **lack of a well-defined data-driven business cases**.
    Worse: this problem is usually discovered *after* the initial investments into
    the data lake, the Hadoop server, and the data science team. A well prepared data
    (process) scientist who can go early into this transition and turn the project
