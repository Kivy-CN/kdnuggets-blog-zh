    today, for me at least, is not at the bleeding-edge of deep learning or reinforcement
    learning. Rather it has more to do with how models are managed and how data scientists
    and data engineers effectively collaborate as teams. Navigating those waters will
    lead organisations towards a more effective and sustainable application of ML.

    Andy Konwinski, Co-founder and VP of Product at Databricks, along with others,
    point to some key hurdles in a recent blog post about [MLFlow](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/03/06/managed-mlflow-on-databricks-now-in-public-preview.html).
    “Building production machine learning applications is challenging because there
    is no standard way to record experiments, ensure reproducible runs, and manage
    and deploy models,” says Databricks.

- en: The genesis of many major challenges in applying ML today — whether that be
    technical, commercial, or societal — is the imbalance of data over time coupled
    with the management, as well as utilisation, of ML artifacts. A model can perform
    exceptionally well, but if the underlying data drifts and artifacts are not being
    used to assess performance, your model will not generalise well nor update appropriately.
    This problem falls into a gray area that is inhabited by both data scientists
    and engineers.

    missing in ML. It doesn’t matter if you can create a really good ‘black box’ model
    if your environment changes, such as input data, and the model isn’t regularly
    assessed in the context of what it was built to do causing it to lose its relevance
    and value over time. This is an issue that’s hard to tackle because the people
    that are feeding the data in, engineers, and the people that designed the model,
    scientists, don’t have the happiest of marriages.

    there have been some large [missteps](https://medium.com/syncedreview/2018-in-review-10-ai-failures-c18faadf5983),
    which I would argue generally have origins in the gray area between data science
    and engineering.

    and slightly less commercial, examples include the [electricityMap](https://www.electricitymap.org/),
    which uses ML to map the environmental impact of electricity all over the world;
    ML in cancer research is currently helping us to detect several cancer types earlier
    and more accurately; AI-driven sensors powering [Agriculture](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2019/02/07/4-ways-artificial-intelligence-will-drive-digital-transformation-in-agriculture/#75ac0fbb1273) towards

    model management right. However, coming back to the point, data scientists and
    data engineers don’t always speak the same language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is not uncommon for a data scientist to lack an understanding of how their
    models should live in an environment that continuously ingests new data, integrates
    new code, is called by end-users, and can fail in a variety of ways from time
    to time (i.e., a production environment). On the other side of the divide, many
    data engineers do not understand enough about machine learning to understand what
    they are putting into production and the ramifications for the organisation.

    one another despite the fact that they occupy the same space. “That’s not my job”
    is not the right approach. To produce something that is reliable, sustainable,
    and adaptable, both roles must work together more effectively.

    — to have some kind of standardisation of the semantics, and therefore how the
    challenge is, or tangential challenges are, discussed. Naturally, this is fraught
    with challenges — just ask several different people what a data lake is, and you’re
    likely to get at least two different answers, if not more.

    which are too often considered separately. Whilst it may seem like introducing
    a holistic framework like this would increase complexity and interdependency —
    in practice, those complexities and interdependencies already exist — and ignoring
    them is just kicking a problem down the line.

    to operate a data science and engineering team for the purpose of deploying models
    to end-users. There is naturally a more technical and detailed understanding —
    I call that a ProductionML Framework (some might call this Continous Intelligence).

    meant to guide the future development of ProductionML projects, particularly the
    aspects of production ML that require input from both data scientists and engineers.

    and the Govern mechanism are centrally situated in this architecture. That is
    because every artifact, including metrics, parameters, and graphs, must be archived
    during the training and testing stages. Moreover, what is called Model Management
    is fundamentally tied to how the model is governed, which leverages those model
    artifacts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Governmechanism combines artifacts and business rules to promote the appropriate
    model, or estimator to be more specific, to production while labeling others according
    to rules specific to the use case. This is also called model versioning, but the
    term ‘govern’ is used to avoid confusion with *version control* and emphasise
    the central role that the mechanism plays in overseeing model management.

    around model management and artifact archiving. Other products similarly address
    relatively specific issues — albeit their strengths may be in other parts of the
    ProductionML Value Chain. This can be seen in the Google Cloud ML Engine and AWS
    Sagemaker. Recently, the beta version of AutoML Tables beta was made available
    by GCP but even that does not deliver everything required out of the box, albeit
    does come much closer.
