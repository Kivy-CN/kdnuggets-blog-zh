    realized that **‘absolute definitions’** of data science require a lot of ‘data
    science’ background to be understood, which is a recursive problem... The hypothesis
    here is that statisticians or programmers understand what data science is much
    easier than, say historians or linguists, as the former have been exposed to data
    science in one form or another.

    of *Business* and *Data,* currently represented as the purple area in the picture.
    That’s because ‘Preliminary data report(ing)’, ‘Reporting with visuals’, ‘Creating
    dashboards’, and ‘Sales Forecasting’ are all **data-driven business activities.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    those are within *Business* but are based on past knowledge, experience, and behavior.
    All are important but as you will see shortly –not really data science.

    analytics process. Broadly, ‘Qualitative analytics’ is the use of your intuition

    future.

    and immediately business analytics but are data analytics. For instance, ‘Optimization
    of Drilling Operations’ requires data science tools and techniques. Data scientists
    may well do that on a daily basis. However, while in the domain of ‘oil **business**’
    we can’t really say that it is directly related to*Business Analytics*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    ‘Digital signal processing’ is an example of an activity that is part of *Data
    Analytics*, but is not *Data Science*, nor *Business Analytics*. Data, programing,
    and mathematics come into play, but not in the same way we would employ them in
    *Data Science*.
