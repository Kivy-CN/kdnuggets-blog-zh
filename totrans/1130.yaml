    said Rikin Kachhia, Software Engineer at Hasura. “Our systems deal with sensitive
    data and we didn’t want to get into compliance issues or send data to third parties.
    PostHog took that entire problem away by enabling us to deploy and maintain it
    ourselves.”

    be used by anyone at the company, even if they’d never used data science or analytics
    platforms before. Hasura’s UI and UX teams, for example, were able to run their
    own queries and discover actionable data on their own — freeing up other teams
    to spend less time supporting them.

    Initially, the team wanted just to understand the overall conversion rate, which
    they accomplished by building a funnel analysis in PostHog. Quickly, the team
    was able to identify specific areas where the funnel could be improved.

    flows,” said Kachhia. “As a result, we took several actions, such as moving these
    steps further down the funnel.”

    engaged when tackling them. As a result of these changes, This meant users weren’t
    hitting the most challenging areas of our funnel first. These changes helped us
    deliver a 10-20% improvement in our conversion rate.”

    use it across the board,” said Kachhia. “All of our blogs, our website, our product...everything
    plugs directly into PostHog so we can get the data we need to continue making
    improvements.”
