    Regularly faced with applying machine learning at massive levels of scalability,
    the LinkedIn engineering team has become a regular contributor to open source
    machine learning stacks as well as content that details some of the best practices
    learned in their machine learning journey. At the heart of the LinkedIn experience,
    we have the content feed that recommends new connections, jobs or candidates for
    a position. That content feed is powered by many recommendation systems based
    on machine learning models that need constant experimentation, versioning and
    evaluation. Those goals depend on a very robust feature engineering process. Recently,
    LinkedIn unveiled some details about their approach to feature engineering to
    enable rapid experimentation which contains some very unique innovations.

    deals with results incomprehensible for data scientists. Building an maintaining
    a single, effective machine learning models is hard enough so imagine coordinating
    the execution of thousands of machine learning programs to achieve a cohesive
    experience. Feature engineering is one of the key element to allow rapid experimentation
    of machine learning programs. For instance, let’s assume that a LinkedIn member
    is described using 100 features and that the content feed rendered in the member’s
    homepage is powered by 50+ machine learning models. Assuming that every second,
    there are tens of thousands of people loading their LinkedIn pages, the number
    of feature computations required is something like the following:'

    machine learning models) > 100 X 10000 X 50 > 50,000,000 per second*'

- en: That number is just unfathomable to most organizations starting their machine
    learning journey. Such a scale requires representing features in a flexible and
    easy to interpret manner that can be reused across different infrastructures such
    as Spark, Hadoop, database systems and others. The latest version of LinkedIn’s
    feature architecture introduces the concept of typed features to represent features
    in an expressive and reusable format. This idea arose from challenges with the
    previous version of LinkedIn’s machine learning inference and training architecture.

    evolved across different disparate infrastructures. For instance, the following
    figure represents the feature architecture for LinkedIn’s online and offline inference
    infrastructures based on Spark and Hadoop respectively.

- en: The online feature architecture was optimized for universality representing
    strings to store categoricals and a single value type of floats. This design incurred
    an efficiency cost in representing integer counts, categoricals with known domains,
    and interacted features. On the other hand, the HDFS feature snapshot was optimized
    for simple offline joins, was specific per feature rather than uniform, and did
    not take into account online systems. The constant translation between the different
    types of feature representations introduced regular friction in the possible experimentation
    with features and challenges replicating updates across the different systems.

- en: To address some of the limitations of the initial feature architecture, LinkedIn
    introduced a new way of storing features throughout our systems in a single format
    of tensors with feature-specific metadata. Tensors are a standard computation
    unit used across most of the popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow
    or PyTorch. From that perspective, the use of tensors facilitate the implementation
    of complex linear algebra operations without sacrificing the underlying format.
    Most data scientists are familiar with the tensor structure so the new representation
    results relatively easy to incorporate in machine learning programs.

- en: One thing that is important to notice is that the new LinkedIn structure is
    designed specifically for features and not relying on a generic data type format
    like Avro. By building on top of tensors, features are always serialized in the
    same generic schema. This allows for flexibility in quickly adding new features
    to systems without changing any APIs. This is achievable thanks to the metadata,
    which maps what previously would have been space-inefficient strings or custom-defined
    schemas to integers.

- en: The following code illustrates the definition of a feature using LinkedIn’s
    new typed feature schema. Concretely, defines a feature “historicalActionsInFeed”
    that will list historical actions a member has taken on the feed. The feature
    metadata information is defined inside the flagship namespace, with names and
    versions. This allows for any system to look up the feature in the metadata system
    using the urn *urn:li:(flagship,historicalActionsInFeed,1,0).* From this feature
    definition, there are two important dimensions, which include a categorical listing
    of different action types in *“feedActions”* as well as a discrete count representing
    different time windows in a member’s history.

- en: Having a new feature and metadata representation model in place makes distribution
    the new challenge. How to effectively distribute new features across thousands
    of machine learning models and dozens of infrastructure components. The answer
    was simpler than expected. LinkedIn created a single, textual source of truth
    for each metadata type that is stored under source control and published as an
    artifact library. How clever! Any machine learning system can pull the desired
    metadata constructs by simply declaring a dependency. Additionally, the LinkedIn
    typed feature solution includes a metadata resolution library that operates against
    different feature stores.

- en: LinkedIn new type feature architecture includes some interesting ideas that
    can streamline feature engineering for large scale machine learning systems. By
    using tensors are the underlying computation unit, Linked has created a feature
    representation that is easily pluggable into any machine learning frameworks.
    Additionally, the use of metadata can enrich the representation of the feature.
    Early reports indicate that the new typed feature architecture has increased the
    performance of LinkedIn’s inference systems for over 20% which is a remarkable
    number at that scale. It would be interesting to see some of these ideas open
    sourced in the near future.
