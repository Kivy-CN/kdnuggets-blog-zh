    are other unsupervised processes, among which clustering stands out. This article
    introduces clustering and cluster analysis, highlighting the potential of cluster
    analysis for segmenting, analyzing, and gaining insights from groups of similar
    data

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, clustering is a synonym for **grouping together similar data
    items**. This could be like organizing and placing similar fruits and vegetables
    close to each other in a grocery store.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let''s elaborate on this concept further: clustering is a form of **unsupervised
    learning** task: a broad family of machine learning approaches where data are
    assumed to be unlabeled or uncategorized a priori, and the aim is to discover
    patterns or insights underlying them. Specifically, the purpose of clustering
    is to discover groups of data observations with *similar* characteristics or properties.'

    in a supermarket with similar shopping behavior, or grouping a large body of products
    in an e-commerce portal into categories or similar items. These are common examples
    of real-world scenarios involving clustering processes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Iterative clustering**: these algorithms iteratively assign (and sometimes
    reassign) data points to their respective clusters until they converge towards
    a "good enough" solution. The most popular iterative clustering algorithm is **k-means, **which
    iterates by assigning data points to clusters defined by representative points
    (cluster centroids) and gradually updates these centroids until convergence is
    achieved.'

- en: '**Hierarchical clustering**: as their name suggests, these algorithms build
    a hierarchical tree-based structure using a top-down approach (splitting the set
    of data points until having a desired number of subgroups) or a bottom-up approach
    (gradually merging similar data points like bubbles into larger and larger groups).
    **AHC** (*Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering*) is a common example of a bottom-up
    hierarchical clustering algorithm.'

    of data points to form clusters. **DBSCAN** (*Density-Based Spatial Clustering

    the 'body mass' and 'culmen length' attributes. From the bottom-left to the top-right
    corner of the plot, penguins in the first group are characterized by being small
    due to their low values of 'body mass', but they exhibit largely varying bill
    lengths. Penguins in the second group have medium size and medium to high values
    of 'bill length'. Lastly, penguins in the third group are characterized by being
    larger and having a longer bill.

    with atypical values far from the majority. This is especially noticeable with
    the dot at the very top of the visualization area, indicating some observed penguins
    with an overly long bill across all three groups.

    as the process of finding subgroups of elements with similar characteristics or
