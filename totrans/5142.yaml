    practice is the key to mastering SQL. And in this guide, we’ll go over a list

    already know and the bandwidth you have to practice. If you’re actively interviewing,
    it's always a good idea to double down on interview questions and refresh some
    tricky concepts like window functions, subqueries, and common table expressions.
