    well received... so it's obviously time for another. Here are another 10 courses
    to help with your spring learning season. Courses range from introductory machine
    learning to deep learning to natural language processing and beyond.

    blocks and the theory necessary to be a responsible machine learning practitioner
    in your own community. Each module focuses on accessible examples designed to
    teach you about good practices and the powerful (yet surprisingly simple) algorithms
    we use to model data.

    and deep learning algorithmically (discussing the math behind these methods on
    a basic level) and implementing network models in code as well as applying these
    to real-world datasets. Some of the topics that will be covered include convolutional
    neural networks for image classification and object detection, recurrent neural
    networks for modeling text, and generative adversarial networks for generating
    new data.

    not required: Deep Generative Models and Self-supervised Learning. Recent advances
    in generative models have made it possible to realistically model high-dimensional
    raw data such as natural images, audio waveforms and text corpora. Strides in
    self-supervised learning have started to close the gap between supervised representation
    learning and unsupervised representation learning in terms of fine-tuning to unseen
    tasks. This course will cover the theoretical foundations of these topics as well
    as their newly enabled applications.'

    motivations and how to implement it in practice. As part of the course we will
    cover multilayer perceptrons, backpropagation, automatic differentiation, and
    stochastic gradient descent. Moreover, we introduce convolutional networks for
    image processing, starting from the simple LeNet to more recent architectures
    such as ResNet for highly accurate models. Secondly, we discuss sequence models
    and recurrent networks, such as LSTMs, GRU, and the attention mechanism. Throughout
    the course we emphasize efficient implementation, optimization and scalability,
    e.g. to multiple GPUs and to multiple machines. The goal of the course is to provide
    both a good understanding and good ability to build modern nonparametric estimators.

- en: The course introduces students to the design of algorithms that enable machines
    to learn based on reinforcements. In contrast to supervised learning where machines
    learn from examples that include the correct decision and unsupervised learning
    where machines discover patterns in the data, reinforcement learning allows machines
    to learn from partial, implicit and delayed feedback. This is particularly useful
    in sequential decision making tasks where a machine repeatedly interacts with
    the environment or users. Applications of reinforcement learning include robotic
    control, autonomous vehicles, game playing, conversational agents, assistive technologies,
    computational finance, operations research, etc.

    for exploring and reasoning about text as data, focusing especially on the applied
    side of NLP — using existing NLP methods and libraries in Python in new and creative
    ways (rather than exploring the core algorithms underlying them.)

    lecture and in-class lab work using Jupyter notebooks (roughly 50% each). Students
    will be programming extensively during class, and will work in groups with other
    students and the instructors. Students must prepare for each class and submit
    preparatory materials before class; attendance in class is required.

    on machine learning at UBC, including material from over 80 lectures covering
    a large number of topics related to machine learning. The notation is fairly consistent
    across the topics which makes it easier to see relationships, and the topics are
    meant to be gone through in order (with the difficulty slowly increasing and concepts
    being defined at their first occurrence). I'm putting this in one place in case
    people find it useful for educational purposes.
