    that data science projects are crucial for developing the whole package of technical
    data science skills. That’s true, they are. But what’s also vital is having high-quality
    datasets for your data science projects. Collecting quality data is just [one
    of the stages of a data science project](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/from-data-collection-to-model-deployment-6-stages-of-data-science-project/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+16+websites+for+ds+projects),
    but the one that can make or break it.
