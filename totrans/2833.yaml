    fields of computer vision and [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP)
    are making breakthroughs that no one could’ve predicted. We see both of them in
    our lives more and more, facial recognition in your smartphones, language translation
    software, self-driving cars and so on. What might seem sci-fi is becoming a reality,
    and it is only a matter of time before we attain [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence).

    in the subject of computer vision. Today, the error rate in humans is only 3%
    in computer vision. This means computers are already better at recognizing and
    analyzing images than humans. What an amazing feat! Decades ago, computers were
    hunks of machinery the size of a room; today, they can perceive the world around
    us in ways that we never thought possible.

    isn’t just a celebration for computer geeks and AI experts, it has real-world
    applications that save lives and make the world a better place. Before I blab
    about a life-saving application of computer vision, let me illustrate to you the
    power of computer vision.

    into their respective species, are you able to do that? Well, you can, but you
    have to be a dog expert, and it’ll take days by the time you’re done. But for
    a computer (with a GPU), this takes mere minutes. This incredible capability of
    computer vision opens up a profusion of applications.

    diabetic retinopathy — which is a diabetes complication that affects the eye.
    Now to diagnose it, an extensive eye exam is required. In third-world countries
    and rural villages where there is a paucity of doctors, a machine learning model
    that uses computer vision to make a diagnosis will be extremely beneficial. As
    with all medical imaging fields, this computer vision can also be a second opinion
    for the domain experts, ensuring the credibility of their diagnosis. Generally,
    the purpose of computer vision in the medical field is to replicate the expertise
    of specialists and deploy it in places where people need it the most.

    put to use in their search ranking algorithms, This helped enhance the search
    results for myriads of different kinds of queries that were previously very difficult.

    searches done by users and help provide better and more accurate answers.

    Learning developers use today to perform all kinds of unit tasks. He believes
    these models are inefficient and computationally expensive, and more effort is
    required to achieve good results in those tasks.

- en: To elaborate, in the ML world today, experts find a problem that they want to
    solve, and they focus on finding the right dataset to train the model and perform
    that particular task. Dean argues that by doing so, they basically start from
    zero — they initialize the parameter of the model with random floating points
    and then try to learn about everything that tasks from the dataset.

    to learn something new and taking a brain out and putting in a different one in.
    Not only is this method computationally expensive, but more effort is also required
    to achieve good outcomes in those tasks. And Jeff Dean proposes a solution.

    model that can do plenty of things. This uber model will eliminate the need to
    create models that do specific tasks and instead train this one large model with
    different pieces of expertise. Imagine a computer vision model that can diagnose
    diabetic retinopathy, classify different species of dogs, recognize your face
    and be used in self-driving cars and drones at the same time.
  prefs: []

    pieces of the model that is required. The model will be 99% idle most of the time,
    and you only have to call upon the right fragment of expertise when needed.

    But there are adverse implications to this advancement as well, such as China
    using facial recognition to implement a rating system on the people (straight
    out of an episode from the TV show black mirror) and the proliferation of fake
    news. We must progress in Machine Learning while taking into account of algorithmic
    biases and ethics that remind us of our place, a creation of God and not creators.

- en: As for the uber model, there is much evidence proving we are inching closer
    and closer towards it. For example, transfer learning — a way of reusing the model
    for a different purpose achieves good results with fewer data and multi-task learning
    — a model that operates at small scales of five or six related things all tend
    to make things work well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, it’s logical to say that the realization of an uber model is plausible
    by extending those ideas — transfer learning and multi-task learning — out and
    developing on them, it’s only a matter of when and not how.
