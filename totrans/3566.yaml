    by fine-tuning large language models and deploying them to production. Due to
    this demand, MLOps engineering has become increasingly important. Rather than
    hiring just data scientists or machine learning engineers, companies are looking
    for individuals who can automate and streamline the process of training, evaluating,
    versioning, deploying, and monitoring models in the cloud.

    MLOps engineering, including setting up the environment, experiment tracing and
    versioning, orchestration, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD),
    model serving and deployment, and model monitoring. In the final step, we will
    build a fully automated end-to-end machine-learning pipeline using various MLOps
    tools.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to train and evaluate machine learning models, you will first need
    to set up both a local and cloud environment. This involves containerizing machine
    learning pipelines, models, and frameworks using Docker. After that, you will
    learn to use Kubernetes to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of
    these containerized applications.

- en: Model serving is a critical aspect of utilizing machine learning models effectively
    in production environments. By employing model serving frameworks such as BentoML,
    Kubeflow, Ray Serve, or TFServing, you can efficiently deploy your models as microservices,
    making them accessible and scalable across multiple applications and services.
    These frameworks provide a seamless way to test model inference locally and offer
    features for you to securely and efficiently deploy models in production.

    of your model's performance and detect any changes in your data over time. You
    can use tools like Evidently, Fiddler, or even write custom code for real-time
    monitoring and alerting. By using a monitoring framework, you can build a fully
    automated machine learning pipeline where any significant decrease in model performance
    will trigger the CI/CD pipeline. This will result in re-training the model on
    the latest dataset and eventually deploying the latest model to production.
