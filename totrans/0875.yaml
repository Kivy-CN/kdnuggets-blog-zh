    value. In data science and statistics, the two most important measures of central
    tendency are the mean and median.

- en: For a dataset with *N* observations, the mean value is computed by adding all
    the data values and dividing by *N*. The mean value is easy to compute, but is
    highly susceptible to the presence of outliers in the dataset.

- en: The median is an important measure of central tendency that is less susceptible
    to the presence of outliers. The median value for a dataset can be determined
    by sorting the dataset and then determining the middle value such that 50% of
    the dataset values are less than the median value, and 50% are greater than the
    median value.

- en: To illustrate the concept of central tendency, we calculate the mean and median
    for two datasets. The first dataset is a sample dataset with no outliers, and
    the second dataset is a sample dataset with outliers.

- en: We observe that the presence of outliers in the second dataset led to an increase
    in the mean value from 5.006 to 20.45, while the change in the median value from
    5.075 to 5.565 was very small compared to the change in the mean value. This shows
    that the median value is a robust measure of central tendency as it is less susceptible
    to the presence of outliers in the dataset.

- en: In summary, we have reviewed the two most important metrics for calculating
    central tendency. The mean value is easy to compute, but is highly susceptible
    to the presence of outliers in the dataset. The median is a robust measure of
    central tendency, and is less susceptible to the presence of outliers.
