- en: If you are wondering why open data is so necessary, the simple answer is that
    it accelerates innovation, reduces biases, improves the quality, and reduces the
    cost of data collection. To understand it better we will learn the advantages
    of open data in detail.

- en: Interoperability means the ability of diverse organizations or systems to work
    together. In our case, combining multiple data, working on complex problems using
    similar data, and allowing different components to work together. Interoperability
    is necessary to solve complex problems that support various organizations to discover
    new ways to improve current systems and develop new products and services.

- en: When data is openly shared, we save a lot of resources in collecting the new
    dataset. We are not just saving the cost. We are also saving time and human resources
    that are required to collect a completely new dataset. Open data can also help
    companies to divert resources in the research and development of new products
    fast.

- en: When data is used and reused by multiple parties, there is a high chance of
    finding mistakes that can be corrected. Over time collective use of data will
    create a higher level of confidence in the source, which will help us avoid uncertainty
    and biasness.

- en: The solutions or methodologies provided in research publication should be reproducible
    and verified. It is only possible if the data is shared along with research solutions.
    Verification will improve the quality of research and accelerate innovation. It
    also helps us avoid biases in machine learning models to create inclusive data
    applications, that are built for common benefits.
