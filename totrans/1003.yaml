- en: I believe in practice. Practice as an application of knowledge and ideas. One
    idea I don’t believe in is the one saying the road between theory and practice
    is a one-way highway. In other words, it tells us that practice is simply the
    application of theoretical principles. But practice is much more; it is also a
    birthplace of ideas that gives a push to new theories.

    abreast with the latest technologies, and gaining better theoretical foundations
    is nothing to frown upon. I highly recommend that! But whatever the updates you
    get, your work as a data scientist will still boil down to several fundamental
    skills: data collection, analysis, and visualization.'

    them yourself. The most comprehensive way is to think of the [data science project](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/19-data-science-project-ideas-for-beginners/)
    and do it from start to finish.

    and analysis, you would get insights, which you could present in some nice visualizations.
    Finally, you could post it on reddit, get the feedback and potentially take them
    into account to improve your project.

    Spotify through the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
    The Spotify metadata can then be connected with the lyrics from [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1)

    count the words in total or only unique words. Do you include singalong parts
    like ‘na na na’ or ‘la la la’?

    future tastes. You could include some other parameters, such as the song length
    or the intro length. Especially the intro would be interesting to see because
    the studies, [such as the one by The Ohio State University](https://www.rewire.org/streaming-changed-music-written/),
    show a dramatic decrease in the songs' intros length throughout the years.

    or [reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) to get the data you’ll work with.
    Based on the data you have, you can analyze the posts on social media and separate
    the fake news from the non-fake ones. Your approach could be more general, but
    you can also focus on something. For example, take up a topic such as COVID-19
    pandemics, USA presidential elections, or the war in Ukraine. You could analyze
    the geographical distribution of fake news, the demographics of those spreading
    them, or the topics that are the most fake news susceptible.

    find some ideas on the approach in [work by Kai Shu, Depak Deepak Mahudeswaran,
    and Huan Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328271325_FakeNewsTracker_a_tool_for_fake_news_collection_detection_and_visualization).

    or gender representation on the postage stamps, this project could be for you.
    The idea is to use the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)
    to get the list of people on the postage stamps, e.g., [in the USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_on_the_postage_stamps_of_the_United_States).
    You can also do that for some other countries, even the whole world. Maybe even
    compare data across the countries to see how they compare. One of the ideas is
    also to connect this data with the [inequality data](https://wid.world/data/).
    It would be interesting to see how the inequality of representation on the postage
    stamps correlates with the country's economic inequality.

    why I tried to select projects that touched different areas of our lives.
