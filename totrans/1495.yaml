    information from data. When doing Data Science, what we’re really trying to do
    is explain what all of the data actually *means* in the real-world, beyond the
    numbers.

- en: To extract the information embedded in complex datasets, Data Scientists employ
    a number of tools and techniques including data exploration, visualisation, and
    modelling. One very important class of mathematical technique often used in data
    exploration is **statistics**.

- en: In a practical sense, statistics allows us to define concrete mathematical summaries
    of our data. Rather than trying to describe every single data point, we can use
    statistics to describe some of its properties. And that’s often enough for us
    to extract some kind of information about the structure and make-up of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    complicated. Yes, it can get a bit abstract, but we don’t always need to resort
    to the complex theories to get some kind of value out of statistical techniques.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The central tendency of a dataset or feature variable is the *center* or *typical
    value* of the set. The idea is that there may be one single value that can best
    describe (to an extent) our dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, imagine if you had a normal distribution centered at the x-y position
    of (100, 100). Then the point (100, 100) is the central tendency since, out of
    all the points to choose from, it is the one that provides the best summary of
    the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For Data Science, we can use central tendency measures to get a quick and simple
    idea of how our dataset looks as a whole. The “center” of our data can be a very
    valuable piece of information, telling us how exactly the dataset is *biased*,
    since whichever value the data revolves around is essentially a bias.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

- en: '**Mean**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mean value of a dataset is the *average value* i.e. a number around which
    a whole data is spread out. All values used in calculating the average are weighted
    equally when defining the Mean.

    fast to compute with Python libraries like Numpy

    them are right or wrong, but we can pick one based on our situation and goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computing the Median requires sorting the data — this won’t be practical if
    your dataset is large.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    since the Mean will be pulled one way or the other if there are some very high
    magnitude outlier values.

    which it is *squeezed* towards a single value or more spread out across a wider
    range.

    fall within a fairly narrow range. The red curve has the largest spread value

    high or low it is positioned in the range of values.
  prefs: []

    be split into two parts. The lower part contains **p** percent of the data i.e
    the pth percentile.

    parts at the number 15, 70% of the remaining data is less than 15.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Percentiles combined with the mean and standard deviation can give us a good
    idea of where a specific point lies within the spread / range of our data. If
    it’s an outlier, then its percentile will be close to the ends — less than 5%
    or great than 95%. On the other hand, if the percentile is calculated as close
    to 50 then we know that it’s close our our central tendency.

    Gaussian. The greater the magnitude of the skewness, the further from a Gaussian
    distribution our dataset is.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The covariance of two features variables measures how “related” they are. If
    the two variables have a positive covariance, then when one variable increases
    so does the other; with a negative covariance the values of the feature variables
    will change in opposite directions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Correlation**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Correlation is simply the normalised (scaled) covariance where we divide by
    the product of the standard deviation of the two variables being analysed. This
    effectively forces the range of correlation to always be between -1.0 and 1.0.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the correlation of two feature variables is 1.0, then the variables have
    a perfect positive correlation. This means that if one variable changes by a given
    amount, the second moves proportionally in the same direction.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A positive correlation coefficient less than one indicates a less than perfect
    positive correlation, with the strength of the correlation growing as the number
    approaches one. The same idea works for negative values of correlation, just with
    the values of the feature variables changing in opposite directions rather than
    changing in the same direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowing about correlation is incredibly useful for techniques like [Principal
    Component Analysis](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fprincipal-component-analysis-your-tutorial-and-code-9719d3d3f376)
    (PCA) used for Dimensionality Reduction. We start by computing a correlation matrix — if
    there are 2 or more variables which are highly correlated, then they are effectively
    redundant in explaining our data and some of them can be dropped to reduce the
    complexity.
