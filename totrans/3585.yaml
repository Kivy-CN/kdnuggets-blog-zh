- en: MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a collection of techniques and tools
    for model deployment in a production environment. In the past years, the success
    of DevOps in minimising the time between software releases and minimising gaps
    has been integral in any company's lifetime.

    apply the DevOps principle, which created the MLOps. By combining the CI/CD principle
    with the machine learning model, the data world can integrate and deliver models
    in time mannerly within production. MLOps introduce new principles of Continous
    Training (CT) and Continous Monitoring, making the production environment even
    further suitable for any machine learning model.

    knowledge of MLOps, machine learning, and programming. With that in mind, let’s
    continue with the best practices.

- en: 1\. Establishing a Clear Project Structure
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MLOps is easier to assess with a clear structure for your company's use cases.
    There are no exact MLOps pipeline and tools for every single point, so we need
    a clear structure for our project. A well-organized project structure makes navigating,
    maintaining, and scaling our future projects more manageable.
  prefs: []

    business problem until the production and monitoring need to be precise. Some
    **tips to improve our project structure** include:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Organize our code and data based on the environment and function. Also, keeps
    the code and data name convention neat to avoid mishap,'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    our project in the long run.

- en: 2\. Know Your Tools Stack
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MLOps is not only about the concept, but it’s also about the tools. There are
    many tools to choose from for every activity in your MLOps. However, the choices
    depend on your project and company requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if your company's compliance requires that the data analysis be
    done in the tools created by the home company, we must follow it. That is why
    knowing the tools stack you want to use in your MLOps pipeline when we develop
    the capability is essential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To help you understand the necessary tools for your project, here is the **MLOps
    Stack Template** by [Valohai](https://valohai.com/blog/the-mlops-stack/) that
    you can refer to.

    the more complicated it will become.

- en: 3\. Track Your Expenses
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The aim of using MLOps in our pipeline is to minimise technical debt. It’s a
    great aim, as we don’t want technical debt to complicate our project. However,
    don’t let the monetary expenses to become high just because we want to minimise
    our technical debt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the tools used for MLOps were subscription-based or pay-per-use based,
    depending on the tools themselves. Rather than develop it from scratch or using
    an open-source based, many paying tools offer a service that allows users to integrate
    MLOps with a better experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, sometimes, we need to remember that the services require us to pay money,
    and we use them sparsely, which happens to me as well in my early time adopting
    MLOps. Remember to track our expenses well, as we don’t want the value provided
    by MLOps to be diminished by money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using cloud services such as AWS, a calculator, and an alarm would remind you
    of your expenses. If not, try to track them using various tools. Even simple Excel
    already works.

- en: 4\. Having a Standard for Everything
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We not only have a straightforward structure project, but we also need **a standard
    for every part of our MLOps pipeline**. Minimising technical debt means we want
    everything to work correctly, and often the fault is because there needs to be
    a standard in the team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine that the naming of the tools, variables, scripts, data, etc., were random,
    and there was no coherence between one teammate and the other. The process would
    become even longer as the developer needs to understand what happens, and it would
    incur technical debt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Standardise applied not only to the naming conventions but could also apply
    to everything that related to the MLOps pipeline. The data analysis process, the
    environment used, the pipeline structure, the deployment process, and more. Have
    all the standards in place, and the MLOps would work well.

- en: 5\. Assess Your MLOps Maturity Periodically
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How far is our MLOps readiness already is a question that we need to ask often.
    We want to get the full benefit of the MLOps, which could only be present if the
    maturity level is already there. Sadly, it’s not something you can achieve in
    a day or even a month.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It would take some time, but that is why don’t wait for a perfect pipeline when
    you start implementing MLOps. Instead, start with a thing that we can process
    first and keep assessing the readiness of our MLOps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a reference, I love to use the MLOps maturity pyramid by [Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/mlops/mlops-maturity-model)
    to assess readiness. There are five levels, and each level provides value to our
    ecosystem.
