    quickly when the organizations that are struggling with their AI roadmap begin
    to lose their data scientists. And, it is rightly so. The field demands keeping
    oneself up-to-date with the latest technology trends and being hands-on too. The
    moment DS teams realize that the company’s AI vision is more of a fancy aspiration
    rather than a strong business proposition, they would soon make a move. Hence,
    the presence of a CAIO solidifies the AI vision as well as affirms the team’s
    confidence that everyone’s working in the right direction toward making a meaningful
    business impact.
