- en: When looking at data scientist salaries and data science roles, it became obvious
    that there are different, more specific facets within data science. These facets
    relate to unique job positions, specifically, machine learning operations, NLP,
    data engineering, and data science itself. Of course, there are even more specific
    positions than these, but these can give you a general summary of what to expect
    if you land a job in one of these positions. I wanted to pick these four roles,
    too, because they can be separated well, almost as if it was there was a clustering
    algorithm that found jobs that were the most different between one another but
    that were also in the same population. Below, I will be discussing the average
    base pay with a low and high range, as well as respective seniority levels, the
    number of estimates used to determine these numbers, and expected skills and experiences
    for each role.

    data science models into a production environment, usually comprising of both
    software engineering and, of course, machine learning algorithm knowledge. With
    that being said, you can imagine quite a good salary. This particular estimate
    comes from [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/machine-learning-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,25.htm) [3].

    models or machine learning algorithms to text data. Some examples of NLP work
    would be topic modeling large amounts of texts, semantic analysis, and chatbot
    agents. With that being said, you can imagine quite a good salary as well — however,
    this salary breakdown will be lower than a machine learning engineer, most likely
    because this role is less inclusive and more focused on a particular topic within
    data science. This particular estimate comes from [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/nlp-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,12.htm) [5]

    science, is data engineering. However, this role is ***still*** critical to data
    science work, and sometimes, a data scientist can expect to know most of what
    a data engineer would know so that is why I will include it in this analysis.
    Some examples of data engineering would be creating an ETL job that stores data
    ultimately used for a data science model, as well as storing the model results
    automatically, and performing query optimization. This particular estimate comes

    like it is the most general, it can actually be specific as well, usually composing
    of the model building process mainly— with sometimes having requirements of data
    engineering and machine learning engineer operations, and somewhat less likely
    — but still could involve having specialization in natural language processing
    (*usually if the focus is NLP, then a data scientist will have that as their title
    — but not all the time*). This role can have more variability still, so we can
    expect a wide range as well. This particular estimate comes from [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-scientist-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm) [9]

    be said about their salary ranges. Nearly three of the four salaries were similar,
    with one standing out. That role was machine learning engineer — *why is that?* My
    understanding is that this role requires a knowledge of most data science concepts,
    and especially their output, as well the software engineering involved around
    deployment — that is a lot to know and employ, so it makes sense why a role that
    composes both software engineering and data science pays so well. In addition
    to the salary breakdown of each data science role — or similar to data science
    in some way, were the skills that you can expect to employ, so that you can have
    a better idea of the role and how that relates to the salary amount.
