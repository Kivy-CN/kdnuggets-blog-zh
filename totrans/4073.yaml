- en: '[Python Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open-source toolkit which
    provides data scientists and analysts with data manipulation and analysis capabilities
    using the Python programming language. The Pandas library is very popular in the
    preprocessing phase of machine learning and deep learning. But now you can do
    more with it…'

    A Python library that integrates generative artificial intelligence capabilities
    into Pandas, making data frames conversational.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means exactly what it says - you can speak with your dataset. Yes, you
    heard it, you can talk to your data and get fast responses. As a data scientist
    or analyst, you won't need to be staring at your dataset, skimming through rows
    and columns for endless hours anymore. Pandas AI does not replace Pandas, it just
    gives it a big push!

- en: Data scientists and analysts spend a lot of time cleaning data for the analysis
    phase. They will now be able to take their data analysis to the next level. Data
    professionals look into different methods and processes that they can use to minimize
    the time spent on data preparation, and now they can with Pandas AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PandasAI is to be used hand-in-hand with Pandas, it is not a replacement for
    Pandas. Rather than having to skim through and answer questions about the dataset
    yourself, you can ask PandasAI these questions and it will return answers in the
    form of Pandas DataFrames.

- en: With that being said, does this mean that people no longer need to be proficient
    in Python to achieve data analysis using tools such as the Pandas library?

- en: With the help of [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), Pandas AI
    aims to achieve the goal of virtually talking with a machine to output the results
    you want rather than having to program the task yourself. The machine will output
    the result in their language - machine-interpretable code (DataFrame).
