- en: Face recognition, or facial recognition, is one of the largest areas of research
    within computer vision. We can now use face recognition to unlock our mobile phones,
    verify identification at security gates, and in some countries, make purchases.
    With the ability to make numerous processes more efficient, many companies invest
    into the research and development of facial recognition technology. This article
    will highlight some of that research and introduce five machine learning papers
    on face recognition.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a multitude of real-world applications, face recognition technology is
    becoming more and more prominent. From smartphone unlocking to face verification
    payment methods, facial recognition could improve security and surveillance in
    many ways. However, the technology also poses several risks. Numerous face spoofing
    methods could be used to fool these systems. Therefore, face anti-spoofing is
    essential to prevent security breaches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to support face anti-spoofing research, the authors of this paper introduce
    a multi-modal face anti-spoofing dataset named CASIASURF. As of the writing of
    this paper, it is the largest open dataset for face anti-spoofing. Specifically,
    the dataset includes 21,000 videos taken of 1,000 subjects in RGB, Depth, and
    IR modalities. In addition to the dataset, the authors present a novel multi-modal
    fusion model as a baseline for face anti-spoofing.

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, the authors present a face recognition system called FaceNet.
    This system uses a deep convolutional neural network which optimizes the embedding,
    rather than using an intermediate bottleneck layer. The authors state that the
    most important aspect of this method is the end-to-end learning of the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The team trained the convolutional neural network on a CPU cluster for 1,000
    to 2,000 hours. They then evaluated their method on four datasets. Notably, FaceNet
    attained an accuracy of 99.63% on the famous Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset,
    and 95.12% on the Youtube Faces Database.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As of the writing of this article, current embedding methods used for face recognition
    are able to achieve high performance in controlled settings. These methods work
    by taking an image of a face and storing data about that face in a latent semantic
    space. However, when tested in fully uncontrolled settings, the current methods
    cannot perform as well. This is due to instances where facial features are absent
    from or ambiguous in the image. An example of such a case would be face recognition
    in surveillance videos, where the quality of the video may be low.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To help address this issue, the authors of this paper propose Probabilistic
    Face Embeddings (PFEs). The authors propose a method for converting existing deterministic
    embeddings into PFEs. Most importantly, the authors state that this method effectively
    improves performance in face recognition models.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this study, researchers from SenseTime Research, the University of California
    San Diego, and Nanyang Technological University studied the effects of noise in
    large-scale face image datasets. Many large datasets are prone to label noise,
    due to their scale and cost-effective nature. With this paper, the authors aim
    to provide knowledge around the source of label noise and the consequences it
    has in face recognition models. Additionally, they aim to build and release a
    clean face recognition dataset titled IMDb-Face.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two of the main goals of the study were to discover the effects of noise on
    final performance, and determine the best strategy to annotate face identities.
    To do so, the team manually cleaned two popular open face image datasets, MegaFace
    and MS-Celeb-1M. Their experiments showed that a model trained on just 32% of
    their cleaned MegaFace dataset and 20% of the cleaned MS-Celeb-1M dataset achieved
    similar performance to models trained on the entirety of the original uncleaned
    datasets.

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Numerous studies have been done on deep convolutional neural networks for facial
    recognition. In turn, numerous large-scale face image datasets have been created
    to train those models. However, the authors of this paper state that the previously
    released datasets do not contain much data on pose and age variation in faces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, researchers from the University of Oxford introduce the VGGFace2
    dataset. This dataset includes images which have a wide range of age, ethnicity,
    illumination, and pose variations. In total, the dataset contains 3.31 million
    images and 9,131 subjects.
