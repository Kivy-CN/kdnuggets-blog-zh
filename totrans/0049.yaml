- en: I like to think of ChatGPT as a smarter version of StackOverflow. Very helpful,
    but not replacing professionals any time soon. As a former data scientist, I spent
    a solid amount of time playing around with ChatGPT when it came out. I was pretty
    impressed with its coding capacity. It could generate pretty useful code from
    scratch; it could offer suggestions on my own code. It was pretty good at debugging
    if I asked it to help me with an error message.

    license it was under. And even if it was generated fully from scratch, anything
    created by ChatGPT is not copyrightable itself. As Bloomberg Law writers Shawn
    Helms and Jason Krieser [put it](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/external/document/XDDQ1PNK000000/copyrights-professional-perspective-copyright-chaos-legal-implic),
    “A ‘derivative work’ is ‘a work based upon one or more preexisting works.’ ChatGPT
    is trained on preexisting works and generates output based on that training.”

    significant difference in satisfaction ratings across different age groups. ChatGPT
    suggests an independent sample T-test and finds no statistically significant difference
    in age groups. But the t-test isn't the best choice here for several reasons,
    like the fact that there might be multiple age groups, or that the data aren’t
    normally distributed.

    can pull from the 1,000s of StackOverflow answers to questions asking the same
    thing. But (using an example I asked ChatGPT to generate), what about something
    it’s unlikely to have come across before, such as organizing a community potluck
    where each person's dish must contain an ingredient that starts with the same
    letter as their last name and you want to make sure there's a good variety of
    dishes.

  zh: 想知道如何更改 R 图中的图例大小吗？没问题——ChatGPT 可以从成千上万的 StackOverflow 答案中获取相同问题的解决方案。但是（使用我要求
    ChatGPT 生成的一个例子），如果是一个它不太可能遇到的情况，比如组织一个社区聚餐，每个人的菜肴必须包含一个以其姓氏首字母为开头的成分，并确保有多样的菜肴，那该怎么办？
- en: When I tested this prompt, it gave me some Python code that decided the *name*
    of the dish had to match the last name, not even capturing the ingredient requirement
    correctly. It also wanted me to come up with 26 dish categories, one per letter
    of the alphabet. It was not a smart answer, probably because it was a completely
    novel problem.

  zh: 当我测试这个提示时，它给了我一些 Python 代码，决定了*菜肴*的名字必须与姓氏匹配，甚至没有正确捕捉到成分要求。它还要求我想出26种菜肴类别，每种字母一个。这不是一个聪明的答案，可能是因为这是一个完全新颖的问题。

  zh: 道德编码涉及考虑代码可能如何影响不同的群体，确保它不歧视或造成伤害，并做出符合道德标准和社会规范的决策。
- en: For example, if you ask ChatGPT to write code for a loan approval system, it
    might churn out a model based on historical data. However, it cannot understand
    the societal implications of that model potentially denying loans to marginalized
    communities due to biases in the data. It would be up to the human developers
    to recognize the need for fairness and equity, to seek out and correct biases
    in the data, and to ensure that the code aligns with ethical practices.
  id: totrans-42

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 例如，如果你让 ChatGPT 编写一个贷款审批系统的代码，它可能会生成一个基于历史数据的模型。然而，它无法理解该模型可能因数据中的偏见而拒绝向边缘化社区提供贷款的社会影响。需要人类开发者识别公平与公正的需求，寻求并纠正数据中的偏见，并确保代码符合道德实践。

    [Amazon’s biased recruitment tool](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G),
    and someone coded the [Google photo categorization](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai)

    缺乏编写道德代码所需的同理心、良知和道德推理能力。
- en: Humans can understand the broader context, recognize the subtleties of human
    behavior, and have discussions about right and wrong. We participate in ethical
