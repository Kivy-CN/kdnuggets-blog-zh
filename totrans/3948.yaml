    impressions of being very hard to understand – complex – and that you’re required
    to have the highest grade education in order to understand them.

    only need to spend a certain amount of time learning something, practicing it,
    before we realize that it’s not really all that hard.

    such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and plenty more ([including security agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_intelligence_agencies)),
    but if we continue to look up to them; we will always think it’s hard, because
    we have never given ourselves the chance to look at real examples and facts.

    mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) and [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis),
    and hopefully be able to make better judgement of what they do, and how they can
    help you in your working projects, both now and in the future.

    to have a completely open mind, be open to every possibility, because that is
    usually where all the learning happens, and no doubt your brain is going to set
    itself on fire; multiple times.

    many people who enjoy analyzing data and who could happily spend all day looking
    at histograms and averages, but for those who prefer other activities, data science
    offers a range of roles and requires a range of skills. Let’s consider this idea
    by thinking about some of the data involved in buying a box of cereal.
