- en: Well, if you have a degree in computer science or a closely related field, you
    probably don't need a certification when you start looking for software developer
    roles. But today, many we know are looking to switch to software roles—from non-tech
    or tech-adjacent roles. And that’s where certifications can help.

    your interest and makes learning the essential skills for the role you’re targeting
    much easier. Also, there are several high-quality certifications that have a carefully
    designed curriculum covering tens of hours of coding exercises and projects. So
    if you are looking to become a developer, the following certificates will help
    you learn the most relevant and essential skills you need to make the cut!
