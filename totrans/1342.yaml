- en: I’ve been writing about data science on Medium for just over two years. Writing,
    in particular, technical writing can be time-consuming. Not only do you need to
    come up with an idea, write well, edit your articles for accuracy and flow, and
    proofread them. With technical articles you often also need to produce code to
    illustrate your explanations, ensure that it is accurate and transfer that code
    from the tool you used to write it, to your Medium post.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I try to publish once or twice a week. When I first started writing I found
    that the process could be very time consuming, and it was difficult to maintain
    this schedule around a full-time day job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time I have found some tools that have hugely sped up the time it takes
    for me to create and publish an article. Particularly those containing coded examples.
    The following tools help me to achieve my goal of publishing one to two articles
    per week around my other life commitments.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This tool was only released in May this year by Ted Petrou but it is a game-changer
    if you write your code in Jupyter Notebooks. With this Python package, you can
    publish the entire content of your notebook as a blog post directly into your
    Medium account.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use this tool first you need to pip install it into your project environment.

    as,** you will now find an option to deploy as a **Medium post**.

- en: When you select this option you will be presented with a form. At the top, it
    asks for an integration token. If you are a regular writer on Medium you may have
    access to this in the settings in your Medium account. If you don’t have a token
    in your settings you will need to contact Medium to request one via this email
    address yourfriends@medium.com.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From my experience, you will get a response quite quickly, typically within
    1 to 2 days.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can either paste your integration token into this form each time or, to
    save having to repeatedly access it, you can save the token as a file and directory
    labelled in the following way`.jupyter_to_medium/integration_token`.

- en: Jupyter to Medium will publish your markdown as text, code as code blocks and
    images directly to medium as a draft. I have found that you generally only need
    to perform minimal edits to then get to a publishable blog post.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Github has a tool known as Github Gists that allow you to easily embed code
    snippets directly into your blog posts. The advantage of using Gists rather than
    code blocks in your articles is that they preserve the format of the code better,
    they promote your Github account and it is easier for readers to access your code
    to try the examples out for themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need a Github account to create a Gist. Once you have one simply navigate
    to the Gists page at [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/). Creating a Gist
    is very simple, just give it a name, paste in your code and hit publish. Once
    published you will see this page. To embed the Gist in your Medium post simply
    code the URL under ‘Embed’ and paste into your article.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Jovian.ml is a tool for hosting Jupyter Notebooks online which is very useful
    for sharing analyses externally from your local environment. Jovian recently released
    a feature which makes it possible to embed entire notebooks, snippets of code,
    cell outputs and markdown directly into your Medium posts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get started with Jovian you need to create an account on [jovian.ml](https://www.jovian.ml/).
    The free tier gives you unlimited public projects which is ideal if you are using
    it to share via a Medium blog. You then need to pip install into your local environment.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Grammarly is quite a well-known app that checks your content for typos, grammatical
    errors and even the sentiment of your text. Although an obvious tool for writing
    it took me a while to start using it, and it made such a difference to the editing
    time for my articles so I thought it was worth sharing here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Grammarly can be installed as a browser extension, locally as a desktop app
    or as a mobile app. To maximise the use of my time I write in many different environments
    so it is useful to have Grammarly installed locally if I am writing offline, in
    my browser for when I am directly writing on Medium and on my mobile if I am writing
    on the go.
