    and polls - see useful links at the end of this post, as well as external sources.
  prefs: []

- en: Altogether(*), this poll received over 1,500 votes - a large enough sample to
    make meaningful inferences. An average voter reported having 10 skills and wanted
    to add or improve 6.5 skills.

    to the first poll question, and Y-axis showing **% Want Skill** - answers to the
    2nd poll question. The size of each circle is proportional to the percent of voters
    that have that skill, while color depends on the ratio of Want/Have (red is high
    - more than 1, blue is low - less than 1).
