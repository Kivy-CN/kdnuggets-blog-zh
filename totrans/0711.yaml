    it can be confusing. That’s why [**Statology**](https://www.statology.org/) is

    statistical analysis is complete without visualizing one's data. A variety of
    tools exist for us to be able to better understand our data through visualization,
    and these tutorials will help do just that. Learn these different techniques,
    and then continue on reading Statology's archives for more gems.

    we see that height and weight have a positive relationship. As height increases,

    since it’s typically easier to gain an understanding of data when we can visualize
