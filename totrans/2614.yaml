- en: A lot happened in the machine learning community during the past year. Here’s
    a tour through the most popular and trending open-source research projects, demos,
    and prototypes. It ranges from photo editing to NLP to training models with “no-code,”
    and I hope they inspire you to build incredible AI-powered products this year.
    You can also find additional [machine learning projects here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/03/20-machine-learning-datasets-project-ideas.html).

    a cue from the popular [The World is Your Green Screen](https://github.com/senguptaumd/Background-Matting) open-source
    project and showcases how to remove or change the background in real-time. It
    gives better performance (30fps at 4K and 60fps at FHD) and can be used with Zoom,
    the popular videoconferencing app.'

    in recovering the alpha matte and the foreground layer. To process high-resolution
    images in real-time, two neural networks are used.

    a video sky replacement and harmonization, which can automatically generate realistic
    and dramatic sky backgrounds in videos with controllable styles.
  prefs: []

    and it leverages sky matting, motion estimation through optical flow, and image
    blending to provide artistic backgrounds on videos in real-time.

  prefs: []

    a deep learning implementation in PyTorch by leveraging scratch detection, face
    enhancements, and other techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As per their [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09484): “We train
    two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to respectively transform old photos and clean
    photos into two latent spaces. And the translation between these two latent spaces
    is learned with synthetic paired data. This translation generalizes well to real
    photos because the domain gap is closed in the compact latent space. Besides,
    to address multiple degradations mixed in one old photo, we design a global branch
    with a partial nonlocal block targeting the structured defects, such as scratches
    and dust spots, and a local branch targeting the unstructured defects, such as
    noises and blurriness.”'

    project](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify) shows a classic example of that
    by letting you create photo-realistic avatars in real-time video conferencing
    apps.

    do a motion extraction from the video and apply it to the target avatar image
    by using optical flow. In doing so, you can generate avatars on a virtual camera
    or even animate classic paintings. From Elon Musk to Mona Lisa, you can impersonate
    anyone for fun!
