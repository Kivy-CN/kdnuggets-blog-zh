    also added with the IRkernel. This allows users to run kernels with R and Python.

    way to have Jupyter Notebook installed, the R Version that Anaconda installs lags
    behind the latest release. You cannot update R in Anaconda the same way you would
    if you installed it separately from the R website. This is because all the programs
    in Anaconda is managed by the Conda package manager and Anaconda needs to update
    their default version of R before the users get to install it. So when running
    R in Jupyter Notebooks, some packages may not work (although this is rare) in
    the older version due to package updates happening more frequently than R updates.***'
