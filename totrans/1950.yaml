- en: This is an exciting time for data scientist, also for people like me who want
    to be data scientists. Luckily, I have been admitted to [NYU Data Science program](http://cds.nyu.edu)
    this time last year. Here is a summary of my experience in this new data science
    program. Hopefully, it can give you a more clear idea about data science at NYU.

    12 courses, 2 years. Prof. Yann LeCun was Director of Center for Data Science(CDS)
    last year. But Yann went to Facebook and now he is a part-time professor at NYU.
    Prof. Raghu Varadhan and Prof. David Hogg succeeded him as our new directors.'

    Science program named “Data Science”. [[See many other programs]](/education/usa-canada.html). But
    it is just a name, although a very hot one. CMU calls it Computational Data Science,
    which is renamed from Very Large Information Systems; Stanford doesn’t change
    the name, but it begins to offer a MS track in Data Science under Department of
    Statistics and ICME.'

    Sciences and Engineering and Cornell NYC Tech. Personally, I think amazing [faculty
    and staff](http://cds.nyu.edu/people/) and tons of opportunities outside because
    of both “the Age of Exabyte” and “the Big Apple” make it an attractive program.

    in various domains. Data science program provides the flexibility to customize
    with courses in specific subjects of interest, such as biology, economics, neuroscience,
    physics, political science, psychology and music. [Click here](http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/pre-approved-elective-courses/)

    48 of whom have been enrolled. It is slightly over 50 percent which is normal.
    I have received some questions regarding the program, like “is this program academic
    or professional”. This may seem strange, but five of the six required coursed
    are designed for the PhD program. The goal of this master program is to help all
    the students get jobs. So you can call it professional or academic, whatever you
    like.

    The state is slow because they are short of people who do the work. There is no
    feedback on the proposal itself. “We can’t advertise until and if the proposal
    is approved”, Roy said.
