- en: A typical beginner will spend a couple of hours on Google searching for data
    science courses and most of them give up. Why is that? It is because we have multiple
    options to start and we could not figure out what works best for us. In my opinion,
    we all are just lost in the stockpile of content and we don't know where to start.
    In this blog, I will guide you on what worked for me and maybe it can work for
    you too.

- en: Learning data science fundamentals is the most important part of your journey,
    as it will prepare you for the learning challenges. Most of the beginners will
    dive into courses without knowing what they want to achieve. In the end, 90% don't
    even complete the course as things get harder with time. So, if you are following
    the trend, then please learn about data science and the career path.

    friendly video tutorials. These non-technical videos will help you understand
    various components of data science; data ingestion, data cleaning, data analyzing,
    modeling, and applications. If you don't like watching videos, you can also try
    reading blogs and books. Learning data science essentials will help you understand
    the career path and introduce you to the most common tools used for data analytics
    and machine learning.

    code most of your time at your job. You can also start with **R** or **Julia**
    as they were inherently developed for statistics and scientific research. Mastering
    Python will help you with research, data visualization, designing state-of-the-art
    applications, and clearing technical interviews.

    most important tool for data ingestion and analysis. Almost all data science interviews
    will include SQL questions so, it's better to learn it at an early stage to improve
    your odds of getting hired.
