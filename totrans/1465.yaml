- en: The term “elevator pitch” originally came from the idea of entrepreneurs and
    small business owners developing a 30-second pitch when they were asked the question,
    “What do you do?” This might be at social occasions and events, etc. It was an
    opportunity for the business owner/entrepreneur to provide a very short (ergo,
    30-second) explanation of the value that they provide to their customers or clients,
    followed by presenting a business card. This activity has always been seen as
    a tool to “spread the word,” certainly not to seek funding.

- en: Over time, the elevator pitch definition has expanded significantly and now
    refers to not just the short little answer to that simple question. It has expanded
    into pitches that founders of startups use as they seek funding. Obviously, this
    type of pitch is longer and more detailed, and it occurs when such founders seek
    seed money to begin or to seek additional funding, once they have launched and
    need investment dollars to expand.

    enough that investors are looking put dollars into startups that can provide these
    services to small and mid-sized businesses that cannot afford to employ their
    own data scientist. You don’t’ yet have a huge competition in this market, and
    that puts you in a favorable position if you can get your pitch right.

    use seed money (their own, family, friends, short-term small loans, crowdfunding,
    etc.) to develop at least an MVP (minimum viable product) and then show that it
    is a viable product through the acquisition of a few customers/clients.

    Show what it has provided for the few clients you have, or provide a visual demonstration
    of how a specific aspect of your data science service provides its Barring that,
    show some stats from your initial customers. For example, “Of the 15 clients we
    initially brought on board, all 15 continue to use our services, after a full
    year of collaboration.”

- en: Access to Investors has Changed Dramatically. Seeking investors used to be a
    rather secretive process. You need to know someone who knew someone who might
    be interested. The Internet has changed all of that. With crowd-funding venues,
    lists of “angel investors,” open events that solicit pitches, etc., you can easily
    find potential funders and design your pitches to reach targeted investors individually.
    Further, networking can occur online and is no longer geo-specific.

    provided their pitch to an audience of investors, is still one avenue that is
    common. But lots of founders are getting far more proactive. They are creating
    video pitches that can be embedded in their websites and, as well, sent out and
    posted all over the place, without the need for physical presence. And consider
    the possibilities of reaching out to foreign investors – a whole new world of
    funding, particularly in the tech sector, such as data science.

    investors or preparing a script for a video presentation, you need both the elements
    of a solid pitch and [your voice](https://bestessay.education/blog/finding-you-appealing-writing-voice),
    or you will seem far less than genuine. This is challenging for techies who are
    not necessarily accomplished with words. As Susan Johnston, a scriptwriter for
    [Studicus](https://studicus.com/descriptive-essay-writing-service), states: “We
    have a large number of clients with amazing concepts and ideas who simply cannot
    translate those into compelling voices for their audiences. Techies are often
    in this position. They need to get professional help because their voice must
    be genuine and yet also one that potential clients and investors can understand.”'

    will not be sufficient. If you intend to create a video presentation (and you
    must), then understand that it has to be both professional and personal, depending
    upon your audiences. You have to research those audiences and perhaps develop
    unique scripts for each of them. And then, of course, the script must be written
    and practiced before delivery. Again, professional help may be warranted. Joe
    Lesinski, a scriptwriter for clients of [WowGrade](https://wowgrade.net/do-my-essay),
    puts it this way: “Writing a script is a specific skill that most do not have.
    Anyone who is not schooled in this skill will falter. Best to find a decent scriptwriter
    with experience in marketing video scripts, if you intend to capture an audience.”'
