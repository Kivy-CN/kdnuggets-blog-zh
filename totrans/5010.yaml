    I’ve noticed an increasing trend in people looking to learn some python as the
    next step in their data science journey.  At Mango most of our consultants are
    pretty happy using either language but as an R user of 12 or so years I’ve only
    ever dabbled with python.  Recently however I found myself having to learn quickly
    and so I thought I’d share some of my observations.

    blog posts covering the high level pros and cons of each language.  For this post
    I thought I’d get down to the nitty gritty.  What does an R user really experience
    when trying to pick up python?  In particular what does an R user that comes from
    a statistics background experience?

- en: '**Lack of Hadley**. So there is a Wes but there is a lot of duplication in
    functionality between packages.  To start with you import statistics and find
    the mean function only to find it has been re-written for pandas.  Later you find
    that everyone has their own idea on the best way to implement cross-validation. 
    All very confusing when you start out.  This brings me on to:'

- en: '**IDEs**. Hats off to RStudio for changing the R world when it comes to IDEs. 
    I remember a time before RStudio when the R GUI, StatET and Tinn-R were the norm. 
    How things have improved.  Sadly, python is not quite there yet.  As an RStudio
    user I opted for Spyder.  It’s OK but the script editor needs some work.  The
    integration in Jupyter Notebook seems much better when I chat with colleagues
    but I’m just not a big fan of notebooks.'

- en: '**Namespaces**. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve told trainees on
    an intro to R course that masking very rarely trips you up as a user (unless you’re
    building packages it really doesn’t).  Let’s just say that in python you have
    to be careful.  Bring too much in and you’ll overwrite your own objects and cause
    chaos.  This means you bring in things as and when you need them.  Having to explicitly
    import OS utilities in order to change the working directory and so on is frustrating. 
    That said, python’s capabilities are a little better than R in this area.'

    just go functional.  You also really have to know about classes to work with python
    effectively whereas a casual R user can get by without even knowing that R has
    a class system.

- en: '**Reliance on R**. On my recent project I was using the best of the statistical
    capabilities in python.  First off I should say that it’s basically all there
    (except for stepwise GLMs for some bizarre reason).  However, although I’ve always
    known that most of the statistical modelling capabilities in python have been
    ported from R the documentation is pretty lazy and most of it just points you
    at the R documentation.  The example datasets are even the same!  Speaking of
    the documentation.'

    two languages but the R documentation is much more plentiful and generally contains
    a lot more examples.'

    love it when smug coders that have developed in other languages tell me that R
    is the exception here by indexing from 1.  However, as a human being I count from
    1 and this will always make more sense to me.  Ending at n-1 is also confusing.

    R have been ported to python (I wasn’t expecting the mixed modelling or survival
    analysis capabilities to be anything like that in R for example).  However, as
    an existing R user there really is no point in switching to python for statistics. 
    The only benefit would be if you were using python for, say, extensive web-scraping
    and you wanted to be consistent.  If that’s your reason though then let me point
    you towards Chris Musselle’s blog post, “[Integrating Python and R Part II – Executing
    R from Python and Vice Versa](http://www.mango-solutions.com/wp/2015/10/integrating-python-and-r-part-ii-executing-r-from-python-and-vice-versa/)”. 
    And don’t forget that you can also just use *rvest*.

    with the intention of using it to build models.  Learn it because it’s a more
    flexible all-round programming language and you have some heavy lifting to do. 
    Just find something that’s hard to do in R and try using python for that.  Otherwise
    you’ll end up like me, writing a whingy blog post!
