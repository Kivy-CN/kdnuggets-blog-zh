- en: NLP is not something all data scientists necessarily work with and are required
    to know. Whether or not you are, depends on the company interviewing you for a
    data science position. You’re not interested in NLP. Well, you’ll have to know
    what it is so you can avoid it in your career, if nothing else.

    Processing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[As Wikipedia nicely puts it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language),
    a natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved naturally
    in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The key word in the above definition is ‘human’. In NLP, there’s an additional
    keyword: computer. From it comes the definition which says NLP deals with teaching
    computers how to understand natural language. Since it’s a computer, this understanding
    means processing and analyzing natural language data stored in different data
    formats.'

- en: 'So this is one of its uses: **autocorrect, autocomplete, and spell checkers.**
    The NLP software scans the text for grammatical and spelling errors, corrects
    them, or gives correction suggestions. There are also spell checkers that can
    ‘understand’ the whole sentence''s syntax, context, and meaning. Based on that,
    they suggest corrections or better-phrased sentences in line with the goal you’re
    trying to achieve with your text.'

    country, you probably use a translation tool, such as Google Translate. Also,
    translators are more and more used on social media, such as Facebook, Instagram,
    and Youtube.'

- en: '**Recognizing and generating speech** is also one of the NLP uses. Think of
    Google Assistant, Windows Speech Recognition, Dragon, Siri, Alexa, or Cortana;
    they all seem to understand you (more or less) when you talk. Based on what you
    tell them, they will perform a certain action, such as browsing the internet,
    typing your words, or playing your favorite song. Some of these tools can even
    talk back to you, i.e., generate speech.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NLP can also decipher the ‘feel’ of the text. In other words, they can detect
    the sentiment behind the text, not only the literal meaning. This means understanding
    emotions (happy, angry, disturbed, neutral…), sarcasm, double meaning, metaphors,
    and expressions within a context. This is called **sentiment analysis**. Think
    of understanding the social media comments and removing those breaking the terms
    of service or getting the customers’ satisfaction by analyzing their comments
    and reviews.

- en: NLP is heavily used in **online marketing**. The keywords you search are matched
    with the keywords of the companies, their products, and their ads. So when you
    start seeing ads for a product you just Googled, don’t worry. You’re not crazy;
    it’s NLP and targeted advertising at work.
