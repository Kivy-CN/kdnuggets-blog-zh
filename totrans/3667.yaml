    much and lose their way, but he could have been. *Apocalypse Now* was epic but
    also a long, difficult and expensive project to make, much like GPT-4\. I’d suggest
    that the development of LLMs has gravitated to too much money and too much equipment.
    And some of the “we just invented general intelligence” hype is a little insane.
    But now it’s the turn of open source communities to do what they do best: delivering
    free competing software using far less money and equipment.'

- en: OpenAI has taken over $11Bn in funding and it is estimated GPT-3.5 costs $5-$6m
    per training run. We know very little about GPT-4 because OpenAI isn’t telling,
    but I think it’s safe to assume that it isn’t smaller than GPT-3.5\. There is
    currently a world-wide GPU shortage and – for a change – it’s not because of the
    latest cryptocoin. Generative AI start-ups are landing $100m+ Series A rounds
    at huge valuations when they don’t own any of the IP for the LLM they use to power
    their product. The LLM bandwagon is in high gear and the money is flowing.

    Amazon, and Google could afford to train hundred-billion parameter models. Bigger
    models were assumed to be better models. GPT-3 got something wrong? Just wait
    until there''s a bigger version and it’ll all be fine! Smaller companies looking
    to compete had to raise far more capital or be left building commodity integrations
    in the ChatGPT marketplace. Academia, with even more constrained research budgets,
    was relegated to the sidelines.'

- en: Fortunately, a bunch of smart people and open source projects took this as a
    challenge rather than a restriction. Researchers at Stanford released Alpaca,
    a 7-billion parameter model whose performance comes close to GPT-3.5’s 175-Billion
    parameter model. Lacking the resources to build a training set of the size used
    by OpenAI, they cleverly chose to take a trained open source LLM, LLaMA, and fine-tune
    it on a series of GPT-3.5 prompts and outputs instead. Essentially the model learned
    what GPT-3.5 does, which turns out to be a very effective strategy for replicating
    its behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alpaca is licensed for non-commercial use only in both code and data as it uses
    the open source non-commercial LLaMA model, and OpenAI explicitly disallows any
    use of its APIs to create competing products. That does create the tantalizing
    prospect of fine-tuning a different open source LLM on the prompts and output
    of Alpaca… creating a third GPT-3.5-like model with different licensing possibilities.

- en: There is another layer of irony here, in that all of the major LLMs were trained
    on copyrighted text and images available on the Internet and they didn’t pay a
    penny to the rights holders. The companies claim the “fair use” exemption under
    US copyright law with the argument that the use is “transformative”. However,
    when it comes to the output of the models they build with free data, they really
    don’t want anyone to do the same thing to them. I expect this will change as rights-holders
    wise up, and may end up in court at some point.

- en: This is a separate and distinct point to that raised by authors of restrictive-licensed
    open source who, for generative AI for Code products like CoPilot, object to their
    code being used for training on the grounds that the license is not being followed.
    The problem for individual open-source authors is that they need to show standing
    – substantive copying – and that they have incurred damages. And since the models
    make it hard to link output code to input (the lines of source code by the author)
    and there’s no economic loss (it’s supposed to be free), it’s far harder to make
    a case. This is unlike for-profit creators (e.g, photographers) whose entire business
    model is in licensing/selling their work, and who are represented by aggregators
    like Getty Images who can show substantive copying.

- en: Another interesting thing about LLaMA is that it came out of Meta. It was originally
    released just to researchers and then leaked via BitTorrent to the world. Meta
    is in a fundamentally different business to OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon
    in that it isn’t trying to sell you cloud services or software, and so has very
    different incentives. It has open-sourced its compute designs in the past (OpenCompute)
    and seen the community improve on them – it understands the value of open source.

    Not only does it have massive resources, but it benefits if there is a proliferation
    of great generative AI technology: there will be more content for it to monetize
    on social media. Meta has released three other open-source AI models: ImageBind
    (multi-dimensional data indexing), DINOv2 (computer vision) and Segment Anything.
    The latter identifies unique objects in images and is released under the highly
    permissive Apache License.'

    Have No Moat, and Neither Does OpenAI” which takes a dim view of closed models
    vs. the innovation of communities producing far smaller, cheaper models that perform
    close to or better than their closed source counterparts. I say allegedly because
    there is no way to verify the source of the article as being Google internal.
    However, it does contain this compelling graph:'

    where open source generative AI has been able to advance faster than proprietary
    models. A recent iteration of that project (ControlNet) has improved it such that
    it has surpassed Dall-E2’s capabilities. This came about from a whole lot of tinkering
    all over the world, resulting in a pace of advance that is hard for any single
    institution to match. Some of those tinkerers figured out how to make Stable Diffusion
    faster to train and run on cheaper hardware, enabling shorter iteration cycles
    by more people.
