    perceive a need in the supply chain and order appropriately to maintain optimal
    levels, without the need for field operators or supply chain managers to do physical
    inventory counts on their own before doing so. For example, monitoring product
    on store shelves and cross referencing the remaining product inventory and current
    demand for the product, in order to actively reorder stock if demand is high and
    inventory is almost out.
