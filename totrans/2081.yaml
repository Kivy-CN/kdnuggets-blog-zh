- en: Language Models (LMs) have undoubtedly revolutionized the fields of Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a whole, driving
    significant advances in understanding and generating text. For those interested
    in venturing into this fascinating field and unsure where to start, this list
    covers five key tips that combine theoretical foundations with hands-on practice,
    facilitating a strong start in developing and harnessing LMs.

- en: Time to move to the practical side of LMs! There are a few tools and libraries
    that every LM developer should be familiar with. They provide extensive functionalities
    that greatly simplify the process of building, testing, and utilizing LMs. Such
    functionalities include loading pre-trained models -i.e. LMs that have been already
    trained upon large datasets to learn to solve language understanding or generation
    tasks-, and fine-tuning them on your data to make them specialize in solving a
    more specific problem. [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index),
    along with a knowledge of PyTorch and Tensorflow deep learning libraries, are
    the perfect combination to learn here.

    the kinds of data they require for each task. Besides its Transformers library,
    Hugging Face also hosts a [dataset hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) with
    plenty of datasets for tasks like text classification, question-answering, translation,
    etc. Explore this and other public data hubs like [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=language-modelling)
    for identifying, analyzing, and utilizing high-quality datasets for language tasks.

    learned practical skills on Hugging Face, Tensorflow, and PyTorch to train your
    first LM. You don''t need to start with something as daunting as a full (encoder-decoder)
    transformer architecture, but a simple and more manageable neural network architecture
    instead: as what matters at this point is that you consolidate the fundamental
    concepts acquired and build practical confidence as you progress towards more
    complex architectures like an encoder-only transformer for text classification.'

    model may do the job, thereby saving time and resources while achieving decent
    results for your intended goal. Get back to Hugging Face and try out a variety
    of their models to perform and evaluate predictions, learning how to fine-tune
    them on your data for solving particular tasks with improved performance.
