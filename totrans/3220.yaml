- en: Recommender systems are automated computer programs that match items to users
    in different contexts. Such systems are ubiquitous and have become an integral
    part of our daily lives. Examples include recommending products to users on a
    site like Amazon, recommending content to users visiting a website like Yahoo!,
    recommending movies to users on a site like Netflix, recommending jobs to users
    on LinkedIn, and so on. Given the significant heterogeneity in user preferences,
    providing personalized recommendations is key to the success of such systems.

    preference from feedback data is essential. Such models are constructed using
    large amounts of high-frequency data obtained from past user interactions with
    items. They are statistical in nature and involve challenges in areas like sequential
    decision processes, modeling interactions with very high-dimensional categorical
    data, and developing scalable statistical methods. New methodologies in this area
    require close collaboration among computer scientists, machine learners, statisticians,
    optimization experts, system experts, and, of course, domain experts. It is one
    of the most exciting applications of big data.

    of these systems is an easy-to-use and flexible machine learning library, called
    Photon-ML, which is key to our productivity, agility, and developer happiness.
    We have open-sourced most of the algorithms used by Photon-ML. In this article
    we focus on the personalization aspect of model building and explain the modeling
    principle as well as how to implement Photon-ML so that it can scale to hundreds
    of millions of users.

    business metrics in many product domains through Photon-ML. To provide a concrete
    example, note how we make personalized job recommendations using a Generalized
    Additive Mixed-Effect (GAME) model, which generated 20% to 40% more job applications
    for job seekers in our online A/B experiments.

- en: As the world's largest professional social network, LinkedIn provides a unique
    value proposition for its over 500 million members to connect with all kinds of
    opportunities for their career growth. One of the most important products we offer
    is the Jobs Homepage, which serves as a central place for members with job-seeking
    intent to find good jobs to apply for.  Figure 1 is a snapshot of the LinkedIn
    Jobs Homepage. One of the main modules on the page is “Jobs you may be interested
    in,” where relevant job thumbnails are recommended to members based on their public
    profile data and past activities on the site. If a member is interested in a recommended
    job, she can click on it to go to the job detail page, where the original job
    post is shown with information such as the job title, description, responsibilities,
    required skills and qualifications. The job detail page also has an “apply” button
    which allows the member to apply for the job with one click, either on LinkedIn
    or on the website of the company posting the job. One of the key success metrics
    of LinkedIn’s jobs business is the total number of **job application clicks**
    (i.e. the number of clicks on the “apply” button).

    in the amount of data per member or job. There are new members to the site (hence
    almost no data) as well as members who have strong job search intent and applied
    for many jobs in the past. Similarly, for jobs, there are both popular and unpopular
    ones. For a member with many responses to different jobs in the past, we want
    to rely on the member-specific model. On the other hand, if the member does not
    have much past response data, we would like the member to fall back to the global
    model that captures the general behavior.

    Let *y[mjt]* denote the binary response of whether member *m* would apply for
    job *j* in context *t*, where the context usually includes the time and location
    where the job is shown. We use *q[m]* to denote the feature vector of member *m*,
    which includes the features extracted from the member''s public profile, e.g.
    the member''s title, job function, education history, industry, etc. We use *s[j]*
    to denote the feature vector of job *j*, which includes features extracted from
    the job post, e.g. the job title, desired skills and experiences, etc. Let *x[mjt]*
    represent the overall feature vector for the (*m, j, t*) triple, which can include
    *q[m]* and *s[j]* for feature-level main effects, the outer product between *q[m]*
    and *s[j]* for interactions among member and job features, and features of the
    context. We assume that *x[mjt]* does not contain member IDs or item IDs as features,
    because IDs will be treated differently from regular features. The GAME model
    for predicting the probability of member *m* applying for job *j* using logistic
    regression is:'

    ***fixed effect*** coefficients in the statistical literature), and *α[m]* and
    *β[j]* are the coefficient vectors specific to member *m* and job *j*, respectively.
    *α[m]* and *β[j]* are called ***random effect coefficients***, which capture member
    *m*'s personal preference on different item features and job *j*'s attraction
    for different member features. For a member *m* with many responses to different
    items in the past, we are able to accurately estimate her personal coefficient
    vector *α[m]* and provide personalized predictions. On the other hand, if member
    *m* does not have much past response data, the posterior mean of *α[m]* will be
    close to zero, and the model for member *m* will fall back to the global fixed
    effect component *x'[mjt]b*. The same behavior applies to the per-job coefficient
    vector *β[j]*.

- en: To train a model using a large amount of data on a Hadoop cluster, we developed
    Photon-ML on top of Apache Spark. One main challenge in designing a scalable algorithm
    is that the number of model parameters to be learned from the data is huge (e.g.
    tens of billions). If we naively train the model using standard machine learning
    methods (e.g. MLlib provided by Spark), the network communication cost for updating
    the large number of parameters is too high to be computationally feasible. The
    large number of parameters mainly comes from user-specific and job-specific models.
    As a result, the key to making the algorithm scalable is to avoid communicating
    or broadcasting the large number of parameters in the user-specific and job-specific
    models to the cluster.

- en: We solve the large-scale model training problem by applying parallel block-wise
    coordinate descent (PBCD), which iteratively trains the global model, user-specific
    models and job-specific models in turns until convergence. The global model is
    trained using a standard distributed gradient descent method. For the user-specific
    models and job-specific models, we designed a model parameter update scheme such
    that the parameters in the user-specific and job-specific models do not need to
    be communicated across machines in the cluster. Instead, a partial score per training
    example is communicated across machines. This significantly reduced the communicate
    cost. PBCD can be easily applied to models with different kinds of sub-models.

    recommendations. Many intriguing optimization and implementation details have
    been skipped due to the length limitation of this article. We highly recommend
    our readers to check out the open-sourced Photon-ML repo. At LinkedIn, we are
    committed to building state-of-the-art recommendation systems. We have made exciting
    plans for Photon-ML. In the near future, we are planning to add more modeling
    capabilities to Photon-ML, including tree models and different deep learning algorithms
    to capture non-linear and deeper representation structures.
