- en: This is it. This is the complete [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for machine
    learning and deep learning that you've been looking for. It's thorough. It's informative.
    It's relevant. And it's absolutely free.

    from freeCodeCamp is put together by machine learning stalwart [Daniel Bourke](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8O8l5cCX85Oem1d18EezQ).
    You might know Daniel from his prolific online presence over the past number of
    years, where he has blogged and created content related to machine learning for
    some time now.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This chapter covers introductory topics, including an intro to PyTorch, deep
    learning, getting set up for the course, and an intro to the basic building block
    of deep learning, tensors, and their basic functionality.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This chapter gets into PyTorch, and introduces its workflow. You learn about
    models, train a model, evaluate a model, and save and load a model. You also write
    the code to do all of this as you go, learning by doing.

    covered: inputs and outputs, classification neural networks architecture, converting
    data into tensors, loss, optimizers, evaluation, and more.'

- en: 4\. Computer Vision
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This chapter moves on to computer vision (CV), covering convolution neural networks
    (CNNs), obtaining CV datasets, using PyTorch DataLoaders, training CNNs, and training
    on the GPU.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This chapter covers creating your own datasets, the considerations involved,
    how to do so practically, converting images to tensors, data augmentation, baseline
    models on custom data, and more.

    and how to use it for deep learning. Daniel has done a commendable job of packing
    so much info into such a wide-ranging course, and he should be lauded for the
    work that went into such a robust course.
