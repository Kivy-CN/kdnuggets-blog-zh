    across [Data science](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/11/top-python-data-science-libraries.html),
    [Deep Learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/11/top-python-deep-learning-libraries.html)
    and [Machine Learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/10/top-python-machine-learning-libraries.html).
    As the year draws to a close, we thought we’d give you a special Christmas gift,
    and collate these into a KDnuggets official top Python libraries in 2018.
