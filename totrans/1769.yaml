    time, it comes as no surprise that the book delivers on its titular promise. This
    *is* data science for the layman, and the often-complex math -- which the book
    describes at a high level -- is intentionally not covered in detail. But don''t
    be misled: this does not mean that the contents are in any way watered down. In
    fact, the information contained within is robust, with its strength being that
    it is abridged and concise."'
