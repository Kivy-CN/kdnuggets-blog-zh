    covering a text with a name that speaks for itself, **[Foundations of Data Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book%20no%20so;utions%20March%202019.pdf)**,
    written by Avrim Blum, John Hopcroft, and Ravindran Kannan. A book with a such
    a name is making a pretty big statement. Luckily, its content backs it up.

    data science book. Neither its chapters nor their progression fit the mold of
    a standard contemporary data science text in my view. You can see, from the table
    of contents listed below, that the text really surveys a wide array of disparate
    topics, as opposed to simply creating an equivalency between data science and
    machine learning, for example, and progressing as such:'

    space, subspaces, and random walks or Markov Chains, reinforces this survey style.
    This also makes me think of another classic book in data science with which you
    may be familiar, [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/). Stressing
    that this text focuses on "foundation," you won't find the latest neural network
    architectures covered herein. However, if you want to eventually be able to understand
    the whys and hows of some of these more complex approaches to data science problem
    solving, you should find Foundations of Data Science useful.

    gradients descent, data sampling; these are all concepts that will serve you well
    later, when it comes to solving data science problems, and they are all essential
    building blocks to implementing more complex approaches as well. You won't be
    able to understand neural networks without gradient descent. You can't analyze
    social media networks without graph theory. The models you build won't be of value
    if you can't understand when and why you would sample from data.

    of Statistical Learning](/2020/05/elements-statistical-learning-free-ebook.html)
    and [Understanding Machine Learning](/2020/06/understanding-machine-learning-free-ebook.html)),
    this book is unabashedly theoretical. There is no code. There are no Python libraries
    being leaned on. There is no hand-waviness. There are only thorough explanations
    leading to understanding of these varied topics, should you spend the necessary
    time reading.

- en: While traditional areas of computer science remain highly important, increasingly
    researchers of the future will be involved with using computers to understand
    and extract usable information from massive data arising in applications, not
    just how to make computers useful on specific well-defined problems. With this
    in mind we have written this book to cover the theory we expect to be useful in
    the next 40 years, just as an understanding of automata theory, algorithms, and
    related topics gave students an advantage in the last 40 years. One of the major
    changes is an increase in emphasis on probability, statistics, and numerical methods.

- en: In many contemporary books, data science has been reduced to a series of programming
    tools which, if mastered, promise to do the data science for you. There seems
    to be less emphasis on the underlying concepts and theory divorced from code.
    This book is a good example of the opposite to this trend, a book which will undoubtedly
    arm you with the theoretical knowledge necessary to approach a career in data
    science with a strong set of foundations.
