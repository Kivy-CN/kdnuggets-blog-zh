    and it remains as such for several reasons. For starters, companies collect a
    higher volume and more types of information than before, and representatives want
    insights from it.

    competitiveness, even in a challenging marketplace. Here are six industries hiring
    data scientists now that will likely continue doing so for the foreseeable future.

    top spot. Additionally, predictions anticipated the industry’s worth [to reach
    $105.2 billion](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/data-scientists-must-target-telecom-and-bfsi-for-better-career-prospects/)
    in 2023, up from $59 billion in 2019\. In one example, the South African brand
    Telkom [creates opportunities for women to work](https://www.techfinancials.co.za/2021/08/23/women-data-scientists-help-lead-telkoms-digital-revolution/)

    to decide when and where to roll out 5G technology. They could also begin analyzing
    trends in customer service calls to detect and troubleshoot common problems.

    expertise, too. Government officials in the United Kingdom recently [announced

    location data’s potential. The belief is that the information could support electric
    car charging infrastructure, reduce emissions impacts, and make traveling safer
    and more pleasant, among other things.

    rely on public transit services. Authorities in Los Angeles have taken that approach.
    Data scientists can help decision-makers glean valuable details from the collected
    information.

- en: People in the health insurance sector are more interested in hiring data scientists,
    too. Doing that helps them stay on top of emerging trends, such as the growing
    interest in self-insurance plans. For example, statistics show that [29.2% of
    mid-sized employers chose](https://paretohealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Competitive_Advantage_for_Brokers.pdf)
    self-insurance options. Data scientists can assess how that changes, as well as
    track other notable patterns.

    more or less likely to file claims or which areas of the country have the most
    customers. Data science can answer those questions and others.

    too. In one example, Bank of America analyzed more than [41,000 social media comments
    and found](https://www.techerati.com/features-hub/opinions/how-big-data-has-revolutionised-the-finance-industry/)
    thousands of false rumors about purchase limits. Representatives could then give
    clarification to prevent reputational damage.

    They do the same when deciding whether to extend loan offers to customers. Some
    banking customers also benefit from data analytics, such as if app features tell
    them they’ll likely spend more than usual in a given month.

    of the available information could help cater to customers’ needs. For example,
    one holiday shopping study showed people searched for the term “gift box” [1.85
    times more often during](https://rehack.com/featured/investor-insight/how-could-you-use-big-data-in-business/)
    a two-year span than at other times. Those results help retailers tweak what they
    offer.

    likely drive data scientist hiring campaigns in retail. The pandemic changed how
    people shop and what they prefer to buy. Data experts will be crucial in finding
    these new trends and giving retail executives the statistics they need to act
    and increase profits.

    too. Elaine O’Dwyer works with Accenture as a data scientist in life science.
    “Projects generally focus on applying advanced analytics across the life sciences
    industry, often coupled with data and analytics strategy design. Most work done
    by our Ireland-based team [relates to the manufacturing and supply](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/people/data-and-life-sciences-elaine-o-dwyer-accenture)
    of commercial pharmaceutical products, for example, scheduling optimization to
    drive greater productivity and efficiency in the quality control lab,” she said.

    sectors will likely realize that data is crucial for dealing with the additional
    pressure that a global pandemic brings. Data will also aid these companies in
    developing new drugs, reducing errors, and minimizing recalls, whether for COVID-19
    treatments or otherwise.

    this year and beyond. Today’s executives want to move away from their former practices
    of primarily relying on gut instinct and experience when making decisions. Data
    scientists have the knowledge and skills to reveal insights that may otherwise
    get overlooked, making them valuable to virtually any industry.
