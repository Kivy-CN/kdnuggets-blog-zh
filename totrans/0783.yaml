- en: GitHub has long been the go-to platform for developers, including those in the
    data science community. It offers robust version control and collaboration features.
    However, data scientists often have unique requirements, such as handling large
    datasets, complex workflows, and specific collaboration needs that GitHub may
    not fully cater to. This has led to the rise of alternative platforms, each offering
    distinctive features and advantages.
