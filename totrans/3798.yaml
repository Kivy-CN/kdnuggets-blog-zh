    by James Clear. It got me thinking about how psychology influences our daily lives.
    As a coder, I started to think of ways to harness these insights to create a coding
    regime that actually works. Trust me, if we can somehow master the art of our
    minds and how our brain learns, it can be a game-changer. After careful research
    and observation, I devised these 5 steps to sculpt an effective coding routine.
    Let us go through them one by one and witness how psychology can transform your
    coding experience:'

    the importance of incremental progress and developing consistency over time. Inspired
    by the idea, I dedicated a mere fraction of my time (15 minutes) to coding. Although
    it seems trivial, it can pave the way for consistency. Our brain considers it
    less daunting and over a while, we start to gain confidence. It''s like planting
    the seeds of progress that grows over time. You are not chasing perfection - you
    are embracing progress. Let me explain this to you mathematically:'

    and my brain said "Hey, it's coding time!".  I immersed myself in the coding followed
    by the sense of progress that I got from solving the coding challenge or decoding
    a problem. It was a mini victory that made it easier for me to re-enter this coding
    cycle.

    reminded me it was time to code. So, while your water boils for tea, open your

    think. They act as environmental cues subtly guiding our actions. Considering
    its importance, I dedicated a separate coding space for myself — a turning point
    in my journey. The absence of distractions and the intentional setup instantly
    put me in the coding mindset. Whenever my brain used to look at my workspace it
    knows that it's coding time now. This step heightened my concentration.

- en: Intrinsic motivation is closely tied to rewards. Rewards trigger the brain’s
    pleasure centers releasing dopamine, a chemical known for generating the feeling
    of pleasure. To reward myself, I set up some milestones and started celebrating
    each step of my progress by having a special meal. Pick projects that excite you.
    When you're curious, coding feels like an adventure, not a chore. Also, try to
    share your progress with others and surround yourself with positive people. Their
    feedback and words of encouragement can further strengthen your coding journey.
