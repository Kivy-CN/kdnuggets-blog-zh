    and professional lives. On top of it, lo and behold, something like artificial
    intelligence starts to gather steam and you learn that your skillset is getting
    terribly outdated over next two years.

    It is a great place to begin but I found it hard to stay awake for long. Not to
    say that the course was bad or anything, but I really suck at staying attentive
    in lectures. My mode of learning has always been by doing, so I thought why the
    hell not, let’s implement our own neural network.

    stacks just yet. So I searched for a simple neural net module called nn and used
    it to implement an *AND *gate with a dummy input. [Inspired by this tutorial](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1),
    I chose the problem that for any three inputs X,Y and Z the output should by X *AND *Y.

    of data and it adjusts its internal parameters in such a way that it gains the

    of a team winning a Cricket match. Learning AI is not like learning a web framework.
