    the commonly asked questions – why do we need to learn linear algebra in the first
    place? How does it relate to data science and machine learning concepts?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning algorithms typically require knowledge of scalar, vectors,
    and matrices to compute loss functions, eigenvalues, covariance matrix, etc. Further,
    linear algebra is also used extensively in neural networks,  regularization techniques,
    recommender systems, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA), etc.

    part is that all the listed courses are free of cost and ranked from beginner-level
    to more advanced concepts. While the ML community keeps questioning if it is essential
    to learn linear algebra to get started with machine learning, I would highly recommend
    following a more agile approach to keep iterating and referring to these courses
    as you chart out your ML algorithmic journey.
