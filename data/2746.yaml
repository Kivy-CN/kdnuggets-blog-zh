- en: Tom and I collaborated closely for much of my career. We started working together
    in 1994, when I joined what's now Verizon (then NYNEX Science and Technology).
    My initial impression was that Tom was a curmudgeon (yes, even back then), and
    I had some doubts about what working with him would be like. Very soon I realized
    that beneath this impression he was a kind, thoughtful, caring guy, as well as
    a brilliant data scientist. He was my main day-to-day professional partner up
    until we both left for other jobs in late 1999\. That was a magical half decade.
    Tom was the sort of collaborator where one afternoon we would adjourn our meeting
    with a set of items for each to do, and when we got together the next day Tom
    would have done all of his *plus* several more crucial things that had come up
    in the process. That was the case even if in the intervening evening we had gone
    out to see some 90s neo-punk or heavy alt rock band, which we liked to do. Because
    of this, *I* had to double down--I wasn't going to be the slacker on the team.
    Without any doubt I did substantially better work because I was working with Tom
    than I would have done on my own.

  zh: 汤姆和我在我职业生涯的大部分时间里紧密合作。我们从1994年开始合作，那时我加入了现在的Verizon（当时是NYNEX科技）。我最初的印象是汤姆是个脾气古怪的人（是的，即使在那时也是如此），我对与他合作会是什么样子有些怀疑。很快我意识到，在这种印象下，他实际上是一个善良、体贴、关怀的人，同时也是一个杰出的数据科学家。在我们都离开去找其他工作之前的1999年底，这段时间是魔幻的五年。汤姆是那种合作伙伴，我们一个下午会结束会议，制定一系列各自需要完成的任务，当我们第二天再次见面时，汤姆已经完成了他的*加上*几个在过程中出现的重要任务。即使在此期间的晚上，我们出去看了某个90年代的新人朋克或重型另类摇滚乐队（这是我们喜欢做的事情），这种情况也是如此。正因为如此，*我*不得不更加努力——我不想成为团队中的拖后腿者。毫无疑问，因为和汤姆一起工作，我做的工作明显比自己单独完成的要好。
- en: 'My favorite "Tom story" is from those days. Tom and I were involved with a
    project where the higher ups needed to make a decision on how to deal with the
    increasingly visible poor service the company was providing. Ideally, they would
    liked to have shown that the problem was to a large extent due to the prior year''s
    high humidity, since everyone knows that telecom equipment suffers in high humidity.
    In perhaps my favorite professional moment, Tom presented the results of the data
    analysis (which he had done): "Humidity does not seem to have a significant effect
    on problems in the network. And oh by the way, it wasn''t more humid last year."
    (I recently asked Tom whether his recollection of that incident concurred with
    mine, and he said that he liked the way I told it, so yes. :-) Incidentally, we
    then followed up this analysis with a root-cause analysis. Based on those results
    we then built a model to predict the impact of individual network rehabilitation
    actions. The model integrated tens of thousands of locally focused regressions.
    We were told that our model''s predictions were used to direct a billion-dollar
    rehab campaign. A retrospective evaluation after the rehab showed that our predictions
    were almost perfect, and we won the company''s President''s Award. That put a
    self-satisfied smile on my face. Tom said that the evaluation overestimated how
    accurate our model really was. :-)'

  zh: '我最喜欢的“汤姆故事”来自那些日子。汤姆和我参与了一个项目，高层需要决定如何处理公司提供的越来越明显的糟糕服务。理想情况下，他们希望能证明问题在很大程度上是由于前一年的高湿度，因为大家都知道电信设备在高湿度下会受到影响。在我最喜欢的职业时刻之一，汤姆展示了数据分析的结果（是他完成的）：”湿度似乎对网络问题没有显著影响。而且顺便提一下，去年并没有更潮湿。”（我最近问汤姆他是否记得这件事的方式与我一致，他说他喜欢我讲述的方式，所以是的。:-)
    顺便说一下，我们随后跟进了这项分析，并进行了根本原因分析。根据这些结果，我们建立了一个模型来预测单个网络恢复行动的影响。这个模型集成了数万次本地回归。我们被告知，我们模型的预测被用于指导一项价值十亿美元的恢复活动。恢复后的回顾显示，我们的预测几乎是完美的，我们获得了公司的总统奖。这让我的脸上露出了自满的微笑。汤姆说，评估高估了我们模型的真实准确性。:-) '
- en: I was lucky and blessed to have gotten to spend so much time with Tom. As he
    continued his work melding data science and practice at several California-based
    companies over the next twenty years, we continued to write together. And across
    3000 miles, he and I would debate just about any topic, whether it was important
    or not. I'll miss that the most. Love you Tom.
