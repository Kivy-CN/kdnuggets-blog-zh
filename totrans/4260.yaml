- en: When working in Jupyter Notebooks it is convenient to store your functions and
    classes in separate .py files and just import them. This makes your notebooks
    readable, and you can easily reuse the same functions and classes in several notebooks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assume, you started your notebook, imported custom functions from .py files,
    loaded large datasets, and did some preprocessing using your custom functions.
    And it turns out that one of the functions for preprocessing is incorrect, so
    you fix the code in .py files, then run the cell with preprocessing once again
    – and… nothing changes, the same error is there. Jupyter Notebook does not see
    an updated version of the function.

    all the datasets already loaded to memory.

    go back to the notebook and run cell with preprocessing. All functions in notebook
    imports are reloaded to their latest versions, code in the cell is executed –
    and you see how the fixed function works.'
