    perhaps for obvious reasons. The trick, of course, if being able to find the real
    world data needed for a project. Sometimes you get lucky the data you need is
    available at your fingertips, in the form you need, and in the amount you want.

- en: Often, however, real world data isn't enough for a project. In such a case,
    synthetic data can be used either in place of real data or to augment an insufficiently
    large dataset. There are lots of ways to artificially manufacture data, some of
    which are far more complex than others. There are a number of relatively simple
    options for doing so, however, and **[Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)**
    for Python is one such solution.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Faker constructor takes a performance-related argument called `use_weighting`.
    It specifies whether to attempt to have the frequency of values match real-world
    frequencies (e.g. the English name Gary would be much more frequent than the name
    Lorimer). If `use_weighting` is `False`, then all items have an equal chance of
    being selected, and the selection process is much faster. The default is `True`.

    international company, we want to emulate real world distribution of naming, and
    we want to save this data to a CSV file for later use in a data science task of
    some sort. To clean up the data, we will also replace the newlines in the generated
    addresses with commas, and remove the newlines from generated text completely.
