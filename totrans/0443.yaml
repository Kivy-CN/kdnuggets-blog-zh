    both in terms of applications and job opportunities. Whether you’re considering
    entering the field, already [have your first data science job](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-get-a-data-science-job-the-ultimate-guide/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdnuggets),

    developed at the lower levels. It’s a good idea to look at the skills needed and
    the tasks you’ll be expected to handle at the level above where you are now. By
    looking for opportunities within your work to develop those skills, you can demonstrate
    your value when you go for your next promotion.

    or below one another. When I worked in data science, my more senior coworker’s
    job wasn’t too different from mine, but they handled much more complex projects.
    Our boss was on another level, and the higher up the management chain you go,
    the less likely it is that you’ll be expected to or that you’ll have the opportunity
    to do technical work, like implementing models. This pattern holds true for a
    lot of the tech world, and data science is no exception.

    deal directly with data and models. Once you start managing others though, get
    ready to swap hats. You’ll have to interact a lot more with people - both the
    people who report to you and partner teams or customers. A big part of data science
    is turning business goals or requirements into data-driven insights, so you have
    to talk to different teams on the business side to understand the problem.
