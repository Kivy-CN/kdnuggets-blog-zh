    pathway and the self-study pathway.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Traditional College Degree Pathway:** Several top universities offer traditional
    graduate-level programs in data science. Because these are graduate-level programs,
    most will require an undergraduate degree in an analytical field such as physics,
    mathematics, accounting, business, computer science, or engineering. These programs
    typically have a duration of 3 to 4 semesters for those who pursue full-time enrollment.
    Traditional programs come in different flavors, such as: Data Science Master’s,
    Data Analytics Master’s, or Business Analytics Masters. The cost of tuition for
    traditional face-to-face programs could be anywhere in the range of $15,000 to
    $40,000, not including living expenses. For online data science master’s programs,
    the cost could be anywhere from $12,000 to $40,000.  The links below examine top
    MS degrees, online, in Europe, and US/Canada, with ranking, tuition, and more.'

    at a graduate school). This will give you a deeper understanding of the field
    of data science, but if your circumstances don’t allow you to pursue a college
    degree, you can (with some passion and dedication) teach yourself data science
    through self-study. There are so many excellent online data science courses on
    platforms such as edX, Coursera, DataCamp, Udacity, and Udemy. By dedicating some
    time, you can learn the fundamentals of data science from these courses. The self-study
    pathway is thus very affordable compared to the college degree pathway.'

    are 100% free, while some do require you to pay a subscription fee (which could
    range anywhere from $50 to $200 per course or more, varies from platforms to platforms).
    Keep in mind that gaining expertise in any discipline requires an enormous amount
    of time and energy. So, do not be in a rush. Make sure that if you decide to enroll
    in a course, you should be ready to complete the entire course, including all
    assignments and homework problems. Some of the quizzes and homework assignments
    will be quite challenging. However, keep in mind that if you don’t challenge yourself,
    you won’t be able to grow in your knowledge and skills.
