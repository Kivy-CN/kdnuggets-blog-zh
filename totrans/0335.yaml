    learning data science concepts. And even in the process of learning, the concepts,
    tools, techniques, and libraries that you need to learn can be overwhelming.

    However most aspiring data professionals tend to focus more on the *learning*
    and overlook this step of building a portfolio of interesting projects—the *applying*
    part.

    your proficiency, it's not possible to convince recruiters of your expertise.
  prefs: []

    to showcase projects, most learners do not build a portfolio. You probably use
    GitHub repository—with an informative README file—to track changes to your project’s
    code. However, to build out a data science portfolio showcasing your projects,
    you can check out other [free platforms such as Kaggle and DataSciencePortfol.io](/5-free-platforms-for-building-a-strong-data-science-portfolio).

    In addition to working on your technical skills and building projects (yes, your
    portfolio), you also want to build your online presence. So that recruiters can

    and then solving problems on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
    If you are running short of time, you can work through a problem set such as [Blind
    75](https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/). This problem set contains questions
    across all major concepts like arrays, dynamic programming, strings, graphs, and
    more.
