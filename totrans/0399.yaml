    without any?

    similar things. You end up getting stuck in a trap where you aren’t really learning
    anything new, you just feel like you are.

    probably doing wrong:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. You Are Taking Too Many Online Courses
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every time you take a new online course that’s made for beginners and add it
    to your resume, you are telling employers that you are new to the field. This
    makes it seem like you lack experience, and can do more harm than good to your
    portfolio.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve seen many data science candidates list over ten similar online courses
    on their resume with no projects or real-world applications that demonstrate the
    skills they learned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here’s what you should do instead
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take one or two data science online courses and create projects based on the
    skills gained. If you find that you lack expertise in specific areas while building
    these projects, then take a course that bridges the gap in your knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This way, you not only learn faster but can display a wide variety of skill
    sets on your resume instead of listing ten courses that teach the same thing.
  prefs: []

- en: 2\. You Don't Stand Out From the Crowd
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another mistake most applicants make is that they list the same types of projects
    on their resumes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Projects like Iris Flower Classification and Titanic Survival Prediction are
    extremely popular.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to their simplicity, these are the first projects most people create when
    learning data science. If you add them to your resume, you are telling employers
    that you lack experience and creativity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hundreds of other applicants have created the same project and mentioned it
    in their portfolios. Why should you get the job offer when your resume is no different
    from 80% of other data science aspirants out there?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here’s what you should do instead
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Create data science projects that showcase a variety of skills, such as data
    analysis, machine learning, and data preprocessing. If you need inspiration to
    create unique projects that stand out, take a look at [5 of my best data science
    portfolio projects](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-of-my-best-data-science-portfolio-projects-8cd7f81f1b1).

    unlike Kaggle datasets that are already structured and preprocessed.

    collecting data through an API or [web scraping](/2022/02/build-web-scraper-python-5-minutes.html)

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many job seekers tend to cold submit their resumes to every open data science
    job posting, thinking that it will increase their chances of landing employment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, doing this actually reduces your odds of getting a job. It is likely
    that you will either get a generic rejection email or no response at all from
    the companies you applied to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is because you are applying without considering what the company is actually
    looking for. Every open position is unique, and different companies hire data
    scientists for different reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, an eCommerce company might hire a data scientist in their marketing
    department to build a recommender system that encourages customers to make more
    purchases on the site.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, a tech company may hire a data scientist to help their product
    team introduce new features and measure product success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the job title is “Data Scientist” for both of these roles, their job scopes
    vary. If you apply to each job posting with the same resume without taking the
    company’s use case into consideration, it shows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here’s what you should do instead
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Select a handful of companies you want to apply to. Read about them and do some
    research on the kind of industry they operate in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, try creating projects that are relevant to this industry. This tells hiring
    managers that you will add value to them since you have worked on projects that
    are similar to their use cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can even go a step further and reach out to data scientists who already
    work in the company you want to join. Connect with them on LinkedIn or via email,
    and try to get an idea about the kinds of projects they are involved in.
  prefs: []

    other applicants.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A few months ago, an aspiring data scientist reached out to me. She wanted to
    land a job in data science but was unable to do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I reviewed her resume and realized the problem immediately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This applicant came from a marketing background and had only been to one data
    science Bootcamp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The skills she had highlighted on her resume included programming, machine learning,
    and statistics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any employer reading that resume would have been able to tell that her knowledge
    in the above subjects was limited since there is only so much you can learn from
    a 3-month Bootcamp.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here’s what she should have done instead
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This applicant’s strength lay in her marketing domain knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a background in marketing, she should have created projects relevant to
    marketing analytics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most marketing experts cannot deal with large amounts of data. They lack technical
    and analytical skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since she already possessed domain expertise in marketing, all she had to do
    was pick up some Python, Excel, and SQL skills. Then, she should have created
    a few marketing data analytics projects using these tools and included them in
    her portfolio.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This would have easily landed her a job in analytics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, after one or two years of experience in the field, she could have made
    the transition from data analytics to data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science is a field that requires knowledge of applied statistics, along
    with strong analytical and programming capabilities. For most people, it is difficult
    to get a data science job right away without formal qualifications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to this, it makes sense to first break into a field with a lower barrier
    of entry like data engineering or analytics, then gradually make the transition
    into data science.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    same company, and am now working as a forecasting analyst at an MNC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I got these jobs not because I was the most qualified candidate applying to
    these positions, but because I demonstrated a genuine interest in the field. Employers
    look for applicants who are passionate about the work they do, since skills can
    be developed over time.
  prefs: []

    posts about them. I published my work on my [data science blog](https://www.natasshaselvaraj.com/)

    of my best projects in the “Projects” section of my resume and wrote a few lines
    about them.

    the field, which helped me create bigger and more interesting projects. As I continued
    to publish my work online, employers started reaching out to me for [freelance
    projects](/2022/02/become-successful-data-science-freelancer-2022.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was hired to collect large amounts of data for companies, build machine learning
    models, perform market research, and engage in freelance writing projects. All
    these gigs were on top of my day job as a data scientist.

    There are many skilled people out there who never get discovered because employers
