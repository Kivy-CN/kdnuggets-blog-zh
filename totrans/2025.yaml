- en: The “modern data stack” has gotten a lot of press recently in the data blogosphere.
    And for good reason - it’s a useful model for identifying the tools you need to
    build an [effective data org](https://databand.ai/blog/dataops-org-structure/).
  prefs: []

- en: Let’s say you just invested huge amounts of time and treasure in brand new tools
    to run your data infra. But your tools don’t line up with the modern stack described.
    You’re using a bunch of other tools, and don’t recognize all those logos. Locked
    out of the “modern stack”, you might be led to believe that your data operations
    will creep to a halt as it crumbles under the weight of its unshakable decrepitude.
    Or that you’ll never find and hire new engineers willing to tolerate your antiquated
    data platform.
  prefs: []

- en: None of that is likely true. The truth is that the “modern stack” has been too
    narrowly defined for only a certain kind of data organization. For many data teams,
    you need to be thinking about your stack differently.

    required to help a large swath of organizations do what they need done. But if
    you don’t fit this mold, does it mean your team is not “modern”? Of course not!
    While these tools cover the needs of many, they don’t tell the whole story. It’s
    missing a critical layer of core data platform services that many teams simply
    cannot function without.

    “modern data stack” you need depends on your company’s strategy and the nature
    of your data products. The type of stack you chose will inform the stressors (sources
    of failure) in your data platform and your definitions of [data quality](https://databand.ai/blog/what-is-good-data-quality-for-data-engineers/).

    engineering**. DBT Labs offers a great description of the role [here](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/).
    If you look at the data industry more holistically, you can see two diverging
    movements around the “modern data stack.”

- en: One is, you guessed it, the modern data stack for analytics engineering. This
    version of the MDS is optimized for accessibility, ease of use, and centralization
    of work (“T”) in the warehouse. It’s often thought of with a “no-code” approach
    to build.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other version we see teams pursue is a modern data stack optimized for engineering.
    This version of the MDS is designed for flexibility, control, and scalability.

- en: This is the type of modern data stack that dominates discussion around the topic.
    Data platforms in this category are usually low-code and SQL-oriented. As such,
    data teams will consist mostly of data analysts and analytics engineers with fewer
    data engineers (possibly no data engineers depending on the size of the organization).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Teams working in this paradigm are less dependent on data engineers to ingest
    and ready their data. They have a smaller number of commonly used data sources
    that can be wholly ingested by platforms like Fivetran and Stitch. If data engineers
    exist, they will be responsible for maintaining the data platform as a whole and
    occasionally a custom integration. Everything to the left of the warehouse is
    more simple and doesn’t require deep engineering attention.

- en: When there is complexity, it will arise from the internal content of data flows,
    but more so from how users query and analyze the data. As such, many of the data
    issues and failures will be due to SQL and dashboard errors. Analysts will mainly
    interface with the analytics engineers who are responsible for aggregating data
    in the warehouse and providing documentation to improve end-user accessibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This platform is nimble and will make it easy to get started quickly. The skills
    needed to manage it are easier to learn (SQL, GUI-based tools) so it’s a quick,
    lean way to get an analytics program off of the ground. As an example, this model
    is perfect for when business stakeholders want constant and ad hoc analysis done
    on Salesforce data so they can make decisions quickly.

    range of sources to build their data products. These teams build a lot of IP in
    how they process and generate insights or models from unique data sets. They deal
    with more unique and varied data sources (csv, parquest, json), and do heavier
    processing of data to make it all fit together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These teams require more specialized skills on top of analytics engineering
    to get all the data needed into the analytics-ready form. Data engineers are necessary
    to bring control, flexibility, and firepower for ingestion, preparation, and delivery
    of data to analysts and scientists. To provide those layers of flexibility and
    control, these teams use code-oriented architectures; Python and custom pipeline
    build outs. As a result of this complexity and the variety of data sources, we
    will see a fan-out architecture to the left of the warehouse, in the ingestion
    and pre-processing layers, which introduces more points of failure and the need
    for specialized tools to enforce data reliability across a huge number of data
    sources and possible causes of failure.
