- en: My recommended next step is the following. Get a good ML book (my list below),
    read the first intro chapters, and then jump to whatever chapter includes an algorithm
    you are interested. Once you have found that algo, dive into it, understand all
    the details, and, especially, implement it. In the previous online course you
    would already have implemented some algorithms in Octave. But, here I am talking
    about implementing an algorithm from scratch in a "real" programming language.
    You can still start with an easy one such as L2-regularized Logistic Regression,
    or k-means, but you should also push yourself to implement more interesting ones
    such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) or SVMs.

    Run algorithms for every chapter in the above book. Advantage with Scikit is it
    gives you some sample data too to test.

    in Quora or Kaggle exercises etc will help you in getting up to the speed. Also
    you can get this book The Elements of Statistical Learning. I haven't seen anyone
    disappointed with this one. It's a bit of math but self explanatory mostly.

- en: It is easy to get lost in all the languages and technologies that allow one
    to practice machine learning on real-world data. They allow us to execute our
    ideas and build our models. When integrated into real applications they engender
    software with the ability to learn and distill high-dimensional problems down
    to focused results. But languages and technology come and go. Knowing R or Python
    really well might amount to building a model faster or allow you to integrate
    it into software better, but it says nothing about your ability choose the right
    model, or build one that truly speaks to the challenge at hand. The art of being
    able to do machine learning well comes from seeing the core concepts inside the
    algorithms and how they overlap with the pain points trying to be addressed. Great
    practitioners start to see interesting overlaps before ever touching a keyboard.

    up to its name. With top level categories such as learning algorithms, databases,
    data cleaning, and languages, a sufficiently broad and deep ontology of data science
    terms are presented and explained, with links to relevant resources.

- en: Xavier points out that machine learning is about breadth *and* depth, and balancing
    the learning of both is important. He suggests surveying the basics of the most
    important algorithms, but also learning the low-level details of as many as possible.
    Xavier also links to his answer to '[What are the top 10 data mining or machine
    learning algorithms?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-data-mining-or-machine-learning-algorithms/answer/Xavier-Amatriain)'
    to help drive home his point of learning the most important algorithms, a question
    thread that is a useful resource in its own right.

- en: Sean also says to "think like a researcher," as the pursuit of a PhD trains
    students in the discipline of advanced research. A PhD holder is able to confidently
    state that they have solved an original problem and defended that solution to
    others in the field. According to Sean, Non-PhDs can model their approach to machine
    learning after PhDs by embodying this mentality of 'research thought.'

- en: To balance Sean's views on the importance of research, Raviteja stresses practice.
    He rightfully states that all the theory in the world is useless if you can't
    make an educated selection between algorithms when it comes time to implement
    a model. He advises picking up scikit-learn (though R would also suffice) and
    gaining real world experience of tackling problems, choosing appropriate algorithms,
    and building models that have a purpose.
