- en: Machine learning (ML) is the motor that drives data science. Each ML method
    (also called an algorithm) takes in data, turns it over, and spits out an answer.
    ML algorithms do the part of data science that is the trickiest to explain and
    the most fun to work with. That’s where the mathematical magic happens.

    answer. These can help guide your thinking as you are formulating your razor sharp
    question.

    family is formally known as **two-class classification**. It’s useful for any
    question that has just two possible answers: yes or no, on or off, smoking or
    non-smoking, purchased or not. Lots of data science questions sound like this
    or can be re-phrased to fit this form. It’s the simplest and most commonly asked
    data science question. Here are few typical examples.'

    implies, it answers a question that has several (or even many) possible answers:
    which flavor, which person, which part, which company, which candidate. Most multi-class
    classification algorithms are just extensions of two-class classification algorithms.
    Here are a few typical examples.'

- en: '![anomaly-detection-h2o](../Images/8e2012f5bc6ee0aaf360d69cad2ddd82.png)This
    family of algorithms performs **anomaly detection**. They identify data points
    that are not normal. If you are paying close attention, you noticed that this
    looks like a binary classification question. It can be answered yes or no. The
    difference is that binary classification assumes you have a collection of examples
    of both yes and no cases. Anomaly detection doesn’t. This is particularly useful
    when what you are looking for occurs so rarely that you haven’t had a chance to
    collect many examples of it, like equipment failures. It’s also very helpful when
    there is a lot of variety in what constitutes “not normal,” as there is in credit
    card fraud detection.  Here are some typical anomaly detection questions.'
