    people have been using ChatGPT for several months now, with many success stories.
    With many [users across 22 countries](https://openai.com/blog/insights-from-global-conversations),
    OpenAI has been working on fine-tuning its models to understand diverse contexts
    and provide responses unique to the user. They have been taking into consideration
    user feedback, for example, the ability to start a ChatGPT conversation afresh
    and have been looking into solutions.

    that they are introducing new processes with custom instructions to tailor ChatGPT
    to your specific needs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new beta Custom Instructions feature has been developed to help users get
    the most out of ChatGPT by preventing them from repeating common instructions
    between chat sessions. Moving forward, ChatGPT will take into consideration users'
    custom instructions every time it produces a response. Users will not have to
    repeat themselves, and continuously tailor their preferences during the conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT will remember specific user preferences based on past multiple interactions,
    as well as allow users to set their individual preferences. Setting preferences
    will provide specific unique responses, without having to start a new conversation
    each time.
