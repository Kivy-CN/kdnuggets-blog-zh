    to learn about our world, succeed in our careers, and shape our future. It is
    found in the news, the web, laws, messaging services, and more. It is how we connect

- en: Now with the rapid evolution of technology, more and more companies are finding
    new ways to develop a computer's ability to learn and deal with language. This
    comes with the recent breakthrough of language processing technologies in artificial
    intelligence (AI).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These language-processing techniques are allowing companies to build intelligent
    systems that have a better understanding of language. These techniques are made
    from large pre-trained transformer language models or large language models -
    which have a more extensive ability and understanding of language and what these
    models need to do with the text.

- en: Looking at AI applications such as ChatGPT and Google Bard - they have the ability
    to summarise articles, help you write stories/comics, and engage in long human-like
    conversations. They can do a lot and this is all because of the large language
    models embedded.

- en: A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep-learning algorithm that can read, recognise,
    summarise, translate, predict and also generate text. Their ability to predict
    future words and construct a sentence allows them to learn how humans talk and
    write and be able to have conversations - just like humans!

    in sequential data, for example, words in a sentence. Transformer models use mathematical

- en: Transformer models use mathematical techniques, known as attention or self-attention.
    Attention is when a transformer model attends to different parts of another sequence,
    whereas self-attention is when a transformer model attends to different parts
    of the same input sequence.

    along with catering to meetings that are made up of a diverse group and include
    hearing-impaired attendees.

- en: In order to create a successful performing LLM, you will need large amounts
    of data. We can gauge this from the ‘Large’ in its name.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s take ChatGPT for example, the model needs to have enough data in order
    to understand everything you are asking. It takes all the data and text that is
    available on the internet over a large period. Allowing it to produce accurate
    and effective outputs for the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The algorithm uses unsupervised learning, where the model learns on unlabeled
    data, inferring more about the hidden structures to produce accurate and reliable
    outputs. Using this type of machine learning technique, the LLM learns about words,
    the construction of sentences, and the relationship between the words. This helps
    the LLM to learn more about language, context, grammar, and tone of language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Through this, the LLM can use this knowledge to predict and generate content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other techniques can be applied to LLMs to be used in specific tasks. For example,
    a model can be fine-tuned to be used for educational purposes around the history
    of the UK. Where the model will be fed small bits of data that focus on the history
    of the UK and train it for a specific application.

    More and more people will want to find new ways to unlock new opportunities and
    be innovative with LLM’s in areas such as code generation, healthcare, robotics,
    and more.
