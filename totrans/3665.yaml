- en: We’ve been seeing large language models (LLMs) spitting out every week, with
    more and more chatbots for us to use. However, it can be hard to figure out which
    is the best, the progress on each and which one is most useful.

- en: '[Falcon LLM](https://falconllm.tii.ae/) was Founded and built by the [Technology
    Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/) (TII), a company that is part of the
    Abu Dhabi Government’s Advanced Technology Research Council. The government oversees
    technology research in the whole of the United Arab Emirates, where the team of
    scientists, researchers and engineers focus on delivering transformative technologies
    and discoveries in science.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Falcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b) is a foundational LLM
    with 40B parameters, training on one trillion tokens. Falcon 40B is an autoregressive
    decoder-only model. An autoregressive decoder-only model means that the model
    is trained to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens.
    The GPT model is a good example of this.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The architecture of Falcon has been shown to significantly outperform GPT-3
    for only 75% of the training compute budget, as well as only requiring ? of the
    compute at inference time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data quality at scale was an important focus of the team at the Technology Innovation
    Institute, as we know that LLMs are highly sensitive to the quality of training
    data. The team built a data pipeline which scaled to tens of thousands of CPU
    cores for fast processing and was able to extract high-quality content from the
    web using extensive filtering and deduplication.

    which has 7B parameters, trained on 1,500B tokens. Aswell as a [Falcon-40B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct),

    [CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org/). The team went through a thorough filtering
    phase to remove machine-generated text, and adult content as well as any deduplication
    to produce a pretraining dataset of nearly five trillion tokens was assembled.
