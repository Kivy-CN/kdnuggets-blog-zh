    essentially the skill of prompting AI to assist in coding-related tasks. I’ve
    seen Andrej Karpathy joke on Twitter, “The hottest new programming language is
    English.”

    companies racing to develop an AI that can query the data warehouse and return
    an intelligent answer to the ad hoc questions data consumers ask in their natural
    language. "This would radically simplify the self-service analytics process and
    further democratize data, but it will be difficult to solve beyond basic "metric
    fetching," given the complexity of data pipelines for more advanced analytics,"
    commented Monte Carlo CTO [Shane Murray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanemurray5/).

    track record of making an impact and hitting the ground running," Murray mentioned.
    That could be in their primary occupation or by contributing to open-source projects.
    In either case, it’s not that you were there, but what impact did you make?'

    has escaped reinvention," Murray remarked. It’s clear that the process of building
    and maintaining data pipelines will become much easier, as will the ability for
    data consumers to access and manipulate data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, what hasn’t changed is the data lifecycle. "It is emitted, it is transformed
    for a use, and then it is archived," Murray pointed out. "While the underlying
    infrastructure may change and automation will shift time and attention to the
    right or left, human data engineers will continue to play a crucial role in extracting
    value from data, whether architecting scalable and reliable data systems or as
    specialist engineers within a chosen domain of data."

    of various sizes, are great places for data engineers to cut their teeth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Murray further explained, "Here, you can specialize in a specific domain of
    data that is central to the business operations, such as customer data or product
    / behavioral data. In this role, you should aim to gain an understanding of the
    end-to-end problem—from source to the analytical use case—as it'll make you an
    asset to the team and the business."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Alternatively, one might specialize in a specific capability of the data platform,
    such as reliability engineering, business intelligence, experimentation, or feature
    engineering." Murray specified. "These types of roles typically give a broader,
    but shallower, understanding of each business use case, but may be an easier jump
    from a software engineering role into data."'

    role, said Murray. If one is growing [data engineering skills](https://kanger.dev/article/data-engineer-skills)
    but finds they are more compelled by talking to end users, articulating the problems
    to be solved, and distilling the vision and roadmap for the team, then a product
    management role may be a future prospect.

    ranging from critical dashboards and decision-support tools to applications of
    machine learning that are critical to business operations or customer experience.
    "Great [data product managers](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-what-good-data-product-managers-do-and-why-you-probably-need-one/)
    will have an understanding of how to build a reliable and scalable data product,
    but also apply product thinking to drive the vision, roadmap, and adoption," Murray
    affirmed.

- en: The modern data stack is quickly becoming the dominant, trending tech stack
    in the data engineering field, Murray articulated. This stack has a cloud-based
    data warehouse or lake at the center and complementary cloud-based solutions for
    data ingestion, transformation, orchestration, visualization, and data observability.

    user-friendly than the prior generation of tools, is extensible to a wide range
    of analytical and machine learning use cases, and can scale to the size and complexity
    of data managed in today’s world.

    data use cases, but generally the most common modern data stack is Snowflake,
    Fivetran, dbt, Airflow, Looker, and Monte Carlo. There may also be Atlan and Immuta
    to address data catalog and access, respectively," Murray explained. "Larger organizations
    or those with more machine learning use cases will typically have data stacks
    that more heavily utilize Databricks and Spark."'

    reached a point of consolidation yet, and already we are seeing ideas that may
    further disrupt the status quo of modern data pipelines," Murray reflected. "On
    the near horizon are the more widespread adoption of streaming data, zero-ETL,
    data sharing, and a unified metrics layer." Zero-ETL and data sharing are particularly
    interesting as they have the potential to simplify the complexity of modern data
    pipelines, which have multiple points of integration and thus failure.'

    in 2023, driven by the growth of big data analytics. According to [Dice Media's
    analysis](https://www.dice.com/career-advice/techs-winning-and-losing-jobs-in-2023),
    this shift will occur as the global big data analytics market is expected to grow
    at an impressive rate of 30.7 percent, reaching a projected value of $346.24 billion
    by 2030\. This growth is anticipated to create numerous opportunities for skilled
    professionals in the field, such as data engineers, business analysts, and data
    analysts.

    code, but rather, they will involve more communication with business stakeholders
    and designing end-to-end systems," commented [Deexith Reddy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deexith-reddy-945a55aa),
    an experienced data engineer and open-source enthusiast. "Therefore, to ensure
    job security, one must focus on both the breadth of data analytics and the depth

    However, during our call, Reddy also emphasized that contributing to open-source
    projects will always be beneficial for building a strong portfolio, considering
    technological advancements and recent AI breakthroughs.

- en: Reddy shed further light on the critical role data engineers play in enhancing
    an organization's capabilities by utilizing open-source technologies. For instance,
    there has been widespread adoption of open-source technologies like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/),
    [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)
    among data engineers, as well as [Kubernetes](https://kanger.dev/tutorial/introduction-kubernetes-basics)
    among data scientists for data science practices. These OSS technologies help
    meet the computational requirements for deep learning and machine learning workloads,
    as well as MLOps workflows.

    like these, fostering an environment that values and encourages open-source contributions.
    This approach helps retain skilled data engineers and allows organizations to
