    With just a few prompts, it can generate a skeleton of the code I need, complete
    with my chosen technologies, frameworks, and versions. **Not only does it save
    me at least an hour or so of work each time**, but it also helps to keep my documentation
    — or team’s one — organized and up-to-date. *It’s like having an extra set of
    hands on the team!*

    ChatGPT, *this process just got a lot easier.*

    libraries.
