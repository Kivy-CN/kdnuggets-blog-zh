    we are treated to a super harsh guide to machine learning, find that Google is
    acquiring Kaggle, get pro-supervised learning advice from Salesforce's chief data
    scientist, hear a goodbye from Andrew Ng as he resigns from Baidu, and learn more
    exciting info about Distill, the web-based "Interactive, Visual Journal for Machine
    Learning Research."

    this month, Google and Kaggle teamed up to host a $100,000 machine learning competition
    around classifying YouTube videos. That competition had some deep integrations
    with the Google Cloud Platform, too.

    of possibilities for crossover here. The event is either exciting or terrifying,
    depending on your views on potential monopolies. But it's a great branding move,
    and can help Google extend their recent interests in becoming the lone global

  zh: 我们将拭目以待谷歌在 Kaggle 上的最终目标是什么，但这里有各种交叉的可能性。根据你对潜在垄断的看法，这个事件要么令人兴奋，要么令人恐惧。但这是一个很好的品牌推广举措，并且可以帮助谷歌扩展其最近成为全球唯一机器学习巨头的兴趣。

    meat lovers pizza, just go chop some wood"), I can see where he is coming from
    to some extent. It would be a great educational undertaking, and could support
    the community at large, especially so if he were to encourage the sharing of said
    curated dataset afterward. But really, in general, I wouldn't think that everyone
    working on unsupervised learning problems would or should go out and label classification
    data. That clearly wouldn't lead to progress in unsupervised learning.

    to transforming large companies to use AI, there are also rich opportunities for
    entrepreneurship as well as further AI research. I want all of us to have self-driving
    cars; conversational computers that we can talk to naturally; and healthcare robots
    that understand what ails us. The industrial revolution freed humanity from much
    repetitive physical drudgery; I now want AI to free humanity from repetitive mental
    drudgery, such as driving in traffic.

    visualizations into a single environment. In such an environment, users can explore
    in ways impossible with traditional static media. They can change models, try
    out different hypotheses, and immediately see what happens. That will let them
    rapidly build their understanding in ways impossible in traditional static media.
