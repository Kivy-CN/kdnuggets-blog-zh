- en: In this vast landscape of AI, a revolutionary force emerged in the form of Large
    Language Models (LLMS). It is not just a buzzword but our future. Their ability
    to understand and generate human-like text brought them into the spotlight and
    now it has become one of the hottest areas of research. Imagine a chatbot that
    can respond to you as if you are talking to your friends or envision a content
    generation system that it becomes difficult to distinguish whether it's written
    by a human or an AI. If things like this intrigue you and you want to dive further
    into the heart of LLMs, then you are at the right place. I have gathered a comprehensive
    list of resources ranging from informative articles, courses, and GitHub repositories
    to relevant research papers that can help you understand them better. Without
    any further delay, let's kickstart our amazing journey in the world of LLMs.
