  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Text Classification is the process of categorizing text into one or more different
    classes to organize, structure, and filter into any parameter. For example, text
    classification is used in legal documents, medical studies and files, or as simple
    as product reviews. Data is more important than ever; companies are spending fortunes
    trying to extract as many insights as possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With text/document data being much more abundant than other data types, new
    methods of utilizing them are imperative. Since data is inherently unstructured
    and extremely plentiful, organizing data to understand it in digestible ways can
    drastically improve its value. Using Text Classification with Machine Learning
    can automatically structure relevant text in a faster and more cost-effective
    way.

    but the most commonly used methods involve machine learning. There are six basic
    steps that a text classification model goes through before being deployed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    case of text classification, supervised machine learning algorithms are used,
    thus providing our machine learning model with labeled data. **Labeled data** is
    data predefined for our algorithm with an informative tag attached to it.

    and word embedding of the provided text will be necessary for the model to correctly
    recognize data.

    data on a token-based level and can not understand and process complete sentences.
    Further processing on the given raw dataset would be required for our model to
    easily digest the given data. Remove unnecessary features, filtering out null
    and infinite values, and more. Shuffling the entire dataset would help prevent
    any biases during the training phase.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Providing your algorithm with low-quality data will result in poor future predictions. However,
    a very common problem among machine learning practitioners is feeding the training
    model with a data set that is too detailed that include unnecessary features.
    Overcrowding the data with irrelevant data can result in a decrease in model performance.
    When it comes to choosing and organizing a data set, Less is More.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wrong training to testing data ratios will can greatly affect your model's performance
    and affect shuffling and filtering. With precise data points that are not skewed
    by other unneeded factors, the training model will perform more efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When training your model choose a data set that fits your model's requirements,
    filter the unnecessary values, shuffle the data set, and test your final model
    for accuracy. Simpler algorithms take less computing time and resources; the best
    models are the simplest ones that can solve complex problems.

- en: Overfitting and Underfitting
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Accuracy of models when training reaches a peak and then slowly tapers off as
    training continues. This is called overfitting; the model begins to learns unintended
    patterns since training has lasted too long . Be cautious when achieving high
    accuracy on the training set since the main goal is to develop models that have
    their accuracy rooted in the testing set (data the model has not seen before).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other end, underfitting is when the training model still has room for
    improvement and has not yet reached its maximum potential. Poorly trained models
    stem from the length of time trained or is over-regularized to the dataset. This
    exemplifies the point of having concise and precise data.

    80/20 is a good start, but tuning the parameters may be what your specific model
