    But while they are related, there are some glaring differences, especially between
    the responsibilities of developers working in either field.

    and it’s possible to find even more lucrative jobs for those who specialize in
    data analytics and machine learning algorithms. So, let’s take a look at the differences

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science as a field requires an in-depth analysis of significant volumes
    of data, usually with the aim of finding ways to use it to support business goals.
    For example, business data can be used to inform competitive research, enhance
    research capabilities, [improve web design](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/data-science-how-is-it-changing-the-process-of-web-design/),
    and more. Data scientists perform algorithmic coding, statistics, and data processing
    to formulate research questions, analyze the data, and present results as written
    and visual reports.

- en: Machine learning (ML) is a [subset of data science](/2021/11/common-misconception-about-machine-learning.html)
    specifically focused on training computers to make decisions based on past data.
    ML is what powers the class of technology we know as artificial intelligence (AI).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The algorithmic coding methods used in this field teach the computer to solve
    problems step-by-step, helping it learn more about processes and behaviors. In
    this way, the model teaches the computer to recognize patterns to predict future
    behavior. The result is a model that can fall under different categories, including
    unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

- en: A robust ML model will have the capability to run on various data sets and show
    reproducible results. This field has gained traction in the past few years, as
    AI is used to assist human decision-making in everything from [data privacy and

    such as coding practices, purpose, and expertise needed. Let’s take a closer look
    at these differences.

    their models. ML developers usually take the time to inherently learn and understand
    languages such as C++ and Python. Python is the most common choice for ML.

    to code [systematic thinking](/2021/11/5-things-set-data-scientist-apart-other-professions.html)
    for the purpose of data analysis.  High-level languages require more significant
    expertise but can get the task done more quickly, so most data scientists use
    high-level assembly language to perform their functions. We’ll see some examples
    below.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although widely similar, machine learning and data science have different purposes,
    resulting in unique coding techniques. For example, data scientists must prove
    hypotheses based on datasets and create a report or visual explaining their findings.
    The goal is to tell a story or form a theory based on data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, machine learning developers create algorithms and software
    that can help a computer learn independently. The coding is performed so that
    the computer can recognize patterns on its own and solve problems unsupervised.
    Machine learning results in models and algorithms that can be applied for [faster
    decision making](https://dataconomy.com/2021/05/machine-learning-vs-artificial-intelligence-future-data-science/)
    in a variety of fields.

    are given and create conclusions on said data. This can not be done without a
    strong understanding of coding languages, among other skills. On the other hand,
    machine learning engineers are required to apply logic and critical thinking to
    code models that train classification and recognition tasks.
