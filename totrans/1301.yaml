    hypothesis sets the direction and plan for a Data Science project. Accordingly,
    a hypothesis is the most important item for evaluating whether a Data Science
    project will be successful.

    in favor of hands-on testing for feature significance and applying models on data
    in order to see if they are able to predict anything. While there is certainly
    always a need for feature engineering and model selection, doing so without true
    understanding of a problem can be dangerous and inefficient.

    problems which guarantees both a relevant hypothesis and a strong signal as to
    whether a Data Science approach will be successful. In this article, I outline
    the steps used to do this: defining a data context, examining available data,
    and forming the hypothesis. I also take a look at a few completed competitions
    from Kaggle and run them through the process in order to provide real examples
    of this method in action.'

- en: Much like forming a Free Body Diagram in a physics problem or utilizing Object-Oriented
    Design in Computer Science, describing all valid entities in a given data context
    helps to map out the expected interplay between them. The goal of this step is
    to completely designate all the data that could possibly be collected about anything
    in the context i.e. a description of the perfect dataset. If all of this data
    were available, then the interactions between the components would be completely
    defined and heuristic formulas could be used to define every type of cause and
    effect.

  id: totrans-16

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, an observation is conducted to determine how much of the available data
    fits into the perfect dataset defined in the previous step. The more overlap found,
    the better a solution space for defining interactions between entities. While
    not a numeric metric, this observation gives a strong signal for intuition of
    whether the available data is appropriate and relevant enough. If there is a complete
    overlap, then a heuristic is probably a better solution than fitting a data model.
    If there is very little overlap, then even the best modeling techniques will be
    unable to consistently provide accurate predictions. Note that the strongest predictive
    signals will always be those that are directly related, thus indirect feature
    relation is given less emphasis in favor of the real thing. The intuition behind
    focusing mainly on strong signals is that collecting better data with strong signals
    will guarantee better performance and reliability. Conversely, predictions using
    weak signals are prime candidates to become obsolete once better data is available.

  zh: '*3. 形成假设*'
- en: Having completed the previous two steps, forming a hypothesis itself becomes
    trivial. Hypotheses are generally formed by combining a set of available features
    to predict the outcome of another feature that may be hard to collect in the future
    or whose value may be needed ahead of its outcome.
  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 完成前两个步骤后，形成假设本身变得简单。假设通常是通过组合一组可用特征来预测另一特征的结果，这些特征可能在未来难以收集或其值可能在结果出现之前就需要。
- en: 'Now that the overlap between the data context and available data has been clearly
    defined, and assuming a reasonable amount of the available data is relevant/class-balanced/etc,
    a hypothesis can simply be stated as: “The available data can produce significant
    results predicting *____ *in the given data context”. Note that the prediction
    label is left open-ended since it can potentially be filled in with many different
    things! This is because a hypothesis can be formed around almost any of the given
    features as long as it fits within the data context and there is enough overlap
    with the available data. Picking the specific feature to predict will depend upon
    what use cases are most beneficial.'

  zh: 既然数据背景与可用数据之间的重叠已经明确界定，并且假设相当一部分可用数据是相关的/类别平衡的/etc，那么假设可以简单地表述为：“可用数据可以在给定的数据背景中产生显著的结果，预测*____*”。请注意，预测标签是开放的，因为它可以被填入许多不同的内容！这是因为，只要符合数据背景且与可用数据有足够的重叠，几乎可以围绕任何给定的特征形成假设。选择特定的预测特征将取决于哪些使用案例最有利。

    nature that predictions are performed for a virtual world. Predictions of simulations
    are expected to behave much more consistently and operate along very clearly defined
    paths, as opposed to real-life systems which may have factors not easily observable.
    In other words, the data context can very confidently be exhaustively defined.

    set of actions. The data context has been mapped out below:'

    this technique for generating hypotheses ignores feature correlation or indirect
    relation in favor of focusing on the absolute strongest signals i.e. directly
    related features. In this competition, predictions involving the Player-Controlled
    Character and the Match are captured with a good amount of detail.Contrary to
    this, although we might be able to infer things about a Player based on their
    Player-Controlled Character this is avoided since it makes for a weaker hypothesis.

  zh: 利用这些洞察，可以定义出强有力的假设候选。再次强调，这种生成假设的技术忽略了特征相关性或间接关系，而是专注于绝对最强的信号，即直接相关的特征。在这次比赛中，涉及玩家控制的角色和比赛的预测被详细捕捉。相反，虽然我们可能能够根据玩家控制的角色推断出关于玩家的情况，但由于这会使假设变弱，因此避免了这种做法。
