    integrity of every individual. That’s just one of the many triggers that led to
    the formulation of the GDPR and several other global regulations. With the increasing
    importance placed on data privacy, data masking has become necessary for organizations
    of all sizes to maintain the security and confidentiality of personal information.

    (PII) and restrict access whenever possible. It anonymizes and safeguards personal
    and sensitive information. That’s why it applies to bank accounts, credit cards,
    phone numbers, and health and social security details. No Personally Identifiable
    Information (PII) is visible during a data breach. You can also set additional
    security access rules within your organization.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data masking, as we know, is a technique used to protect sensitive data by replacing
    it with fictitious but realistic data. It protects personal data in compliance
    with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by ensuring that data breaches
    do not reveal sensitive information about individuals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since [data masking is an integral](https://www.k2view.com/what-is-data-masking)
    component of the data protection strategy, it applies to various data types such
    as files, backups, and databases. It works closely with encryption, access controls,
    monitoring, and others to ensure end-to-end compliance with GDPR and other regulations.

    data, a lot of enterprises are not following the guidelines and stand at the risk
    of breach. The most popular case is related to a clothing retailer, H&M, that
    had to incur a [fine of 35 million Euros](https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2020/hamburg-commissioner-fines-hm-353-million-euro-data-protection-violations_en)
    for violating the GDPR norms. It was found that the management had access to sensitive
    data such as an individual’s religious beliefs, personal issues, etc. That’s what
    GDPR tries to avoid and that’s why data masking is essential.

    laws, with jurisdictions such as California, Brazil, and Southeast Asia introducing
    laws such as CCPA and CCPR, LGPD, and PDPA, respectively, to protect personal
    data.

    necessary to protect sensitive information while still allowing the data to be
    used for its intended purpose. This can help organizations balance the need to
    protect sensitive data with the need to make use of the data for business purposes.

    credit card number to protect sensitive information while allowing the data to
    be used for financial transactions. Similarly, in personal data, only masking
    specific fields like name and address while keeping the other fields like gender
    and date of birth can be sufficient for specific use cases.

    users and thus protect their privacy. This is useful in ensuring compliance with
    regulations such as the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/)
    by ensuring that data breaches do not reveal sensitive information about individuals.

    and social security number with a unique pseudonym while keeping other non-sensitive
    attributes such as gender and date of birth intact. The pseudonyms can be generated
    using cryptographic techniques, such as hashing or encryption, to ensure that
    the original personal data cannot be reconstructed.

    a lot of benefits. In 2022, many data fabrics and product platforms got popular
    for their innovative approach. For example, K2view performs data masking at the
    business entity level, ensuring consistency and completeness while preserving

    Micro-Database, protected by its 256-bit encryption key. Additionally, the personally

    following predefined business rules, providing an added layer of protection.

    alone is insufficient to achieve GDPR compliance and should be used in conjunction
