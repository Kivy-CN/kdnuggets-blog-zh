    Python ecosystem to improve workload efficiency. That’s why so many Python libraries
    have been developed to accommodate data science tasks.

    popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and others. In truth,
    many hidden gems work better in certain situations than the popular libraries.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science is all about data. If you have bad-quality data, your analysis
    and model will be bad. There is even a phrase, "Garbage In, Garbage Out." That
    is why we need to manage our data quality well. Cleanlab is a library that can
    help you improve data quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) automatically cleans our datasets
    and identifies issues with the target label. The library works well for finding
    problems within a dataset and handling errors to improve the model''s performance.
    If you have a quality data problem, do not hesitate to check out the Cleanlab
    library.'

- en: Geographical data can make for among the the most exciting data science projects,
    yet it is one of the most difficult to process. Consistently maintaining the data
    to achieve precise spatial data is challenging because the segmentation is usually
    irregular and changes over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Uber''s open-source H3 library](https://github.com/uber/h3) can help facilitate
    the use of geographical data. The H3 library uses the hexagonal grid system, dividing
    the data into hexagonal cells and structures to acquire consistent location data.
    The data could be used for any accurate location-based analysis and improve the
    geographical applications.'

- en: No, it’s not the dessert. The Python library [IceCream](https://github.com/gruns/icecream)
    is a sweet treat that can enrich your data science work by improving the debugging
    process. In general, much of the programming activity is happening in the background,
    and we do not see what happens, including the data structure and processing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IceCream turns the simple print function into a debugging machine that can produce
    better information. The library could do many things, such as produce output that
    prints both the function or variable names with their values while highlighting
    the output syntax. Printing the data structures is also pretty, taking the mess
    and confusion out of the equation. Additionally, it can inspect the overall execution
    of your program.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science projects are useful to businesses, but we must also remember that
    many datasets we use are related to humans in numerous ways. The model system
    we establish needs to be as unbiased as possible and eliminate any possibility
    that could discriminate against certain social groups. It might not be your first
    instinct to perform any bias assessment during model creation, but it should always
    be there. That’s where Fairlearn could help you.
  prefs: []

- en: '[Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn) is a Python library that
    helps mitigate unfair issues in our machine learning systems. The library consists
    of fairness metrics and algorithms. The fairness metrics evaluate which groups
    were negatively impacted by the model and how fair it is overall. At the same
    time, the algorithm provides mitigation techniques to minimize bias and unfairness.'

- en: Data science involves a lot of statistical analysis, especially comparing datasets
    and groups. People might think that data science is all about machine learning
    modeling, but simple statistics can solve many projects. One common analysis is
    hypothesis testing between groups, such as ANOVA.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Post-hoc analysis is done after the initial analysis of ANOVA or similar analysis
    if significance is found during the analysis. [Scikit-posthocs](https://github.com/maximtrp/scikit-posthocs)
    is a Python library that facilitates post hoc analysis in our workflows. It provides
    all the tools that you can use to perform parametric and non-parametric tests
    with an API similar to the Scikit-learn. Try using this library if you want to
    validate your test results.
