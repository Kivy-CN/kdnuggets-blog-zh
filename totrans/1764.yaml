- en: In many real-world classification tasks such as churn prediction and fraud detection,
    we often encounter the class imbalance problem, which means one class is significantly
    outnumbered by the other class. The class imbalance problem brings great challenges
    to standard classification learning algorithms. Most of them tend to misclassify
    the minority instances more often than the majority instances on imbalanced data
    sets. For example, when a model is trained on a data set with 1% of instances
    from the minority class, a 99% accuracy rate can be achieved simply by classifying
    all instances as belonging to the majority class. Indeed, the problem of learning
    on imbalanced data sets is considered to be one of the ten challenging problems
    in data mining research.

- en: In order to solve the problem of learning from imbalanced data sets, many solutions
    have been proposed in the past few years. Resampling approaches try to solve the
    problem by resampling the data and act as a preprocessing phase. Their usage is
    assumed to be independent of the classifier and can be applied to any learning
    algorithm. Hence, resampling solutions are very popular in practice. One important
    question when we use resampling is whether we actually need a perfectly balanced
    data set. Our research on churn prediction shows that a balanced sampling is unnecessary.

- en: 'We used 11 real-world data sets from the telecommunication industry in our
    experiments. Seven sampling methods were considered, which include random over-sampling,
    random under-sampling SMOTE sampling and so on. We consider three different settings
    for the class ratios: 1:3, 2:3 and 1:1 (minority vs majority). Four benchmark
    classifiers are used in the experiments: logistic regression, C4.5 decision tree,
    support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF), which are widely used in
    churn prediction. The following table shows part of the results by using a 5 ×
    2 cross-validation experimental setup, where each entry represents the mean performance
    of each sampling rate across different classifiers and sampling methods. Beside
    the AUC measure, we also consider the maximum profit measure, which measures the
    profit produced by a retention campaign (Verbraken et al., 2013).'

- en: As the table shows, the ratio of 1:3 is the best on two data sets and the ratio
    of 2:3 ranks the first on two data sets. The balanced class ratio never reaches
    the top position. The results definitely show there is no need to produce balanced
    data sets after sampling and the less balanced strategy (1:3) would be our recommendation
    due to its relatively good performance. The complete results and more discussions
    can be found in our recent paper “Benchmarking sampling techniques for imbalance
    learning in churn prediction” published in JORS.
