    engineering, and analytics is very on trend right now — and that’s a good thing.
    Whether you’re talking about [treating data transformation as code](https://blog.getdbt.com/analytics-engineers-operate-with-leverage/), [adopting
    DataOps](https://www.datakitchen.io/what-is-dataops/) and Agile Data Governance
    practices, [thinking about data-as-a-product](https://medium.com/@itunpredictable/data-as-a-product-vs-data-as-a-service-d9f7e622dc55),
    or contemplating a [data mesh](https://medium.com/agile-lab-engineering/data-mesh-explanation-a207fac61341) architecture
    (essentially applying microservice fundamentals to the data and analytics stack),
    the world is coming around to *finally* viewing data and analytics as a team sport.
    But if you want to win this game, you need to find ways for players to interact
    and collaborate together, capture knowledge and make it easier for more people
    to play.

    especially when it comes to facilitating better collaboration and teamwork around
    data science and analytics. Great artists steal and, as the guy who writes and
    talks a lot about [Agile Data Governance](https://data.world/resources/what-is-data-governance/),
    I do it too!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But not everyone is on board with the idea that we’d be saved if we all just
    did what the software engineers and product managers do. People point out very
    valid issues around data privacy, bias, validity and other problems that make
    the output of analytics and data science much more sensitive than a typical agile
    software project. It’s also clear that work involving data and analytics often
    culminates in critical decision making in organizations that involve a much broader
    set of stakeholders than a typical software project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the pro side of the argument, agile practices that are inclusive, iterative
    and truly involve stakeholders throughout the project have the potential to bring
    data producers (data engineers and stewards) and consumers (data scientists and
    analysts) together in really meaningful ways. This can contribute to strong data-driven
    cultures and vastly improved data literacy.

    that is used by enterprises like Prologis, the world’s biggest logistics real
    estate company. By developing its analytics and data governance practice with
    a use-case driven agile approach, Prologis has been able to deploy it in a way
    that has been truly transformative.

    data governance, which wasn’t working for us. We knew we had to completely shift
    our approach by focusing on where our users were experiencing the most pain and
    aggravation. We then allowed that real-world data to drive how our data governance
    program expanded. In short, focusing on deploying our data catalog in an iterative
    way by prioritizing data assets based on business use-case has been key to reigniting
    employee interest in our governance program.”

    but what if I told you that there are two simple ideas from agile that you can
    implement today that will vastly improve both the quality of your data and analytics
    work and start promoting shared understanding and data literacy? The two ideas
    are Peer Review and the Definition of Done.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In software development the idea of the Code (or Peer) Review has been around
    far longer than the famous Github “Pull Request’’ feature that allows engineers
    to comment on each other’s work before it gets published. I first read about the
    technique in Steve McConnell’s [Code Complete](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=code+complete&qid=1631031686&sr=8-1) —
    which was initially published in 1992! There’s simple power and beauty in having
    a teammate double check your work and make suggestions on things you might’ve
    missed. For particularly complicated pieces of code, the two engineers might walk
    through it line-by-line, with the author explaining how it works to the reviewer,
    in real time. This has the added benefit of securing an important knowledge transfer,
    ensuring more than one person on the team knows how that code works and avoiding
    the dreaded “Bus Factor 1”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adding this style of review as part of your process is extremely impactful.
    Another benefit of this (especially since we’re almost all living in a remote
    world right now) is that commentary captured in doing these reviews can massively
    improve any of your data and analytics documentation efforts with nearly no additional
    effort. It’s important to note though that review should focus on a peer data
    scientist or analyst going through how the analysis was done, either line by line
    in code or stepping through how visualizations were created. This is not stakeholder
    or end-user acceptance testing. (In software the analogy would be like having
    a user click through the prototype and calling it done).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This point can’t be under emphasized: a peer reviewer will find errors in your
    technique or have suggestions that the business stakeholder simply won’t have
    (especially if the analysis happens to confirm a belief or previously held bias).
    Adding this step in the process will positively influence cross-department collaboration,
    overall data literacy and have a tremendous impact on the over quality of analysis
    done or data models delivered. I recommend that you Google [“Good Code Read Practices](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+run+a+code+review)”
    for a huge array of articles on how to do this well and think about how to adapt
    this to the data and analytics best practices within your company.'

- en: Something that can really make a difference in peer review sessions is having
    a great “Definition of Done”. The concept of the [Definition of Done ](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done/)comes
    from Scrum methodology in the software development world where the idea is that
    you should have a simple, yet unambiguous checklist to go through when a User
    Story is completed to make sure that, as an engineer (and as the reviewer), you’ve
    hit the mark. Having a simple checklist that all data scientists, analysts and
    engineers in your organization agree to use in order to sign off on work, can
    raise the bar for the quality and consistency of your data work significantly.

    and analytics at data.world, having these definitions of done (particularly the
    data modeling focused one), was instrumental in establishing our baseline for
    completing analytics engineering work. It ensured that even as we learned a new
    tool, we were consistent in what we were looking for as we reviewed each other’s
    work. This easily doubled our efficiency in getting new data models into our data
    warehouse as we migrated to Snowflake.

    you’re using to manage your projects today — you don’t even need any fancy new
    data or analytics infrastructure to do this. Often, just adapting software process
    tools like JIRA to your data and analytics practice is more than sufficient. If
    you’re organizing your analytics work around user stories, adding a “Peer Review”
    step into a tool like JIRA is incredibly easy. Using JIRA’s agile boards is simple
    and already incorporates a Review step:'

    assets is also extremely helpful and can be synced to your project management
    tools. These flags can be used to assign reviewers or to let consumers know if
    the asset is ready to use yet.

    software development principles and applying them to data and analytics work.
    And you know what? I will continue to steal from agile because I believe in creating
    collaborative, data-driven cultures where transparency and trust in data and analytics
    reign. Peer review and following a well-understood Definition of Done for data
    and analytics work are extremely valuable and simple ideas you can adopt today.
    No two changes are easier to implement or will have a greater positive impact
    on data quality and shared understanding within your organization.
