    philosophy. *The Black Swan *discusses the concept of highly improbable events,
    while the fourth book in the *Incerto*,* Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder* discusses
    ways in which you can make yourself not just robust to disruption, but set yourself
    up to be better off because of it. I think *The Black Swan *is the most relevant
    of the bunch for data science).'

    to end the day than with a book (print, ebook, or audiobook it doesn’t matter).
    Data science requires constantly expanding the tools in your toolkit, and, even
    when we want something to relax and take our minds off work, that doesn’t mean
    we can’t be learning.

- en: These books are all engrossing reads that also teach us lessons about [data
    science](http://towardsdatascience.com/) and life. The 6 works described here
    will provide a helpful supplement to more technical works by demonstrating what
    actually drives humans. Understanding how people think in reality — as opposed
    to idealized models — is just as critical as statistics for enabling better data-driven
    decisions.
