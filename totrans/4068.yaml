    better known as ISLR, has been cherished—by both machine learning beginners and
    practitioners alike—as one of the best machine learning textbooks.

    you liked best about it. But here’s my story.

- en: The summer before I started grad school, I decided to teach myself machine learning.
    I was lucky to stumble across ISLR early in my machine learning journey. The authors
    of ISLR do a great job at breaking down complex machine learning algorithms in
    an easy-to-follow manner—along with the required mathematical foundations—without
    overwhelming the learners. This is an aspect of the book I enjoyed.
  prefs: []

    did not know R back then, but was comfortable programming in Python. So I had
    two options.'

    build models in Python. Like most other Pythonistas, I chose the second option
    (yeah, the more familiar route, I know).

    code along and build machine learning models in Python.** No more worries about

    However, it's an appropriate adaptation for Python which is expected. This book
    also includes a Python programming crash course section to learn the basics.
