- en: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning model where the agent learns
    from trial and error to reach the goal. It is a goal-oriented algorithm where
    an agent receives a reward when it performs the correct action. These rewards
    are helping agents to navigate through a complex environment to reach the final
    goal. Just like a toddler learning to walk on its own by trial and error. Similarly,
    a machine learns to perform complex tasks without human intervention.

    the environment and achieves better performance than humans. Whereas supervised
    and unsupervised learning models depend on existing data that is collected from
    humans and are limited to human intelligence. For example, Deepmind’s [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/)
    learned various strategies on its own to defeat the world champion of the Go board
    game.

- en: Let’s take an example of a Mario game. At the start of the game agent (Mario)
    is at state zero, based on its state the agent will take an action. In this case,
    Mario will move forward. Now the agent is in a new state (new frame). The agent
    will receive a reward as it has survived moving forward. The agent will keep making
    moves until it has finished the stage or dead in the process. The main goal of
    RL is to maximize reward collection by taking minimum steps.

    start by learning the basics. Take a Youtube tutorial or complete a course. After
    that, start working on a project or participate in a competition. I learned everything
    about RL by participating in Kaggle competitions, and in the process if I get
    stuck, I read blogs or various tutorials to expand my knowledge.
