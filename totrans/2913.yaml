- en: The biggest challenge of the next decade of artificial intelligence(AI) is going
    to be based on determining whether data and intelligence remains a privilege of
    a handful of large technology companies based in a few countries or it can be
    democratized to the rest of the world. The centralized nature of machine learning
    and AI applications foments a “rich get richer” dynamic in which only the companies
    with access to high quality datasets and data science talent are able to take
    advantage of AI opportunities. The field of decentralized AI is one of the leading
    trends that is looking to address this challenge. Although still impractical for
    many real world implementations, the decentralized AI space have been steadily
    gaining traction within the AI community. Recently, AI researchers from Microsoft
    open sourced the [Decentralized & Collaborative AI on Blockchain](https://github.com/microsoft/0xDeCA10B) project
    that enables the implementation of decentralized machine learning models based
    on blockchain technologies.

    learning models can be improved with certain degrees of decentralization. Let’s
    take the example of a simple prediction model that is designed to forecast sales
    of a given product. In the traditional centralized approach, we need to implicitly
    trust a group of data scientists to select the right neural network architecture,
    build the correct datasets, train the model efficiently, tune the hyperparameters
    in order to optimize performance and a dozen of other tasks. After all that, we
    can’t really be sure the model is performing optimally. This problem gets even
    worse once we start introducing new versions of the model as its nearly impossible
    to correlate specific changes with a particular performance. Decentralized AI
    methods look to simplify this problem by enabling transparent accountability and
    organic collaboration across all stages of the machine learning lifecycle.

    important catalyzer for decentralized AI architectures. The immutability and distributed
    consensus models of blockchain technologies intrinsically introduce a level of
    trust and enables collaborative dynamics in machine learning applications. The
    Microsoft Research team leveraged some of the native capabilities of blockchain
    technologies to enable different levels of decentralization in machine learning
    models.

    and train machine learning models on a blockchain infrastructure. The current
    version of DCAI is contrained to the Ethereum blockchain and leverages smart contracts
    as the main encapsulation mechanism for machine learning programs. Conceptually,
    smart contracts are immutable programs that contain business logic that executes
    on a blockchain runtime. In the case of the DCAI framework, smart contracts are
    used to enable decentralized training mechanisms in machine learning models.
