- en: Big data. Deep learning. Predictive analytics. A lot of jargon is thrown around
    within data science departments and in the leading business news sites these days,
    and there’s a big hiring scramble across industries to develop advanced analytics
    to aid in decision-making. But what is important to know as an executive?

    much of the work and new developments related to these fields fall into a few
    general principles and concepts. This guide aims to provide a short overview of
    key data-related topics and terms commonly used in data science today along with
    examples of how they are used in data science.

    in storage and analysis, marked by high volumes (lots of records), high degree
    of variety (text data, video data, and numerical data together), velocity (streaming
    data), and veracity (quality of data). Many times, this refers to the number of
    records, which can be in the billions or trillions, such as transaction data with
    retail or lead data within large marketing campaigns. Storage becomes an issue
    with this type of data. However, big data can also refer to data that has a lot
    of information about a given record, such as genomics data on a patient or academic
    records of a given student, and this type of data can be very tricky to analyze
    through statistics, as it violates many assumptions of analysis tools. Data may
    be large but contain quality control issues, such as missing data, corrupted records,
    or incorrect capture strategy; this is one of the most common reasons analytics
    projects fail and a key reason why data capture strategy is so important. **Data
    engineers** work with capturing and optimally storing data for future use in analyses
    or reporting.'

- en: '**Hadoop** and **SQL** are two common databases for data storage (where the
    data “lives” while it awaits analysis). SQL is common in established businesses
    and businesses that don’t have high volumes of data; Hadoop is preferred when
    dealing with very large datasets. Other databases exist, but they are generally
    unique to a certain industry. **MapReduce** is a related framework that helps
    manage and analyze large volumes of data by chopping up the data and storing or
    analyzing those parts. In this way, a set of computers can work on an analysis
    or store similar data without needing a large storage space on any given computer.
    Data and results stored across computers can then be pooled together as needed
    for a final result. It is common within Hadoop and specialized big data databases/analysis
    tools.'

- en: '**Artificial intelligence** (AI) is a broad field of computer science that
    includes design of software systems and algorithms to help computers understand
    speech, represent knowledge, train robots to navigate, reason through problems,
    and understand images or videos. Generally, there is a goal and data upon which
    to train the software or optimize the software towards that goal. **Algorithms**
    are a set of instruction to a computer guiding this learning process or decision-making,
    usually based on data and optimizing the instructions based on that data.'

- en: '**Statistical modeling** and **machine learning** are related to AI and algorithms
    through their overlap with mathematics and statistics. Models statistically test
    relationships between an outcome of interest (such as customer churn, leads acquired
    in a marketing campaign, or weekly sales) and a set of predictors (such as customer
    demographics, buying patterns, click behavior, or other characteristics known
    about leads or customers that might be related to a given outcome). Many times,
    these models can also be used to predict future behavior given the important predictors
    found by the model. Machine learning extends many common statistical models to
    accommodate big data, and it also includes tools to explore the data outside of
    prediction, which can be used to segment customer bases or group sales trends
    over time. Common software languages for implementing such models are **R** and
    **Python**, and the professionals who use these advanced tools to investigate
    business problems are generally titled **data scientists**, with **data science**
    referring to the work they do to understand business problems, create predictive
    models, or test new operating procedures/marketing campaigns.'

- en: '**Supervised learning algorithms** include machine learning models that learn
    relationships between outcomes and predictors, with the goal of either understanding
    drivers of a given outcome or simply predicting future outcomes given a set of
    predictors. One of the downsides of supervised learning is that outcomes must
    be observed and that a sufficient amount of data exists upon which to train the
    model. **Classification** models are supervised learning algorithms used to understand
    how groups differ from each other; an example is creating a model to understand
    how buyer ad click behavior and non-buyer ad click behavior differ. **Regression**
    models (within supervised learning) deal with continuous or count outcomes, such
    as modeling drivers of purchase quantity or service utilization within a given
    month. **Unsupervised learning algorithms** explore the data to understand how
    predictors or outcomes can be grouped, similar to marketing segmentation or visual
    exploration of data trends.'

- en: '**Deep learning** is a type of artificial neural network similar to simple
    circuits within a brain, a type of supervised learning algorithm commonly used
    in predictive modeling which works very well on data with lots of records. Unlike
    other models that plateau in performance within a few thousand training records,
    deep learning models continue to improve as they are given more and more training
    data. However, it takes a lot of data to reach good performance with deep learning,
    and training samples of 5,000 or 10,000 records may not be sufficient for training
    this type of supervised learning algorithm. Oftentimes, deep learning requires
    substantial expertise to customize or build from scratch, and it’s helpful to
    hire an expert in deep learning if the problem or data is complicated or small
    in size.'

- en: '**Random forest** is another supervised learning algorithm that is quite common
    in practice today. This algorithm performs well for both classification and regression
    models, and it is well-suited to big data through the map reduce framework. At
    its core, this method includes a set of models built on samples of data, which
    are aggregated together into a final model. This helps reduce errors and incorrectly-learned
    relationships within the set of individual models.'

- en: '**Topological data analysis** is a relatively new set of tools, mainly used
    for unsupervised learning, that have good properties with respect to small data
    samples, large numbers of predictors, missing data, and errors in data capture.
    The tools also come with helpful visualization methods that can simplify results
    and allow data teams to explore the findings further (shown below to highlight
    records that don’t fit in with other records). This makes them an ideal choice
    for unsupervised learning, and they are common in industry like biotech, healthcare,
    and education.'

- en: No matter what the technique used, there are a few caveats to any analysis related
    to the data used to train the models. **Sampling** and **bias** are two important
    consideration when selecting data for use in statistical modeling or machine learning.
    If only data from customers in New England are selected for an analysis, the results
    of a model may not generalize to customers in Georgia or Texas; this is an example
    of bias in the analysis. Sampling methods are important to reduce possible bias,
    as well as address several statistical issues that can lead to bad results. **Overpowering**
    an analysis, in which too much data is used to test group differences or look
    for relationships in the data, can suggest relationships that don’t actually exist,
    as the model is finding tiny fluctuations within a given predictor rather than
    a true relationship. This is very important in A/B testing of marketing campaigns.
