- en: With the emergence of large language models, prompt engineering has become an
    essential skill. Put simply, prompting involves how humans interact with machines.
    Engineering the prompt suggests an effective way to communicate the requirement
    so that the machines’ responses are contextual, relevant, and accurate.

    your interactions with AI systems. Let’s learn to create powerful prompts by following
    the six-step framework, including persona, context, and task, and show me how
    expected output and tone.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider a persona as the go-to person or a domain expert you’d approach to
    solve a particular task. Persona is similar, just that the expert is now the model
    you are interacting with. Assigning the persona to the model is equivalent to
    giving it a role or identity that helps set the appropriate level of expertise
    and perspective for the task at hand.

- en: 'Example: “As an expert in sentiment analysis through customer care conversations…”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model that is trained on a huge corpus of data is now instructed to tap
    into the knowledge and perspective of a data scientist performing sentiment analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Context
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Context provides the background information and the scope of the task that the
    model must be aware of. Such an understanding of the situation could include facts,
    filters, or constraints that define the environment in which the model needs to
    respond.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Example: “… analyzing call records to understand the customer pain points and
    their sentiments from the call details between a customer and agent”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This context highlights the specific case of call center data analysis. Providing
    context is equivalent to an optimization problem – giving too much context can
    obscure the actual objective while providing too little limits the model’s ability
    to respond appropriately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Task
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The task is the specific action that the model must take. This is the whole
    objective of your prompt that the model must accomplish. I call it 2C – clear
    and concise, implying the model should be able to understand the expectation.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that there is no free lunch. The large language models have been shown
    to hallucinate, meaning they tend to produce misleading or incorrect results.
    As [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-hallucinations)
    explains, “These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, including insufficient
    training data, incorrect assumptions made by the model, or biases in the data
    used to train the model.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to limit such behavior is to ask the model to explain how it arrived
    at the response, rather than just share the final answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    behind the computed sentiment.”'

- en: 5\. Expected Output
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mostly, we need the output in a specified format that is structured in a clear
    and easy-to-follow. Depending on how the user consumes the information, the output
    could be organized in the form of a list, a table, or a paragraph.

- en: 6\. Tone
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although specifying the tone is often considered optional, specifying it helps
    tailor the language to the intended audience. There are various tones that the
    model can alter its response, such as casual, direct, cheerful, etc.

    jargon where possible.”'

    are analyzing call records to understand the customer pain points and their sentiments
    from the call details between a customer and agent. Analyze the data and learn
    to compute the sentiment from any future conversation. Provide a brief explanation
    highlighting the words and the reasoning behind the computed sentiment. Share
    the response for the give call summary in a 2-pointer format including Customer
    sentiment and Keywords that reflect the sentiment category. Use a professional
    yet accessible tone, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only does this framework lay down the groundwork for a clear ask, but it
    also adds the necessary context and describes the persona to tailor the response
    to the specific situation. Asking the model to show how it arrives at the results
    adds further depth.

    Practicing and refining the prompting skills allows us to extract more value from
    AI interactions.

    hope this framework provides you with a solid structure, however, do not feel
    restricted by it. Use it as a baseline to experiment further and keep adjusting
    based on your specific needs.
