    if he had a better answer.

    understand what data scientists do, and a cheat sheet to break down any data science
    problem.

    5-day email course](http://springboard.com/resources/data-science-email). Here’s
    a summary of his insights.

- en: '**Step 1: Frame the problem**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing you have to do before you solve a problem is to define exactly
    what it is. You need to be able to translate data questions into something actionable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll often get ambiguous inputs from the people who have problems. You’ll
    have to develop the intuition to turn scarce inputs into actionable outputs–and
    to ask the questions that nobody else is asking.
  prefs: []

- en: Say you’re solving a problem for the VP Sales of your company. You should start
    by understanding their goals and the underlying *why* behind their data questions.
    Before you can start thinking of solutions, you’ll want to work with them to clearly
    define the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A great way to do this is to ask the right questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should then figure out what the sales process looks like, and who the customers
    are. You need as much context as possible for your numbers to become insights.

- en: In response to your questions, the VP Sales might reveal that they want to understand
    why certain segments of customers have bought less than expected. Their end goal
    might be to determine whether to continue to invest in these segments, or de-prioritize
    them. You’ll want to tailor your analysis to that problem, and unearth insights
    that can support either conclusion.

    and context you need to solve this problem.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve defined the problem, you’ll need data to give you the insights needed
    to turn the problem around with a solution. This part of the process involves
    thinking through what data you’ll need and finding ways to get that data, whether
    it’s querying internal databases, or purchasing external datasets.

    or a customer relationship management software platform.You can export the CRM
    data in a CSV file for further analysis.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Now that you have all of the raw data, you’ll need to process it before you
    can do any analysis. Oftentimes, data can be quite messy, especially if it hasn’t
    been well-maintained. You’ll see errors that will corrupt your analysis: values
    set to null though they really are zero, duplicate values, and missing values.
    It’s up to you to go through and check your data to make sure you’ll get accurate
    insights.'

    timezones of your users

    registered from before sales started
  prefs:

    some test values to see if your values make sense. If you detect something that
    doesn’t make sense, you’ll need to remove that data or replace it with a default
    value. You’ll need to use your intuition here: if a customer doesn’t have an initial
    contact date, does it make sense to say that there was NO initial contact date?
    Or do you have to hunt down the VP Sales and ask if anybody has data on the customer’s
    missing initial contact dates?'

    ideas that are likely to turn into insights. You’ll have a fixed deadline for
    your data science project (your VP Sales is probably waiting on your analysis
    eagerly!), so you’ll have to prioritize your questions. ‘
  prefs: []

    why sales are reduced for this group. You might notice that they don’t tend to
    be very active on social media, with few of them having Twitter or Facebook accounts.
    You might also notice that most of them are older than your general audience.
    From that you can begin to trace patterns you can analyze more deeply.

    mathematical and technological knowledge and leverage all of the data science
    tools at your disposal to crunch the data and find every insight you can.

    underperforming group with your average customer. You might find out that the
    age and social media activity are significant factors in predicting who will buy
    the product.

- en: 'If you’d asked a lot of the right questions while framing your problem, you
    might realize that the company has been concentrating heavily on social media
    marketing efforts, with messaging that is aimed at younger audiences. You would
    know that certain demographics prefer being reached by telephone rather than by
    social media. You begin to see how the way the product has been has been marketed
    is significantly affecting sales: maybe this problem group isn’t a lost cause!
    A change in tactics from social media marketing to more in-person interactions
    could change everything for the better. This is something you’ll have to flag
    to your VP Sales.'

    You start by explaining the reasons behind the underperformance of the older demographic.
    You tie that in with the answers your VP Sales gave you and the insights you’ve
    uncovered from the data. Then you move to concrete solutions that address the
    problem: we could shift some resources from social media to personal calls. You
    tie it all together into a narrative that solves the pain of your VP Sales: she
