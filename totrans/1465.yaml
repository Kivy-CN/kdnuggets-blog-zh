- en: The term “elevator pitch” originally came from the idea of entrepreneurs and
    small business owners developing a 30-second pitch when they were asked the question,
    “What do you do?” This might be at social occasions and events, etc. It was an
    opportunity for the business owner/entrepreneur to provide a very short (ergo,
    30-second) explanation of the value that they provide to their customers or clients,
    followed by presenting a business card. This activity has always been seen as
    a tool to “spread the word,” certainly not to seek funding.

- en: Over time, the elevator pitch definition has expanded significantly and now
    refers to not just the short little answer to that simple question. It has expanded
    into pitches that founders of startups use as they seek funding. Obviously, this
    type of pitch is longer and more detailed, and it occurs when such founders seek
    seed money to begin or to seek additional funding, once they have launched and
    need investment dollars to expand.

    enough that investors are looking put dollars into startups that can provide these
    services to small and mid-sized businesses that cannot afford to employ their
    own data scientist. You don’t’ yet have a huge competition in this market, and
    that puts you in a favorable position if you can get your pitch right.

- en: It takes far less money than before to launch a startup. And so, many founders
    use seed money (their own, family, friends, short-term small loans, crowdfunding,
    etc.) to develop at least an MVP (minimum viable product) and then show that it
    is a viable product through the acquisition of a few customers/clients.

  zh: 启动一家初创公司所需的资金比以前少得多。因此，许多创始人使用种子资金（他们自己、家庭、朋友、短期小额贷款、众筹等）来开发至少一个MVP（最小可行产品），然后通过获取少量客户/客户来展示它是一个可行的产品。

  zh: 这很重要。投资者希望看到产品/服务是可行的证据。你可以这样做：
- en: “Show, don’t tell.” Don’t just say what your data science startup will provide.
    Show what it has provided for the few clients you have, or provide a visual demonstration
    of how a specific aspect of your data science service provides its Barring that,
    show some stats from your initial customers. For example, “Of the 15 clients we
    initially brought on board, all 15 continue to use our services, after a full
    year of collaboration.”

  zh: “展示，不要仅仅说明。” 不要只是说你的数据科学初创公司将提供什么。展示它为你现有的少数客户提供了什么，或者提供一个视觉演示，展示你的数据科学服务的某个特定方面如何解决问题。否则，展示一些来自初期客户的统计数据。例如，“在我们最初引入的15位客户中，所有15位在合作满一年后仍继续使用我们的服务。”
- en: Access to Investors has Changed Dramatically. Seeking investors used to be a
    rather secretive process. You need to know someone who knew someone who might
    be interested. The Internet has changed all of that. With crowd-funding venues,
    lists of “angel investors,” open events that solicit pitches, etc., you can easily
    find potential funders and design your pitches to reach targeted investors individually.
    Further, networking can occur online and is no longer geo-specific.

- en: New Formats for Pitching. Pitching events, where founders went on stage and
    provided their pitch to an audience of investors, is still one avenue that is
    common. But lots of founders are getting far more proactive. They are creating
    video pitches that can be embedded in their websites and, as well, sent out and
    posted all over the place, without the need for physical presence. And consider
    the possibilities of reaching out to foreign investors – a whole new world of
    funding, particularly in the tech sector, such as data science.

    will not be sufficient. If you intend to create a video presentation (and you
    must), then understand that it has to be both professional and personal, depending
    upon your audiences. You have to research those audiences and perhaps develop
    unique scripts for each of them. And then, of course, the script must be written
    and practiced before delivery. Again, professional help may be warranted. Joe
    Lesinski, a scriptwriter for clients of [WowGrade](https://wowgrade.net/do-my-essay),
    puts it this way: “Writing a script is a specific skill that most do not have.
    Anyone who is not schooled in this skill will falter. Best to find a decent scriptwriter
    with experience in marketing video scripts, if you intend to capture an audience.”'

  zh: 电梯推介需要一个脚本——你对公司热情的展示是不够的。如果你打算制作一个视频演示（并且你必须这样做），那么要明白它必须既专业又个人化，这取决于你的受众。你需要研究这些受众，也许为每个受众开发独特的脚本。然后，脚本必须在演讲前写好并练习。再次，专业帮助可能是必要的。Joe
    Lesinski，[WowGrade](https://wowgrade.net/do-my-essay)的客户编剧，这样说道：“编写脚本是一项特定技能，大多数人没有。任何没有这种技能的人都会失败。如果你打算吸引观众，最好找一个有经验的市场营销视频脚本编剧。”
