    open community for creating and using synthetic data in computer vision and machine
    learning (ML).

    In the visual domain, synthetic data has shown promise in creating more capable
    and ethical AI models. By creating a centralized hub for datasets, papers, code,
    and resources, we aim to bring together researchers from industry and academia
    to advance state-of-the-art synthetic data.

- en: The next generation of computer vision will be powered by synthetic data. Over
    the last few years, synthetic data has emerged as a disruptive new paradigm to
    train AI models. Through visual effects (VFX), neural rendering, and generative
    AI technologies, researchers have demonstrated the ability to build vast amounts
    of photorealistic, diverse, and perfectly labeled data sets faster and at decreased
    costs. This will enable more capable models for autonomous vehicles, robotics,
    drones, AR/VR/metaverse, generated media, and many more applications spanning
    from consumer to medical use-cases.

- en: Current computer vision models require vast amounts of human-annotated data
    to help cameras identify what they’re seeing. This is time and labor-intensive,
    making it prohibitively expensive, and it also has significant shortcomings. It’s
    difficult for humans to interpret key data attributes, such as the 3D position
    of an object or its interactions with its environment.

- en: Additionally, the inability to capture sufficiently diverse and balanced datasets
    often leads to bias, which has significant ethical implications in human-centered
    systems. Furthermore, increasing regulatory scrutiny and consumer privacy concerns
    make collecting and leveraging images of people complicated.

- en: With synthetic data approaches, information about every pixel in the scene is
    explicitly defined. Pixel-accurate labels that were not previously available for
    3D landmarks, depth, material properties, surface normals, sub-segmentation, and
    more are now available. Furthermore, the data and labels can be provided on demand,
    allowing ML practitioners to experiment and iterate orders of magnitude faster
    than was previously possible in a true data-centric paradigm. Synthetic data also
    addresses critical ethical issues by reducing bias, preserving privacy, and democratizing
    access to data.

- en: Synthetic data represents a paradigm shift for training computer vision models,
    but it is also the gateway technology to build more generalized intelligence.
    Moving forward, researchers will increasingly leverage these digital worlds to
    build AI models that deeply understand and are capable of interacting and manipulating
    the world around them.

- en: OpenSynthetics will bring together researchers and practitioners across academia
    and industry in an open and collaborative community to help propel the space forward.
    We believe synthetic data will come to power the next generation of computer vision
    and that together we can help catalyze innovation. By contributing and participating
    in the site, the community will actively build the knowledge base to help grow
    the understanding and drive adoption of this emerging technology. We hope you
    will join us to create a thriving [OpenSynthetics](https://opensynthetics.com/)
    community.
