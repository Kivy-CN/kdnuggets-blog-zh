    every day by guiding the maintenance of bridges, buildings, and vehicles, and
    by guiding healthcare providers and law enforcement officers.

    learning to combat risk, actively protecting you from all sorts of dangers and
    hazards, including fires, explosions, collapses, crashes, workplace accidents,
    restaurant E. coli, and crime. And I thought lions and tigers and bears were bad!

    and deploy inspections and preventative measures accordingly. That is, flag the
    riskiest buildings, bridges, vehicles, and restaurants for a check-up. This kind
    of predictive prevention is more and more becoming a safety standard.

    experience encoded in data. Given data on, say, the history of many bridges and
    which ones deteriorated to become risky, the computer learns to predict which
    bridges should be flagged for inspection ASAP. When deployed for safety purposes
    and for other business and government purposes, machine learning is also known
    as predictive analytics.

    security in this life -- but machine learning contributes a singular improvement.
    It stands as a unique, novel approach to lowering risk, tipping the odds in favor
    of more safety. Since predictive prevention is different from other risk management
    approaches, it always potentially helps, regardless of what other approaches are
    also being adopted. Machine learning as it’s used in general improves the efficiency
    of all kinds of processes -- and when applied to procedures that protect, this
    translates to lower risk.

    predictive power, which delivers this and other tremendous benefits. Here are
    some example insights that help predict peril, which were told to us by data.
    Hurricanes with female names like Katrina and Maria are more deadly. A study of
    the most damaging hurricanes in the U.S. in recent decades showed that those with
    more feminine names killed almost three times as many people as those with more
    masculine names. Psychological research suggests this may result from implicit
    sexism -- people perceive "female" hurricanes as less risky, underestimating the
    danger and taking fewer precautions.

    blow up by a factor of about seven just before a hurricane. This is thought to
    be people stocking up on nonperishable comfort foods.

    to insurance companies. Experts theorize this is 'cause your financial responsibility
    could reflect your responsibility behind the wheel, although that's not conclusive.
    In any case, it's another example of data predicting mishaps.

    every day. By the way, you can actually find the details about most of these examples

    are saved by prioritizing inspections according to the risk level calculated for
    each structure. The New York City Fire Department uses predictive analytics to
    flag buildings with the highest risk of fire, Con Edison identifies manholes with
    five times the average risk of dangerous incidents like explosions or fires, and
    researchers in civil engineering predict which bridges are deteriorating, in part
    by using machine learning to automatically detect cracks in the concrete from
    automatically scanned images of bridges.

    of lead poisoning incidents than average. This serves to proactively flag, rather
    than the more common reactive steps taken after poisoning has been detected.

    companies and the military use machine learning to make driving safer -- to detect
    when a vehicle's driver is not alert due to distraction, fatigue, or intoxication,
    and to predict when vehicle parts will fail in order to proactively plan maintenance.

    the promise of improved safety records, in comparison to the recent, century-long

    on machine learning, which identifies objects in the vicinity, predicts their
    movements, and optimizes navigation.

    oil refineries, globally, the company Shell predicts the number of safety incidents
    that will transpire and assesses which factors make the biggest difference, such
    as a how measurably engaged employees are -- which the company believes has a
    big impact on decreasing accidents. Another factor, which applies to working environments
    in general: Accident Fund Insurance found that certain medical conditions such
    as obesity and diabetes are predictive of which occupational injuries will be
    highest in cost, in order to target workers accordingly for preventative measures.
    And researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health apply
    machine learning to determine which preventative practices -- be they ergonomic
    or concerning trips and falls -- are most important for each industry.'

    developing application area for machine learning, which is used to diagnose conditions
    and also predict clinical outcomes. For diagnosis, a machine learning model inputs
    all kinds of clinical features, test results, and even entire MRIs or other medical
    images to assess the probability of various diseases -- one model per disease
    -- such as diabetic retinopathy, which is the fastest growing cause of blindness,
    as well as various kinds of cancer. Often, it does so as well as -- or even better
    than -- doctors. As for predicting outcomes, machine learning foretells surgical
    infections, sepsis, HIV progression, premature births, hospital readmissions,
    and even death. In fact, there’s an entire episode of The Dr. Data Show on predicting
    death, which you can find at TheDoctorDataShow.com. By flagging high-risk cases,
    additional precautions can be targeted accordingly.

    as Boston and Seattle preemptively safeguard you from food poisoning by predicting
    which restaurants will have health code violations in order to prioritize inspections.
    In some cases, they're able to improve these predictions by inputting Yelp! reviews
    -- things people write about a restaurant can sometimes reveal that it's not up
    to snuff in the kitchen.

    cornerstone of society, enforcing it as effectively as possible is foundational.
    Predictive policing deploys machine learning to guide law enforcement decisions
    such as whether to investigate or detain, how long to sentence, and whether to
    parole. In making such decisions, judges and officers take into consideration
    the probability -- output by a predictive model -- that a suspect or defendant
    will be convicted for a crime in the future. These models base their calculations
    on factors such as the defendant's prior convictions, income level, employment
    status, family background, neighborhood, education level, and the behavior of
    family and friends.
