    surprising to see that Predictive Analytics was limited to multivariate regression
    and logistic models. This was in contrast to previous stints at Start-Ups funded
    by NASA / NIST where a broader set of Machine Learning (ML) methods including
    SVMs, NNs, Random or Gradient Boosting Trees were regularly applied.

- en: There were a number of good reasons for using the simpler models in Retail Lending.
    Firstly, Decision Frameworks were already in place that made input feature selection
    a relatively simpler exercise. For e.g., for Credit Decisioning, one could think
    in terms of 5Cs of Credit (Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, Conditions),
    and search for Data variables that catered to them. It wasn’t as hard as using
    Deep Learning to creating features from raw Images. Secondly, the relationship
    of the target variable with the inputs were not complex for e.g. Credit risk has
    a smooth inverse relationship with Income. One did not really need a Radial basis
    function to transform Income into a higher dimensional space, like one needed
    for SVM based Image classification. Thirdly, unlike today, Training and Deployment
    Platforms were not amenable to complex methods. Finally, a commonly stated reason
    was Model explainability (though experienced users of advanced ML models will
    find this debatable).

    packages became common and Data coming in different forms. However, the primary
    value for a Business came from identifying new powerful Data that could significantly
    improve Customer level Decisions. While Alternate Data Sources will always be
    a focus area, there are certain specific business problems which can be handled
    much better with new ML Algorithms that have become prevalent only in the last
    few years. Here, we discuss three such algorithms focusing on their application
    in Retail Lending.

    type of data. While Statisticians have traditionally created features (for e.g.
    different time window Averages) that try to capture some of the trend information,
    [LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
    are a class of recurrent neural networks that are specifically built to learn
    from sequence data.

    power to train new age ML algorithms and streamline their deployment. Variable
    Importance measures like Partial Dependence and Distance to Decision Boundary,
    can help in Model Explainability. It is still important to use appropriate technique
    for a given analytical problem and avoid complexity. Model Robustness, Incremental
    Business value, Customer experience, Implementation and Governance should be considered
    paramount. Machine Learning and the deluge of Alternate Data Sources has certainly
    paved way for more exciting “Modeling” times in Retail Lending.
