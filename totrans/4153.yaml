    such as C# and Java do not support multiple inheritance. For a good reason too.
    It prevents ambiguation and facilitates strong typing and encapsulation. This
    ultimately results in cleaner code and less confusing class/object model structures.
    However, multiple inheritance allows for more flexible design patterns.

    push to production quicker. Nevertheless, when you're working with large, complicated
    applications (especially ones that pertain to machine learning), multiple inheritance
    can be difficult to manage and maintain. In this guide, we'll learn how to use
    multiple inheritance and make it sustainable.

    name and structure to a method in a superclass or base class, which method will
    be called first from the subclass? Your class hierarchy may have functions and

    of the Object class. When we're trying to understand the call order of methods
    and variables in Python, you must always remember this information when trying
    to map out the method call order of your program.
