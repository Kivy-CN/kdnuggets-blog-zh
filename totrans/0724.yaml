- en: Lately, I have been focusing on data storytelling and its importance in effectively
    communicating the results of data analysis to generate value. However, my technical
    background, which is very close to the world of data management and its problems,
    pushed me to reflect on what data management needs to ensure you can build data-driven
    stories quickly. I came to a conclusion that is often taken for granted but is
    always good to keep in mind. You can’t rely only on data to build data-driven
    stories. It is also necessary for a data management system to consider at least
    two aspects. Do you want to know which ones? Let's try to find out in this article.

    data is and what types of data exist? Let's try to define it.

    information. There are different types of data:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    The main pros of this type of data are that it’s easy to derive insights. The
    main drawback is that schema dependence limits scalability. A database is an example
    of this type of data.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Semi-structured data** is partially organized without a fixed schema, such
    as JSON XML. The pros are that they are more flexible than structured data. The
    main cons is that the meta-level structure may contain unstructured data. Examples
    are annotated text, such as tweets with hashtags.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Unstructured data**, such as audio, video, and text, are not annotated. The
    main pros are that they are unstructured, so it’s easy to store them. They are
    also very scalable. However, they are challenging to manage. For example, it’s
    difficult to extract meaning. Plain text and digital photos are examples of unstructured

    manages and provides ways to consume or process structured, semi-structured, and
    unstructured data. Ingesting raw data permits a data lake to ingest historical
    and real-time data in a raw storage system.

    figure, to make the data consumable by the upper layers (reports, dashboarding,

    since it does not require any preliminary processing. The main drawback of a data
    lake is that since it ingests raw data, it does not support the semantics and
