- en: Whether you're a novice data science enthusiast setting up TensorFlow for the
    first time, or a seasoned AI engineer working with terabytes of data, getting
    your libraries, packages, and frameworks installed is always a struggle.

- en: While containerization tools like [Docker](https://docker.com) have truly revolutionized
    reproducibility in software, they haven't quite caught on yet in the data science
    and AI communities, and for good reason! With constantly evolving machine learning
    frameworks and algorithms, it can be tough to find time to dedicate towards learning
    another developer tool, especially one that isn't directly linked to the model
    building process.

- en: In this blog post, I'm going to show you how you can use one simple python package
    to setup your environment for any of the popular data science and AI frameworks,
    using just a few simple steps. Datmo leverages Docker under the hood and streamlines
    the process to help you get running quickly and easily, without the steep learning
    curve.
