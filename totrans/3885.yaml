    process. It is now time for the most important step in the interview process,
    namely, the **take-home coding challenge**. This is generally a data science problem,
    e.g., machine learning model, linear regression, classification problem, time
    series analysis, etc.

- en: Data science coding projects vary in scope and complexity. Sometimes, the project
    could be as simple as producing summary statistics, charts, and visualizations.
    It could also involve building a regression model, classification model, or forecasting
    using a time-dependent dataset. The project could also be very complex and difficult.
    In this case, no clear guidance is provided as to the specific type of model to
    use. In this case, you’ll have to come up with your own model that is best suitable
    for addressing project goals and objectives.

    a dataset. If you are fortunate, they may provide a small dataset that is clean
    and stored in a comma-separated value (CSV) file format. That way, you don’t have
    to worry about mining the data and transforming it into a form suitable for analysis.
    For the couple of interviews I had, I worked with 2 types of datasets: one had
    160 observations (rows), while the other had 50,000 observations with lots of
    missing values. The take-home coding exercise clearly differs from companies to
    companies, as further described below.'

    small (160 rows and 9 columns), and the instructions are very clear. So, all that
    is needed is to follow the instructions and generate your code. Notice also that
    the instruction clearly specifies that python must be used as the programming

    was three days. Only the final Jupyter notebook has to be submitted, and no formal

    passenger density, and crew are not provided as well. The *passenger_density*
    feature seems to have been derived from other features, but there is no explanation
    of how it was derived. These kinds of issues can be addressed by contacting the
    interview team to ask more about the dataset. It is important to understand the
    intricacies of your data before using it for building real-world models. Keep

    features into PCA space before training your model. This is important because
    multi-collinearity between features can lead to a model that is complex and difficult
    to interpret. PCA can also be used for variable selection and dimensionality reduction.
    In this case, only components that contribute significantly to the total explained
    variance can be retained and used for modeled building.

    algorithms such as **Linear Regression (LR)**, **KNeighbors Regression (KNR)**,
    and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**. The dataset has to be divided into training,
    validation, and test sets. Hyperparameter tuning has to be used to fine-tune the
    model in order to prevent overfitting. Cross-validation is essential to ensure
    the model performs well on the validation set. After fine-tuning model parameters,
    the model is applied has to be applied to the test dataset. The model’s performance
    on the test dataset is approximately equal to what would be expected when the
    model is used for making predictions using unseen data.

    The model is evaluated in a production setting in order to assess its performance.
    Any mistakes encountered when transforming from an experimental model to its actual
    performance on the production line has to be analyzed. This can then be used in
    fine-tuning the original model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on the mean cross-validation score from **Figure 3**, we observe that
    Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression perform almost at the same level
    and better than KNeighbors Regression. So, the final model selected could either
    be Linear Regression or Support Vector Regression.
