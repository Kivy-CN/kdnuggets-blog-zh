    (Quan *et al.*, 2023) is a new approach to revolutionizing software development
    using the Generative Agents. The premise that researchers propose is how the entire
    software development process could be streamlined and unified using natural language
    communication from Large Language Models (LLM). The tasks include developing code,
    generating the documents, analyzing the requirements, and many more.

    two major challenges: hallucination and lack of cross-examination in decision-making.
    To address these problems, the researchers propose a chat-based software development
    framework called ChatDev.'

    In each phase, the ChatDev would establish several agents with various roles,
    for example, code reviewers, software programmers, etc. To ensure the communication
    between agents runs smoothly, the researchers developed a chat chain that divided
    the phases into sequential atomic subtasks. Each subtask would implement collaboration
    and interaction between the agents.'

- en: Evaluating LLMs' ability is still an open question within the community and
    the fields. Three points that limit the ability to evaluate LLM properly are limited
    evaluation abilities by the tasks, vulnerable benchmarks, and unobjective metrics.
    To handle these problems, [Lin *et al.*, 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04026.pdf)
    proposed a task-based evaluation as an LLM benchmark in their paper. This approach
    hoped to become standard in evaluating the LLM's works as it could alleviate all
    the problems raised. To achieve this, the researchers introduce a framework called
    AgentSims.
