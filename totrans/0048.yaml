    them have been awful. Typically, the most common first interaction with a chatbot
    is to ask it if you can speak to a human.

    to the internet itself. Traditionally, search engines make heavy use of keywords,
    which creates the problem that the search engine needs to be programmed to be
    aware of synonyms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, consider the case of trying to search through a marketing report
    to find the part on customer segmentation. You press CMD+F, type "segmentation",
    and cycle through hits until you find something. Unfortunately, you miss the cases
    where the author of the doc wrote "classification" instead of "segmentation".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Semantic search (searching on *meaning*) solves this synonym problem by automatically
    finding text with similar meanings. The idea is that you use an embedding model—a
    deep learning model that converts text to a numeric vector according to its meaning—and
    then finding related text is just simple linear algebra. Even better, many embedding
    models allow other data types like images, audio, and video as inputs, letting
    you provide different input data types or output data types for your search.

    bloated with menus, buttons, and tools that users can't find or figure out how
    to use. Natural language interfaces, where users want to explain what they want
    in a sentence, can dramatically improve the useability of software. "Natural language
    interface" can refer to either spoken or typed ways of controlling software. The
    key is that you can use standard human-understandable sentences.

    large language model. GPT 4.0 is the current gold standard for performance, but
    there are many open-source alternatives like Llama 2, Falcon, and Mistral.

    Python and JavaScript. JavaScript is important for web applications, and Python

    The two main contenders are LangChain and LlamaIndex. LangChain is a broader framework
    that allows you to develop a wide range of generative AI applications, and LlamaIndex
    is more tightly focused on developing semantic search applications.

    startups are appearing every week, along with new tools. If you want to develop
    an application, expect to change parts of the software stack more frequently than
    you would with other applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In particular, new models are appearing regularly, and the best performer for
    your use case is likely to change. One common workflow is to start using APIs
    (for example, the OpenAI API for the API and the Pinecone API for the vector database)
    since they are quick to develop. As your userbase grows, the cost of API calls
    can become burdensome, so at this point, you may want to switch to open-source
    tools (the Hugging Face ecosystem is a good choice here).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While many tasks can be achieved using a single exchange back and forth with
    the LLM, use cases like chatbots require a long conversation. OpenAI recently
    announced a "threads" feature as part of their Assistants API, which you can learn
    about in the [OpenAI Assistants API Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/open-ai-assistants-api-tutorial).
  prefs: []

    an embedding model (see [Introduction to Text Embeddings with the OpenAI API](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-text-embeddings-with-the-open-ai-api))
    that converts the text (or other input) into a numeric vector that represents
    its meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Searching just means writing a search query, and asking which entries in the database
    correspond most closely to the thing you asked for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you could take some FAQs on one of your company's products, embed
    them, and upload them into a vector database. Then, you ask a question about the
    product, and it will return the closest matches, converting back from a numeric
    vector to the original text.

    isn't enough. Often, you want the text to be processed in a way that answers the
    query more naturally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution to this is a technique known as retrieval augmented generation
    (RAG). This means that after you retrieve your text from the vector database,
    you write a prompt for an LLM, then include the retrieved text in your prompt
    (you *augment* the prompt with the *retrieved* text). Then, you ask the LLM to
    write a human-readable answer.
