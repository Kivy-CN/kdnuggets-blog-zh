- en: Being on the job hunt is tough, there’s no two ways about it. Sending out resumes,
    re-writing cover letters, the interminable wait between applying and waiting to
    hear back (or just getting ghosted) – it’s not fun.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The good news is it’s a lot easier than it used to be. You don’t have to physically
    mail or drop off letters anymore; you can do a lot of applications with a few
    button clicks. There are plenty of specialized job boards, interview prep tools,
    and additional resources to make it more likely to find, apply, and actually get
    your dream data science job.

- en: It doesn’t matter how shiny your resume is if you don’t have the skills to back
    up your credentials. One of the best ways to get data science skills is by doing
    your own projects.
  prefs: []

- en: It’s sometimes tricky to get ideas for data science projects, which is where
    [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) comes in. Kaggle hosts a huge log of datasets,
    machine learning competitions, and includes answers and different approaches for
    how to tackle various projects.

- en: It's an excellent resource because it allows you to apply your data science
    skills in practical scenarios, receive feedback, and learn from the solutions
    of others. Not only that, but if you actually win a Kaggle competition, that can
    serve as a bit of a flex to any employers. Most data scientists know of Kaggle
    and will be suitably impressed that you can tackle those problems.
  prefs: []

    problems.  It offers valuable exposure to industry-level problems – and the opportunity
    to be noticed by top companies.

- en: 'I may be slightly biased here as the founder of [StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=kdn+ds+job+resources),
    but I founded the company because I noticed a real problem: it’s hard to prep
    for data science interviews. So I started collecting interview questions from
    as many different companies as I could and categorizing them by difficulty, type
    of question, and company. The result is a database of over a thousand real-life
    interview questions – both coding and non-coding – plus the solutions if you’re
    really stumped.'

- en: In my experience interviewing for data science jobs, it’s not just about having
    the skills, it’s also about being able to stay calm and think through whatever
    they throw your way. As you might imagine, it’s a lot easier to do that if you’ve
    seen the interview question – or some variation of it – before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s a good idea to practice interview questions at every stage in your data
    science job hunt, too, not just when you have an interview lined up. Practicing
    IRL interview questions gives you a sense of what problems data science companies
    are interested in solving, as well as the skills you should focus on learning
    or honing.

    have very expensive data science courses, you can get all the same knowledge absolutely
    for free simply by auditing the courses. Now, this means you don’t get a certificate
    of your accomplishments, which can definitely be valuable, but you do get world-class
    lessons, tutorials, and guides for free.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re reading this on [KDNuggets](/), so you should already know it’s a useful
    resource to get a data science job. KDNuggets doesn’t just offer blog posts, though.
    There are [datasets](/datasets/index.html) (again, useful for projects), live
    and virtual [events](/meetings/index.html) (great for networking), programming
    [cheat sheets](/cheat-sheets/index.html), and curated [tool recommendations](/kdnuggets-recommends).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m throwing in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), too,
    since it’s another blog packed with tutorials, guides, how-tos, personal stories
    and experiences, and more. While some stories are paywalled, many are left free.
    You can easily browse the TDS homepage and look for free stories that don’t have
    a little star next to the author's name.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data scientists. Many of them are kind enough to post content online for free
    for you to read and enjoy.

    LinkedIn and Indeed definitely win in terms of volume, but I love [Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/)
    to find data science jobs for the curated aspect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are powerful. You can easily find jobs based on investment round, salary, equity,
    markets, company size, and more.

    it might be time to turn your sights to a different scene. Startups are hungry
    for data science talent, and if you can broaden your horizons to consider a slightly
    less conventional employer, you might have better luck.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Three, it’s just a bit newer and fresher, so I find it to be a better job-hunting
    experience. Features include telling you who invested in the company, how recently
    the recruiter was reviewing applicants, and pulling in stats from Glassdoor about
    leadership and life/work balance ratings.

    of companies ghosting more, making you sit through multiple rounds of interviews
    only to say the position was actually filled internally, or just straight up [posting
    non-existent jobs](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/job-openings-fake-listings-ads-federal-reserve-jolts/)
    to make themselves look better in front of potential investors. Perhaps you’ve
    even run into a [scam job posting](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/08/scammers-impersonate-well-known-companies-recruit-fake-jobs-linkedin-and-other-job-platforms).
