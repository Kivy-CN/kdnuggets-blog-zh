    involves manually intensive processes using spreadsheets that require input from
    various levels of an organization. This approach introduces bias and is generally
    not accurate especially during the initial few weeks of a quarter. In fact that's
    the time when an accurate forecast has the most benefit after all there's little
    value in providing an accurate forecast in the last week of a quarter.

    to determine its accuracy. One simply has to wait until the end of a forecasting
    period (e.g. end of quarter) and then compare forecasts with actuals. We are confident
    about the accuracy of our models and are inviting sales leaders to our [**Man
    vs Machine Forecasting Duel**](http://www.springml.com/sales-forecasting-challenge)
    - give us a day with your data and we'll provide an algorithm based, unbiased
    forecast. At the end of the quarter you can evaluate our number by comparing with
    your internal forecast. Get started by visiting [www.springml.com/sales-forecasting-challenge](http://www.springml.com/sales-forecasting-challenge)
    and submitting the form. The process is simple and allows you to quickly see what
    machine learning can do for your organization.

    run automatically and present a monthly or quarterly forecast of a customer's
    sales metric (e.g. Revenue, ACV, quantity). Sales leaders can These models consume
    both historical data to gauge trend and seasonality, as well as current pipeline
    of opportunities to then predict for the next 6 or 12 months. Accurate forecasts
    allow organizations to make informed business decisions. It gives insight into
    how a company should manage its resources - people, time and cash.

    analysis. This is a tool that allows sales leaders to determine impact of certain
    factors on sales numbers. This type of analysis helps them determine what types
    of levers they have access to and what impact, either positive or negative, they
    can have on the sales. This advanced What-If analysis is based on machine learning
    where the model gets executed every time a user interacts with the tool. Some
    of the variables used in this analysis are number of sales reps, average deal
    duration, average deal amount, percent win rate. For example a sales manager can
    see what happens if they increase recruiting or if determine impact of a discounting
    program they have been considering. This list of features is configurable and
    can include other factors that may be more meaningful to a company.
